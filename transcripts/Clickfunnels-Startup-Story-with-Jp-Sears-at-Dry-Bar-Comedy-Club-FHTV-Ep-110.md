## Transcript
Did you feel like a loser getting married at 22 and still counting on your dad for money? Did you feel like you were marrying a loser? I'm inviting you to a very special, really, really cool event with someone who I have huge respect for named Anna Warner at a place called the Drybar Comedy Club in Provo, Utah. We've got a large team coming down and we have a click from the startup stories. We're heading on our way right now. I'm heading over to meet JP at D Gates. So JP's hiding because he's so popular. He has to literally hide behind corners and let's go! Yeah, they keep coming. Yeah, for sure. So excited. Yeah, me too. And Dave has just been amazing and weird. Good to see you. Nice to see you too. Andrew. You need two guys following you around cameras? Yeah, they always follow us everywhere. I feel at home when I'm hanging with you guys because you guys are obviously children dressed up in adult bodies. So playful and I'm just like, I'm not the only one. I love it. We've got about three hours until the live show starts and so when you go throw stuff up there real quick, then we'll go see the venue because I stress out and probably see the venue. Whenever I speak in the venue, I have to go and like step on the stage the night before or else I decide to stick to my stomach. So we go check it out. We picked Drybar Comedy Club because Mormons can't drink and so this is like the dry bar and so it'd be kind of funny and then people always ask us our story and like you always hear like the highlight of the story but I thought it'd be fun. Andrew's a really good interview and I'll look deep into like the ups and the downs and so I thought I'd just tell the whole story. Ready? Let's go! We're here. This is the entourage. Oh, we're walking into the Drybar Comedy Club! Oh, this is amazing. I've only seen pictures of this online. That's why we picked it but I haven't seen it inside. All right, we just got to Drybar Comedy Club and check it out. This is like the coolest location I think I've ever seen. So this is office goals right here. We are here Harm Brothers slash Bitangels slash Drybar Comedy Club. The ambiance of this room is so cool. I saw pictures online and it looks cool. This is like a million times cool. It's like tighter and more like you're all hanging out together. Well, we were we were gonna get six stick figures or something like that or a little kind of cut out poster things and Miles actually came up with this idea. I don't know where Miles is. Miles said let's go oversized. So this Russell hates pictures of himself. He absolutely hates it and I don't think he knew about this but he always hates his chin so I kind of fixed it a little bit phone shop so he's good. I'm just kidding. We only have like 30 40 minutes left and as you can tell there's still a whole bunch of stuff that's got to get done so hopefully we're gonna pull this thing off. Got the tech issues. We forgot to have press release passes printed and all that kind of stuff so we're getting those printed. I'm a little nervous. I don't know why I'm lying. I hope people show up. That's my biggest fear. If they will. The venue holds about 200 or so seats. We sold 250. I'm nervous like if they don't come that's gonna be horrible. Too many comments. Kiethiacke here. I'm actually the emcee tonight and I don't feel any pressure at all because I just get to go have fun and get to introduce my friends and it's going to be a blast. You didn't need to do something for those. Thanks for telling me now. I give you a hand. Now I'm stressed. Man I just held up your head for a picture. Well right on. Oh I know you are. All right the party is starting to get started. People are coming in sort of fill up the venue. Starting like 30 minutes or so. What's up everybody. You guys excited. We have an amazing night planned for you. Without further ado will you help me bring up the most spiritual man in the world. According to himself guys give it up for JP Sears. Sincerely I am delighted to be here with you and just for bringing me in one more time I want to thank lead pages. Thank you guys. A few weeks ago Russell called me up and said JP would you be willing to come to this event and you know just like make fun of me for a little while and talk about me. I said like that doesn't even sound narcissistic. So I called up in Fusionsoft and said hey do you guys need me on the 20th. Thank you guys for having fun with me. I appreciate y'all. In every industry there's somebody that comes along that really disrupts the industry that really changes it and that really does something amazing for that industry and as we all know that person is Russell Bronson. Give it up guys. All right thanks for coming you guys. This is so cool. I want to introduce the person who's going to be doing the interview tonight and it's someone I'm really excited to have here. Let's put our hands together for Mr. Andrew Warner. I want to make it meaningful for you. I've talked to a lot of you as you were coming in here. You want to know how they got here. What worked for Clickfunnels. What would work for us and so that's my goal here to spend the time understanding by interviewing you about how you did it. So what we learned tonight was that Russell went to an amusement park when he was just a little kid and his favorite food was a funnel cake. Clickfunnels started as a food truck. So they started with funnel cakes and then it morphed on into funnels. It was great. I was a little embarrassed for them but they would have to lie about it for so long and not tell anyone and that's the origin story. It was really weird to walk in and see Russell sipping on Patron Tequila. Nobody saw it coming and it's like when he revealed to us that he was hypnotist. I looked around and there was like half the audience had their pants down. It was insane. It was insane. Such a good event. The most awkward part was when Russell started to cry. Why is he crying? Curl up in a fetal position on stage in front of 260 people for a half hour. That blew my mind. Yeah so everything else was good minus the lies. All right let's start with the very first business. What's this one? This is called Sublime Net. How many of you guys remember Sublime Net out there? Anyway I don't know. I wanted to sell software and so I was like what could I name my company and so I figured out exciting software. Someone by ExciteWear.com but it wasn't for sale and so I bought ExciteWear.net and Clut was working at the time and she came home and I was so excited. I'm like we got our first website. We're gonna be rich and I told her the name. I was like ExciteWear.net and she looked at me with this look like she's like are we are you selling underwear or what is the... I was like at lingerie. I'm like you know it's software and then she's like I'm not gonna tell my mom that you bought that. Like you have to think of another name and I was like crap and so that was the next best name I came up with with Sublime Net. I feel like the band Sublime. And I was gonna ask you what it was but it was lots of different things. Every screenshot on there is a whole other business under the same name. What are the businesses? Do you remember? There was website hosting. There's affiliate sites. There were... I remember the first thing I ever sold was a it was an affiliate product. I sold... I made 20 bucks on it through my PayPal account because I remember that night I do remember I celebrated. We went out to dinner and had a PayPal credit card and then we bought dinner with 20 bucks and then the guy refunded like the next day. Oh, so sad. And then you started something that I never heard about but this is the call center. The call center got to how many employees? A hundred? We had about 60 full-time sales people, 20 full-time coaches, about 20 people doing the marketing stuff. It's about 100 people in the whole company. A hundred people? What happened? Why did that close down? Oh man, a lot of things. A lot of bad mistakes. A lot of first time growing company stuff. Again, we just woke up one day. It felt like and we were in this huge office, huge overhead and about that time it was like 99, 2000 something like that. And there was a the merchant account that me and most of the people doing the internet marketing at time, we all used the same merchant account and they got hit by Visa and Mastercard and so they freaked out and they shut down. I think that ended up being like four or five hundred merchant accounts overnight and we had nine different merchant accounts that company all of them got shut down instantly. And I remember because everything was fine. We're going through the day and it was like one o'clock in the afternoon on a Friday they came in like, hey, none of the built the card's won't process and and finally it's someone on the phone and they said, oh yeah, if you got shut down along with everybody along with all the other scammers and she hung up on me and I was like, I don't know what to do right now. Like I've got a hundred plus people and payroll is not small and we didn't have a ton of cash in the bank. It was just like a it was more of a cash flow business and I remember Avatar just came out. So everyone's going to movie Avatar and I remember sitting there during the longest movie of all time like and I don't remember anything other than like the sick feeling in my stomach and I was like texting everyone I know like trying to see like if anyone knew what to do and everyone knew was like, we got shut down too. We got shut down and everyone got shut down and like so the next we came back the next day I called everyone up and we had to figure out how to save this and Brent and John everyone then came back to my house and I was like, okay, what ideas do we got? And we just sat there for the next five or six hours trying to figure stuff out and then went to work and and I wish I could say like everything turned around but it was next probably man two or three years of us firing 30 people firing 20 people closing things down moving down offices like just shrinking for a long long time until the peak of it was got an email from my dad who was helping with the books at the time he said, hey, I got really bad news for you. I looked through the books and it turns out your assistant who was supposed to be doing payroll taxes hadn't paid payroll in over a year is like you're the IRS over 170,000 dollars and it's like and if you don't pay this like you're probably gonna go to jail and I was like every penny I'd earned at that point was gone. Everything was done. We lost everything and I was just like I don't I don't know how to fight this battle but if I don't fight it like I go to jail apparently and I remember I remember um that's that's a really crappy feeling yeah and uh Brent some of you guys are reliving this with me right now I know um and remember going back that night laying in bed and I was just like I wish that I had a boss that could fire me because I don't know what to do or how to do it and that was kind of that was the definitely the little spot for me and you stuck with him I've talked to a few of your people because they're so good I keep asking them why do you work for Russell what is it that lets you be second to Russell who's getting all the attention and I've got some answers and would you would you mind coming up here and back then when it wasn't going so well give me an example of something that he did to let you know this is a guy who's gonna figure it out eventually and I could possibly go down watch him go to jail but I believe that it's gonna go up well at the time when when things are crashing the income stopped and uh I asked if I could talk to him and sat down and I pretty much told him like I I can't keep doing this I can't keep watching you you know every month pulling the money you've saved for your family to try to try to you know keep jobs for other people like I said I will I'll leave you know if that helps you and uh and the fact that he he did he stuck with he stuck with people and you know some people call it faith or belief like he has this inherent like belief that he can truly change people's lives that's it even when he wasn't fully in control of his own it was the fact that we were bootstrapped like we didn't have money to just like throw out there we had we had to make sure that we were earning enough money to cover our ads right and Russell had all the trust in the world in me I don't know why he did but he did and he's just like spend money and just try to make it self-liquid and I'm like okay right so we just had to spend money and hope that we got enough back to keep spending money and self-liquidate means buy an ad today and make sure that we make money from that ad right away and then software yeah and then you told and then software is going to pay over time that's our legacy that's our thing what's your ad budget now we spend about half a million a month half a million a month yeah don't don't tell the accountants and you're a partner too yeah wow congratulations thank you it's always now it's always now it's always now it's always now it's never gonna be the next funnel it's never gonna be the next product launch like I'm gonna do whatever we can right now and the next one and the next one that's it that's who you are that's how it works and now you're a partner in the business 83 million dollars so far this year you got a piece of that yes do I just check it how do you support yourself while this was not working I didn't so my beautiful wife did she had two jobs at the time to support me while I was wrestling and doing these things and she was the one that made it possible to be able to gamble and risk and try crazy things everyone this is cool my beautiful wife what did you see in him back then that let you say I'm gonna work extra hard and pay for what he's not doing what did I see in him it was actually um his energy his spirit was always positive and we had the same goals and that's a thing I noticed too the positivity what was how did you cut up your credit cards what was that day like hard uh-huh yeah hard because I those that you don't know that know that I'm a little bit older than Russell and so I've always had this independency to go do and buy and do these things and then I was said to my whole step back sister gonna take care of this young man so we can get to her anyway but now yeah now things are good now things are amazing yeah so I stopped asking about religion but I get this sense that you believe that is any of this does it feel divinely inspired to you be honest I believe that that god gives us talents and gifts and abilities and then watches who would do with it and if we do good he gives us increases our capacity to do more but we definitely and especially in time at the office we talk about a lot like we definitely feel what we do is a spiritual mission that gets you do 100 yeah I don't I don't think that it's just like we're lucky I think the way that the people have come the the partnerships like how was created is super inspired you know what a lot of us are selling things that our software pdf guide this that it's really hard to find the bigger mission in it you're finding the bigger bigger mission in funnels what is what is that bigger mission what how really how do you connect with it because you're right if you can find that bigger meaning then the work becomes more meaningful and the people you're working with become like it's it's more exciting to work with and more meaningful to do it how did you find it in funnels what is the meaning so right now as of I think today we had 68 000 members in click funnels which is like the big number we all brag about but for me it's like that's 68 000 entrepreneurs each one has a gift right and so I think about one like one member all mentioned his name is Chris work he runs chrisby's cancer chrisbycancer.com and chris was someone who came down with cancer and given the death sentence and instead of going through chemotherapy decided I'm gonna see if I can heal myself and he he did clear himself for cancer and then instead of just like cool and then go back into work he was like and I need to help other people and so we started the blog started doing some things and and now he's gotten this thing where he's helped thousands and thousands of people to naturally cure themselves of cancer and that's one of our 68 000 people right that's the thing that's the thing keeps me going I really appreciate you being open being willing to let me take this anywhere you said I understand what Andrew's trying to do is trying to figure this out I'm gonna let him run with it and let him make the magic happen and I think we've made a lot of magic happen thanks so much for having me here yeah man it was amazing thank you thank you all for coming I'm looking forward to meeting every one of you
