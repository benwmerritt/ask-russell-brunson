Meet Steve, an office worker who's about to get his first gold digger. I am. Hi Steve. This wasn't your dream, living in a cubicle prison. You had the American dream. You were gonna start your own company. Be your own boss. Make money while you sleep. Debbie from HR says it's a bad idea. Debbie's a bad idea. She says 90% of businesses fail. 90% of Debbie fails. Do I know you? But actually she's right. But that's just because 90% of them have been doing it wrong. Back in the gold rush, business was simple. One, find gold. Two, the end. But now business is online. And maybe you got a great business idea, but your site sucks at selling it. Like Debbie. I'm not supposed to sell. I'm in HR. That's what they all say. That's because cheap website builders offer templates based on looks. Not data-driven sales principles. The site that doesn't sell is like panning for gold with a holy bucket. No matter how much goes in, it all drains out. No matter how many website visitors, you get no sales. So your business dies, along with your dreams. If you really wanted to sell, you ditch your site and build a funnel. A funnel's a series of online steps that turns your potential customers into paying customers. It walks them through the sale online, just like you would in person. Use in ClickFunnels.com. The low-cost, no-coding way to build a money-making funnel. It's like your own personal money printer. But without the felony, I ain't going back to jail. ClickFunnels makes online selling easy. It has customizable templates for every part of your funnel, from landing page to checkout. It's so simple, my mule could do it. If she weren't blind, she wouldn't bring her safety goggles. Dumbass. Want to be a best-selling author? There's a funnel for that. Want to capture leads? There's a funnel for that. Sell a product, sell a service, sell to other businesses. There's funnels for that. Heck, you can even sell your sale. No, not prostitution, sicko. Like a public speaker or illustrator or hooker. A typical user who ditches their site for a ClickFunnel increases their sales by 540%. That's five times more sales. If it were any better at taking people's money, it'd be called the IRS. We're so confident in the power of ClickFunnels, we'll give you a free 14-day trial.

Now you could build the funnel yourself. If you want to pay for coding, design, hosting, website building and A.B. testing. But that's thousands of dollars and months of time. It's how my first company died. We buried it next to my first wife. It's a company and my first wife. ClickFunnels on the other hand has everything you need for a monthly rate starting at just $97.
