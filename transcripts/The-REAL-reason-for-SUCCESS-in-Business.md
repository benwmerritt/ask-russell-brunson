I never thought that my faith would lead to a police raid that saved the lives of hundreds of children. But this story changed my life forever. I have a belief that, honestly, entrepreneurship and business, that it's not just, like, a thing that we pursue in this life. I have a belief that it's literally, like, a calling from God. And so it's interesting because I look back on my journey, like, why in the world did... 19 years ago when I kind of started this thing, I was a kid who struggled in school, but then I started learning about marketing. And for some reason there was, like, this spark where I was interested. And I don't think it's unique to me or to anybody. And I think the people who pursue it, as you start down that path, God gives you more gifts and gives you more ideas and more inspiration. Like, there's so many times where I don't know what the next product's gonna be, the next thing, and I'm looking like, there's the people I'm supposed to serve. What do they need? And as I ask those questions, I start thinking about it and praying about it. Like, that's when the ideas come. I think a lot of times people think faith is this thing of, like, you're blindly just walking in the dark and hoping that something's true. I think faith is not knowing where you're going, but, like, I'm gonna take that next step. And, like, the pathway that can come shown to you. I got called by somebody who asked if we'd be interested in helping with an organization called Operation Underground Railroad. And at the time I'd never heard of that. It was a charity that helped save kids from sex slavery. I remember researching it and breaking down and just realizing, like, my life will never be the same. And I wanted to help, but I didn't know how to help. But I wanted to help, so initially I was like, what do I know how to do? Like, I know how to build a funnel. So I put it together in this structure and it got closer and closer to when I was gonna meet with the founder. I remember I was getting ready and I had a long drive, four or five-hour drive, to go meet with him. And I was sitting there and I was just like, I have everything prepared. I'm gonna show him. Hopefully he likes it. And I remember saying a prayer and just saying, hey, I want to make sure this is the right thing. I want to make sure this is what you want me to do. And this is gonna be the thing that helps the most. And in that moment, like, I had this really weird impression. And the impression was like, you should make a documentary for this organization. And I remember the first thing, like, I don't know how to make a documentary. I've never done that before. And then the next impression came, there's this guy named Nick Natten, who you met five years ago. He's won a whole bunch of Emmys for documentaries. He's the one who's gonna do the documentary. And I was like, I met this guy for maybe 30 seconds. I don't know if he knows who I am, but it was so clear, like, you make a documentary, Nick Natten's gonna do it for you. And so I pull out my phone right then on, again, this is like the leap of faith. I went on Facebook, I found Nick Natten, a friend requested him, and then I sent him a message. I was like, hey, I just had this really weird thing. And I feel like I'm supposed to make a documentary. And this may sound weird, but like, you're the one who needs to make the video. And a few minutes later, I got a call back from Nick and he was like, this is the most amazing thing I've ever heard of. He's like, not only am I willing to the documentary, I'll do it at cost. If you can cover the hard costs of our team or our production, I'll take no profits, no royalties. I want to do this as a gift. And this is all within like a 15 minute window. So then I'm like, okay, scrap all our plans, we're making a documentary. I gotta go pitch Tim Ballard, the founder of this organization, that we're making a documentary. And he was just like, this is what we need. This is the thing. He said, if you look at this prom, it says there's over two million children right now in sex slavery around the world. He said, right now it's in the darkness, nobody knows about it. It's hidden. It's like you're in a room, there's always cockroaches in the dark and you can't see them, but you know that they're all there. And he said, the only way to get rid of the cockroaches in a dark room is to shine a light in the middle. And he said, this is going to be the thing that we create to shine the light. The making of the documentary was crazy because they went to Haiti to go interview the father of this boy you got taken that kind of started the whole, you are. Also, it ended with an actual capture of the rest. So they're in this van like setting up the sting operation, make sure everything's happening and they're going. And one of the guys, he had this inspiration like, I need you to put a GoPro on my helmet. And they do we're about to start, he's like, you need to do this right now. So grabs like, like electrical tape, this GoPro to this helmet and click record. And then the whole thing, the rest happened. And in the middle of the rest, the OUR guy was like kind of walking around side and he looked over and they found the lady, but they haven't found her broth lady. The more is that he looks over and he sees this door, there's just a door and there's these little kids like peeking out and then I close it. He was like, oh my gosh, I think that's the broth. So he runs over, opens it up, runs in and he finds how much people in the act. These kids, the people get up and they run out. They catch the guys because they weren't prepared for that. And then he comes back out and the guys just like went in there and we can have backup, lots of people. And then Tim's looking at the guy's helmet. Like the cameras are in a little flashing red light. They captured all the people in the act, the footage, the evidence, all their faces and they're able to arrest all the people and put them all in jail. How in the world did that dude know two minutes ago to get the evidence to strap a GoPro to his helmet? We had a million miracles in the story of how the documentary was made. We showed it at our next Funnel Hacking Live event. And the people in the room, we saw a documentary, were so touched that they ended up raising over a million dollars for Operation on the Ground Railroad that night, which is enough to save like 400 children from sex slavery. In the last couple of years, it's been seen over a million times. I actually had a call with Tim Ballard, the founder of OUR about a month ago. He said, to this day, the thing that has driven the most money and helped save the most kids inside this organization is the documentary operation to save. And it all came from this moment of listening and then having faith. Like, I don't know how to make a documentary, but I'm going to take that step and then we'll see where it goes and then take the next step. The documentary now has been seen by over a million people around the world. They saved over 4,000 children to date. And if anyone wants to watch that documentary, see how they can help, there's a link down below where they go to OURfilm.org. I think it's powerful when you start seeing how God's hand is in all of this. I think for any entrepreneur, when you realize that, hey, I've been called a server group of people. If I really care about them, if I really want to serve them, if I'm listening with the right ears, the inspiration for what to create, how to serve them, what to do next will just come to you. Business is a calling from God, but the coolest thing for us is that we've been called to change the lives of the group of people. And so when you do that, you literally have this chance to change people's lives, which in exchange, changed your life as well. And that's why it's so powerful.
