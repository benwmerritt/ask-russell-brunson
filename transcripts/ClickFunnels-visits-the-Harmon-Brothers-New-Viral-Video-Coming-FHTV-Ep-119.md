## Transcript
Let's be quiet just for a second in case they're in the middle of a take. I think it sounds like they're setting up. Oh no! This is our third video with the Harman Brothers and our first one we ended up doing the Newt Squirrel. I like to paint Newts. Squirrels that is. The second one, we still use the prospector but it was the death of the website. We're gathered here today to celebrate the death of your website! It's potentially the funniest video we've done yet. We got some really super cool stuff. We're gonna try to get a little bit of behind the scenes for you guys here. Hang tight and watch it. So this is the bright building where the Harman Brothers office is. Come on in. This is the best thing ever. Let me explain you what a funnel is. Action when you're ready. Oh my gosh. Let me introduce you to Bad Kelly here. So Kelly is one of the writers. She's also the actor in this. I didn't even recognize her. I remember we were actually up at the cabin and she was writing. That was not what she looked like. That is Bad Kelly. Not what I looked like. Although I do think this is what I will look like. She's going to this. Future look here. This is my future. Alright so we're on shoot 34. As we're coming in here. Check this out. Let's see what happens. Not exactly sure why Keaton is wearing the cowboy cap. It helps me get into freedom. Keaton, how many scenes are in this? 41. 41? How are you doing through this Kelly? Good. She keeps drinking water and spilling it on my pants. That's so funny. Oh no. How wide is this? I just squeezed this. I'm not like this for a little bit wider. This is great behind the scenes of photo here. What are you doing? Trying to dry my pants. She's doing awesome. Alright guys we gotta get this shot. Alright.
