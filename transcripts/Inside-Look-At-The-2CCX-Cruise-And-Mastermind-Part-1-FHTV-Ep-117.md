Yes! Identity shapes behavior. Who's ready for a week of networking and schmoozing while Caribbean cruising? We're profitable businesses done while on vacation and having fun. Woo! Two comma club cruises. Let's get ready to rock that boat. Hey, my name is Joni. I'm just fluent from Seattle. From Mithaly. I'm from Slovakia, Sydney, Jersey. We're getting ready to go to the cruise. I'd like to take this opportunity and welcome you on board the beautiful Dermalige and Bliss. Alright, we're officially at sea and we're having our first official meeting here. We're everybody gathered around about to tell them what's happening, what to plan on, what to do, what to do. We're really excited to see what's happening. We've got a lot of people here. We've got a lot of people here. We've got a lot of people here. We've got a lot of people here. We've got a lot of people here. We've got a lot of people here. We're really excited to have this first official meeting here. Everybody gathered around about to tell them what's happening, what to plan on and then we get dinner because I'm starving and hoping it's going to time out. Awesome. Alright, I think we're ready. We're really excited. This trip's going to be fun. I think what I'm going to ask is, is this like going to be... It's okay, we're on a cruise. Oh, hi there, M80s. Are you guys better than have fun? Yeah! What happens next is... Everything! Woo! Goodbye, bad weather. Goodbye, civilization. Goodbye, host chores. Goodbye, work. Goodbye, cooking. Woo! We want people to be comfortable and relaxed and have that mindset of prosperity, inspiration, and profit. And I'm not awake yet. I want to go ahead and bring to stage Mr. James P. Freel. Right there, guys. Is the very first thing you need to do is adopt an identity. What is the identity of somebody who has the habit that you already want to have? For me, it was being a drummer. And I was like, well, if I'm a drummer, I got to practice like a drummer, right? If I just said, I'm not a drummer, I'm going to do a completely different set of things. Identity shapes behavior, and behavior shapes outcomes. So the first type of goal is called a result goal. That means this is the end thing that I'm trying to accomplish. Right? It could be, I want a million dollar funnel. The second goal, process goals. So the process goal is that the thing that I'm doing on a regular basis, the thing that I do every single day. What are the chances of me achieving and accomplishing the result goal if I never do the process goal? Zero. This is why we don't achieve our goals. You're saying like work on a habit until it becomes a habit, right? But then if I don't see the results from it, what happens I think probably to, I know like some of us in here, we've talked like, you move on to the next thing, you move on to the next thing, and you move on to the next thing, and then you're spinning your wheels. Yeah, it's an amazing question. It's aligning your expectations with what you think is reasonable, and then consistently doing small, simple things to get there and not uprooting the plant before it has a chance to like start sprouting. Thank you guys so much for your attention, I appreciate it. It's a killer. Accountability, process, identity, habits, ties it all together. We are at Teppanyaki and the food has been absolutely amazing. They make beats with their spatulas. They make jokes all night. It's basically a fun family event for a little while. Two, one. So we're trying to get B-roll footage of laser tag, and they're not letting the camera guys in. So Blake like snuck in the back door and slipped in, and we're watching the big monitors of the game, and we saw Blake like running around, filming all these little kids. He goes, no, we're not even in that session. Pretty awesome. I was like, bye myself, I'm like, here we go. Guess where we are? We are, actually I have no idea where we are. Tortilla, Tortuga. We're on the Toucon with Lovak's Cruising. You should be here, why aren't you here? It's like this place. You should be here. Go on to the baths at Tortola. Apparently it's this secluded place, and because the group is big enough, they can charter a private ship for us, so a little boat. So, where we going? You'll be looking green. You look like the Hulk. So I feel good, the green has gone down. Bruce Banner's back, I'm good. So what's it like being around all the funnel hackers out here? We actually get to connect and meet people in a relaxed setting, so we actually get to make some great connections. It's always more fun traveling to destinations and seeing awesome sights around the world while still meeting new people and doing business. We're under the palm trees, we're laying on the white sand beaches, we're snorkeling with each other, we're walking through caves. The environment is providing such an atmosphere of relaxation. As part of what being a funnel hacker is, being able to give yourself the freedom to go travel and to work remotely. One, two, three. Yes! Yes! Yes! It's ten people! Oh my gosh, come out. First drive. Amazing talent. I'm trying to practice kicking my leg up that high, but right now my leg's about this high. We just watched the Vanna show, we had second row seats, it was really fun. Clout loves those kind of things, so it was really good. But I'm all butterflies, like how do you follow up like a dance act? Like let's talk about business. Okay, so we're going to do a shot of the Vanna show. We're going to do a shot of the Vanna show, we're going to do a shot of the Vanna show, we're going to do a shot of the Vanna show, we're going to do a shot of the Vanna show, we're going to do a shot of the Vanna show, okay so we're going to do a shot that's really important for an ad, so I need you guys to help. It's going to be slightly awkward for me, it's going to be really awkward for me, slightly awkward for this guy too. I'm going to hold the book, he's going to put his arms around me, so he gives a shot, I need you guys to, what do you want me to do? To reach like you're trying to grab the book. I don't know his vision, but I promise it'll be amazing afterwards. Oh wow, you guys are entrepreneurs, the goal is not to go and build a business, it's to build a team. And all of these entrepreneurs, we have this big vision that we want to create, right? How do you get something that you want to do, what you want to create? So we have these big huge visions over here, right? And then we're like, alright, I'm going to go and actually do a shot of the Vanna show, I'm going to do a shot of the Vanna show, I'm going to do a shot of the Vanna show, alright, I'm going to go execute on this vision, and you start running, boom, they start running towards the vision, right? Second we have a boom, we're off to the races, we're going towards our vision, we're going towards our vision, going towards our vision, and all of a sudden, as we're going through, there's all these things that start coming up, right? Like this and this and this and this, every single time I would get hit with one of these hurdles, I would stop and I would say, how in the world do I program? Okay, I don't know, so I'm going to go change my major in university to programming, and I'll spend the next six years of my life learning programming so I can build ZipRander. That's how my mind was, that's how most of our minds are like, how do I do this? I have to figure it out, I'm going to switch my major and learn it, right? And all of a sudden you go on this detour, we're trying to figure out how in the world to do that thing, and this detour takes you on this path over here to a world that we call procrastination. The question how will lead you to procrastination, the question of who, we'll get you here the fastest, the question of who already knows how to do that. You figure out who already knows how, it changes everything. But it's the who not the how. And so on our journey, the biggest problem we have as entrepreneurs, if you're struggling at any point in this thing, it's because you're going down this path and you're like, I don't know how to do it, and you get stuck in this path of procrastination. Well it's super late and half of us are asleep, so I appreciate you guys hanging out for a midnight session, that was really, really cool. I'll see you guys in the morning, it'll be super fun, I'm excited. On the next episode of Funnel Hacker TV. Oh no, it's a lot of rain. Two, one, let's go. I won! The dirt and the sweat, and now you've tripled the exposure people have to you. No, no, no. We're in St. Thomas, it says some of the trees kill you, so I'm hoping we survive.
