So what if we demo it like actually showing a funnel? You get Coke and you put a Mentos in it and try to spray the Coke and see how much falls in the bottle without a funnel. It's really hard to get Coke in the top of a little bottle. Just like it's hard to get customers to buy your product unless you have a sales funnel. So secret number one you guys have to understand is understanding marketing math. Now I'm not amazing at marketing, but there's a couple numbers you have to understand how they work. When you understand them it becomes really easy, okay? These are the two numbers. The first number is called CPA, cost per acquisition. This is how much you are spending to get a customer. So I give Mark Zuckerberg some money. He's like, sweet man, thanks for the money. He then shows my ad on Facebook and if my ad's good, then I get a customer back in exchange. The second number is average cart value. How much money do you make inside of the cart on average when somebody comes into your funnel? So I clicked on the ad, here's the funnel. I'm gonna go through page one, page two, and then there's all these things. And they're not gonna buy all the stuff. I wish they would, that'd be amazing. But they're gonna buy maybe the first thing, maybe I'll sell number one or two, and they're gonna buy some things. So on average of all the customers that go through this funnel, how much money on average do I make when they come out the other side? When they come out with the product, okay? And that's the game. That's how the marketing math works. Okay, now if I put a dollar in and I get $1 back out, I didn't lose any money, but I didn't really make any money. This is where I'm like, okay, it's not scaling it. This is where the funnel audible's coming. Like what do I need to tweak? What do I need to change? What are the things I need to do to make sure this is gonna be successful? Okay, and if I put $2 in and I get $1 back out, that's the sign that you should stop buying ads. Secret number two, finding the control. Now I want you guys to understand, if you look at the direct response industry, like companies like Agora, so what they'll do is they have an offer. They have something they're gonna sell, and they'll have five different copywriters write a different sales letter for the offer. Okay, and the reason why they're trying to find out whose sales letter, whose copy is gonna be the best. Right, and this set works. I've got a lot of friends that write for Agora. So they'll have, here's the product, five different people write and copy. They send out the ads for all different fives, and they find out which one of these five is the one that's gonna win. Okay, so they do the test, and all of a sudden this copywriter wins. So if that copywriter is the winner, it means that person is the control. This is the ad that's working the best. They get rid of all the rest of them, and all of the royalties go to that copywriter. Okay, now the next phase they do is, then they take the control. This is the one that's working the best, and then they have all five copywriters. They say, okay, here's the control. Each of you guys rewrite the intro and see if you can beat it. And so each person's got a shot to try to rewrite the intro, and they start sending it out and see if they can beat the last control. And if they can beat the control, then that copywriter gets the money. For us as funnel hackers, our goal is similar, so for us to pay a whole bunch of copywriters to write the control, we're trying to find out what funnel is most likely to succeed for the thing I'm trying to sell. Okay, so a lot of you have heard this story before, but when I was launching NURSEL, my first supplement, the first question was like, okay, how am I gonna sell this thing? Like, what am I gonna do? Like, what should I, what should page one be? What should my video be? Like, my first step was like, what is the control? What is the thing that's currently working the best to sell supplements? I gotta figure that out. Okay, because there's a control. So I started going out there and looking at every single supplement company, and I started buying their products to see what was happening. Step one, what did they do? Step two, I started studying. This is me doing my homework, right? This is the Marine D3 offer that I went through their offer. And they had a VSL, and then order formed one, three, and four bottles. They had upsells selling six more bottles of the same thing. And they had their offer number two and offer number three. And so that was the structure. At the time, this funnel was doing, I think, $3 million a month. So I knew that if I was gonna build a supplement, this was the control. This was currently working the best today. So I'm not gonna go and reinvent the wheel and guess. I'm gonna funnel hack that. So okay, this is what I need to create, and that becomes the control. Take that control, I doodle out. Here's what I need to build. I'll log in and click funnels, and I build out my version of that, right? Step number four now, cost per acquisition. How do we get the cost per acquisition lower? Dean and I were having a race trying to see who could sell more of our books. And at first we were like, neck to neck. And then something happened, he started selling way more books than us. And after two, three hours digging through all the metrics and numbers, we realized that the difference between our campaigns and Dean's campaigns is that Dean was creating way more ads than us. And I was like, how many ads are you creating? He's like, oh, a couple a day. I was like, a couple a day. I'm like, I do like once or twice every couple months, maybe. He said, no, we do a couple, I do a lot of them. He said, the interesting thing, he said, with Facebook and Instagram and TikTok and YouTube and all different things like that, he said the ads don't last 18 months. He's like, they last closer to like 18 days. So the next question is like, what kind of creative, like what ads should I make? I don't even know how to make ads. Russell, there's a million different options. Like, how do I do it? I was hanging out with Travis, who was the owner of Chamber Media, and he developed a software he calls the brain. And he said that the brain, they started using the software and said they went from 50% of the ads they made for the clients working to over 80% by understanding what ads work the best. And they literally went, scraped Facebook, scraped Instagram, scraped all these things and looked at tens of thousands of different ads and found that all the ads that were working consistently over time, all fit into one of seven different categories. I'm trying to figure out what kind of ads should I make? Right, most of us are like, I don't know what kind of ad to make. Let me just get my phone out and make an ad real quick, right? This gave us a process like, okay, let's keep testing these things and move throughout. Okay, so an example, this is a spokesperson ad. So we guys have seen with the Harmon Brothers, we did a lot of these, we hired an expensive spokesperson, they did it. Sometimes I was a spokesperson and the high production ones are amazing, but they're also really, really expensive. You can also do ones that are really simple. So this is an example of one we did. We wrote a script. We hired an actress for $400. She read the script, we put some video overlays and 400 bucks, this ad was out the door and this one actually is beating a lot of ones we spent literally hundreds of thousands of dollars on. So I'll show you guys this first like 10 seconds so you can get an idea of how it works. Stop, entrepreneurs and small business owners. I'm about to show you a weird, almost backwards, funnel secret that is currently being used by an underground group of entrepreneurs to sell almost anything online. I'll keep going, but that was an example of a spokesperson, right? Very simple, very easy to do. And again, you can be the spokesperson, you can hire a spokesperson. It's really cool. Number two, product demo. And there's a lot of ways. Everyone's product's different. This is how we demoed a book, right? It's simple like just flipping through the pages or taking the Kindle eBook version, just scrolling through both these ads that are really, really well-forced. So what if we demo it like actually showing a funnel and you get Coke and you put a Mentos in it and try to spray the Coke and see how much follows the bottle without a funnel and then do it a second time with an actual funnel. And so we made this video, which was really dorky and fun. It's really hard to get Coke in the top of a little bottle, just like it's hard to get customers to buy your product unless you have something awesome, which we like to call a sales funnel. Oh! And so we demoed a concept that was in a book that sells dot com secrets and sells funnels. Number three, social proof. Getting other people who have success to your product, filming it, testimonials, things like that. Closer ads, these are obviously, typically use most for retargeting ads. So this one, we're an arcade, I had my book, I was like, great phone, we're gonna record a closing ad real quick. And so this is for somebody who came to the dot com secret site, didn't buy the book and left, they would see this ad following them for the next week or so. Lifestyle business. Now mostly when the lifestyle things in my industry are like them in a Ferrari or them in an airplane or whatever, I like lifestyle videos that are more simple. This is Eric, Thane and his wife, and this is an example of an ad, is them opening a two comic book box, just kind of showing them and their lifestyle inside of their home. It's Eric, Eric Thane. We are opening the two comic club award, we got it, the big box. Box. I've been thinking about this for a long time. Here we go, I hope I don't scratch it. Ooh, well here it is, let's do it. Here we go. Woo! Here it is, the two comic book award. I'll let the camera see it first. Wow, Eric Thane, Cinema Mastery. 2019, last year. I love to see you guys unboxing videos. Please keep sending those as they come in, like they're my favorite watch. Okay, but lifestyle, so how do you show lifestyle on an ad? Unboxing, this was the harder one in my industry because most of our stuff is digital, so I'm like how do we do an unboxing funnel? And so this is how we do an award. I wanna recommend you guys start going out and seeing ads on Facebook or YouTube, start looking at those things, start categorizing them in different categories. This is another interesting thing, Chamber of Media, from the brain, is they found these are the average time lengths of the videos that are the most successful. Which is kind of encouraging, because most of them are 25 seconds, 30 seconds, but these aren't long form ads. The ones that are most successful, the short form, they're fast, but they're not that long, so they're not that long, so they're not that long. So, I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys what I'm gonna do next. I'm gonna show you guys what I'm gonna do next. So, again, I recommend, look at those seven categories. Next time you're on Facebook or whatever, start looking like, oh, that's lifestyle, that, oh, that's case study, and then you start doing that and categorizing things, it'll give you ideas of how you can do that in your business as well. After we've got all these things in place, now we need to let the market vote with their credit cards. Too often we get into our heads like, oh, I think people are gonna buy this, I think people are gonna buy this. When people ask me, like, we look at my funnel and let me know if it's like, if I should test anything, I'm like, first question I ask is, have you tested it? If you're driven by traffic, it's like, no, I want your opinion first. Like, I don't wanna give you my opinion first, cause I might mess this whole thing up. I have no idea if it's gonna work or not work. The only people's opinion that matters is your customers. So we take our control, we take the thing we create, the best possible thing we have, right? Okay, so if I have a webinar that's selling a $1,000 product, I'm gonna test $1,000 on my first test to go through the webinar funnel. If I get one person to buy it and I break even, it's like, sweet, this is awesome. Okay, if this is a book funnel and someone goes through it, they were to buy everything, let's say my average potential card value is $300, I would invest $300 to add to see if the funnel's gonna work. And I'm gonna put $300 in and see at the end of it, did I make 300 bucks? If not, then I'm gonna go back and start tweaking things. Number one is the ad, okay? I look at the ad, like did it do well, did it not do well? If the CPA is lower than the average card value, then that one's good. Cool, I don't need to worry about the ad. Then it goes to the landing page. Okay, I'm looking, what is the percent conversion? This one I wrote, it's 41%, okay? That means the EPC is probably gonna be pretty high, it means it's doing well. When I consult people, I have the drive traffic through the funnel, then they come back and say, show me the numbers. I wanna see numbers on the ad, the landing page, every single page inside the funnel. I look at those numbers and now we can diagnose things. Okay, the way we always fix all the problems in every single page in this funnel comes back to something we talked about two funnel hacking labs ago, which is the hook, the story, or the offer. One of those three things is the thing that's broken every single time, 100%. And the last one here is funnel stacking. Okay, this said get true market domination. Again, we'll come back to Dan Kennedy. Dan Kennedy said, ultimately the business that can spend the most money to acquire customer wins. Most of you, as if you've had a business that's focused on just one funnel, you got one funnel, that's where everything's happening. As the ad costs and things have changed over the last three or four months and costs have gone up, it's gonna be harder and harder to win. Okay, I've seen people who are good entrepreneurs who are struggling now because they were making all their money in one funnel, and now that funnel's not as profitable as it used to be because of the ad cost and everything's shifting. And so we start looking at funnel stacking. Funnel stacking is saying, okay, well I have a funnel that I'm selling this first product, but maybe it's the break-even funnel. Maybe I only break even. Maybe I even lose a little bit of money selling my first product, but then I acquire a customer, and then I take them to the next funnel, which is I sell the next product in my value ladder, and then the next product, and the next product. And for me, this is the self-play game. It's very simple. It's like, now we got a funnel to work, how do we stack the next funnel, and the next funnel and keep them in forward? And that is how a funnel is all about, we're working, guys.
