ClickFunnels 2.0, how are we gonna launch this thing? Two years ago we started building it. A year ago we told the world about it. Right now expectations are high, people are going crazy, demands insane, people wanting this and that. The most chaotic, stressful, tiring, emotional roller coaster week of my entire life. How do we do it? How do we execute it? How do we launch it? I'm gonna tell you on today's episode. Yeah, there's a lot. You're listening to Marketing Secrets with your host, Russell Brunson. Okay, today we're gonna talk about your first funnel challenge, which was the relaunch of ClickFunnels 2.0. You saw any of these ads like this. Can I let you in on a little secret? If I did invest, wanna know the first thing I would do? I'd build a funnel. You may have seen the actual funnels. Someone walk you guys behind the scenes, what it is, how it worked, why we did it this way, and some of the results of when we launched ClickFunnels 2.0. We had been working on ClickFunnels 2.0 for two years and it's like, how do we bring this into the world? Now the obvious answer is we need to use a funnel because we know that, right? But which one? A funnel is like a tool. There's so many of them, right? And we're good at all the tools. Like I'm really good at webinars, really good at product launch, really good at challenges, really good at book funnels. You know, like whatever it is, like we can do them all, but it's like, what's the tool that's gonna be most useful for us to launch 2.0? So that was the question. Not only like, were we trying to launch a funnel to launch 2.0, it's like, we're still trying to build 2.0. We're eight years into 1.0 and you're still fixing things and tweaking things and stuff. And so 2.0 is like this massive undertaking, which is, you know, the software is 10x what ClickFunnels 1.0 is, right? In 2.0, it's like you scroll down, you find the funnels tab and it's like, oh, here's funnels. And that's the one thing that it does, which is all of ClickFunnels 1.0, but 2.0 does everything else. It has websites and shopping carts and stores and blogs and like it does all the different things, right? And so we're trying to get all these things done as quick as we can to be able to launch. If you've launched anything and this is true with like info products, but even more so softwares, like as you get closer and closer to launch, there's things like, this isn't gonna be done. This isn't gonna be done. So you have to make these decisions. Like we're not gonna do this, we're not gonna do this. Like whatever those things might be, right? And so just knowing as we're going through this, those are these two things we're juggling. It's just like we have this product we'll be working on for the next two decades of our life. At some point it needs to go live. At some point we have to launch it. And like when is that? And how do we get it where it's good enough that people can start coming in? And then, you know, it's also the same thing as like when you test something yourself a million different times, as soon as you get, you know, 16,932 people to sign up in a week for it, they're gonna find a lot more bugs that we couldn't find on our own, right? And how do you handle that? And so there's a lot behind this. And so I wanna tell you guys, I think we're gonna share everything. It all started with realizing the type of funnel we wanted to use for the launch 2.0 was a challenge funnel. We've done a couple of little challenges, never one that was like really big scale before. A couple months prior to our launch, Dean Grasio, St. Tony Robbins did their big challenge. And so we participated in that. We were one of the top five affiliates. Again, like I think every year they've ever done it. For a lot of reasons, one, you know, you make good money. Number two, you get to go hang out with Tony Robbins. But also I wanted to be able to see at a deep level behind the scenes of what they did and why they did it so I can understand it. And I knew that we were gonna use a similar model to launch ClickFunnels 2.0. So the next question, like what's the hook gonna be? This one, this was a painful one for me because it shipped it a lot. Initially we're like, what's the big premise of ClickFunnels? Like the fact that you can bootstrap a company. You don't need VC money and things like that, right? Like this year, Funnel I Can I, we did the Bootstrapped Entrepreneur of the Year Award, right? Like I bought Bootstrap.com. I'm writing a book called Bootstrap to tell the ClickFunnels story. Like I just knew like that was the hook, like Bootstrap, that's gonna be the hook that we're gonna use, right? And as we started talking about though, we realized that most small entrepreneurs, like new entrepreneurs coming into the world, they don't really relate to bootstrapping the way that traditional people are, right? If you think about bootstrapping, what is it that a small entrepreneur coming into our world think about? I was like, well, the thing they think about is shark tank. That's closer, they think like, oh, if I get a good idea, I go on shark tank and pitch and get some money to fund this business. So I was like, okay, bootstrapping, but like the shark tank angle is the most interesting. Now, most of the sharks actually use ClickFunnels for some of their businesses. And so we have good relationships with a bunch of them, but there's one specifically who is like, probably one of the biggest proponents of ClickFunnels and that's Damon John. It's funny, me and Damon have spoken at different events. In fact, at 10X in Vegas, where we set the world record for most sales ever from stage, I spoke, Damon spoke right afterwards, but we didn't see each other and we spoke somewhere else. Like we crossed paths, but we never actually had met. And so, but we talked on social a couple of times. And so I thought, man, he'd be a really cool person to have. And one of the guys on his team told us, they said like, when we do shark tank deals, if the product we're buying, if it makes sense to do with ClickFunnels, we build in ClickFunnels and launch it over there. And so I thought of this really funny hook. I was like, what if the hook was basically the shark, right? Damon John, who's, you know, he's like the vision of like what bootstrapping looks like on small entrepreneurs. Like I'm gonna come to a shark, he's gonna be money, we're gonna launch this company together, right? And what if Damon, you came to Damon like, hey, will you find my company? You know, like will you invest in my company? And Damon's like, we got two options. Number one, like I can invest in your company, but I'm just gonna go open a ClickFunnels account and launch it and take half your company, or you could just open a ClickFunnels account and launch it yourself, right? And so I was kind of premised by message. I'm like, hey, I had this idea for a hook that'd be kind of funny, would you be interested in doing this or just kind of out of bounds? I was nervous just to ask him anyway, but I asked him and he rolled back, he's like, actually that's pretty cool. Hit my manager and let's figure it out. So I was like, oh my gosh, he's cool with it. Like, ah, this is so cool. And so that began. And so initially it was gonna be called the Bootstrap Challenge. And we were gonna talk about a Bootstrap for your company, but you Bootstrap it instead of Bootstrap it with a shark, you Bootstrap it with a funnel. And so we started moving forward towards that. We wrote scripts towards that. We had Damon on calls and we mapped out what it was gonna do and what the scripts are gonna be and how, you know, and he was bought off on everything. The point was like, scripts were locked, everything was good and then we're supposed to go film, fly down and film all the videos with him. And then fast forward to my mastermind. So I'm with my category Kings, which is one of the groups, my inner circle, where Pirates Code, so we guys know Berry Bomb Gardener. She's the one who runs Funlacking Live, runs our virtual, runs our events. She runs events for most people, for Tony Robbins, for everybody, right? And she was kind of behind the scenes, running Tony and Dean's launch. And one thing she said was interesting, as we were talking on day number one of Pirates Code, she was like, before Tony and Dean launched, I think they tested like 10 different titles through ads. And she said, the titles that outconvert or were the titles were like an action. So if you look at Tony's, it's like own your future challenge. Like it's like an action where like, you're gonna own your future, right? If you notice any Deans or Tonys are always based on something like that. And it's the test of a bunch and that was what worked the best was something like own your future. I was like, ours, ours is the Bootstrap. Bootstrap challenge, which is like a more like a noun, right? It's like, oh, it's just the thing. I was like, we have to, we have to come with a different name. And I couldn't think what it was. And I sat there for three days in Pirates Code, stressing out about this. Cause I knew like, if I make this change, everyone's gonna want to kill me, especially Dan who's sitting right there. Cause he's like, I wrote the scripts, we got everything locked. Like I have a plan. And towards the end of that week, I was like, I think for this to work, we have to change it. And my thought was like, it's almost so simple. It's like your first funnel challenge, own your future challenge, your first funnel challenge, like it's action, something that are working towards, right? Bootstrap, you're not working towards, it's just a thing versus your first funnel, it's something you're working towards. Oh, I'm gonna get my first funnel done, right? And then it was cool as like, then I was like, the MIFKI is your first funnel challenge box. And so it was like, there's congruency between the landing page message and hook, hook story offer. And then the thank you page hook story offer. And so I kind of called it audible, but we did it. And we made that shift. And then we went back to Damon, John, right? Hey, we're still doing the bootstrap. But kind of bootstrap is like the secondary message, like your first funnel challenge, like it became like the still the same message, but kind of like, we had to like shift it a little bit to make it fit into this new kind of framework that we were doing. In the process, whole thing, we flew the entire team out. So copywriters, funnel builders, designers, programmers, like everybody, we flew them here to Boise because we had to figure out how to coordinate because it's not just a funnel, right? There's the challenge funnel. There's like emails that go to it. There's the ads that go to it, right? The copy, the creative, the ads from there. There's a whole bunch of steps that go into building this or any funnel. And it was fun because we had a chance, you know, we have a remote team. We have like around 400 plus employees and contractors around the world of work for ClickFunnels. And we have an office at Boise and office in Atlanta and they're both small offices. And so what's cool about this is everyone had a chance to fly from all around the world wherever they were at, fly to be in office at Boise. And so we can sit there and have, you know, what Tony Robbins says, proximity is power. We had a chance to be around each other as we were talking and thinking and brainstorming. Like what's the hook? What's the angle? What's the sequence need to be? What are the emails you say? Like what do we need to create so we can have these things in place? We made those decisions and it was off the races. We're jumping in a plane. We're flying to LA to go film with Damon John. I mean, come on, like Damon John, he's way cooler than me or you combined. Like he is like one of the coolest people all time, right? It's like we ran like one of those big sound, stitch, stage warehouses with green screens and white screens and all sorts of stuff with all these scripts and teleprompters and all this stuff. And like I get there before he got there. So like I'm seeing things, everything. It was waiting for him to show up and waiting and waiting. And also like, all right, Damon's in the building. And like, oh man. And so the first time I ever met him in person, so went over there and it was just like, I don't know, I'm always awkward, especially like first time meeting people. What's up man? How's it going? What's going on? How are you doing? Good, good to see you. What's happening guys? They're speaking part of our project. Yeah, I know, my pleasure. Excuse me. Anyway, I was true to form, very awkward. But we met and he's like, so what are we doing today? I'm like, well, you've seen the script, right? Like we're doing that. He's like, oh yeah, whatever. And he was just, he was really cool. He was fun to work with. We got out there, got him all dressed up, went out there and a whole bunch of the first ones are just him to camera, right? So we had lines and scripts and he's reading them and doing the things and it was just kind of fun watching him. And but then back in the mind, I was stressing out sitting back, so I was like, I know that me and him and a whole bunch of ads were filming together. And some of the ads, I don't know if we've gotten him completely approved through him. And I was like, what if he doesn't want to say him? You know, he's making fun of himself and these things. And we're like, is he gonna be okay with that? Is he gonna, you know? And so he filmed all the ones he did first. And then I was like, can I meet him? I have to go out there. And the other thing that stressed me out was like, Damon John is like, he's Damon John. He's like the founder of Fubu. Like one of the best dressed people in the world. Like I'm a T-shirt jeans guy who dresses once a year for Funnel Hacking Live. So I'm trying to like dress where I'm not a student tie, but I'm like the cool like internet nerd version of that. So got all dressed up and then it was me and him on camera together. Anyway, it was, it was hard, but we did it. And we kept going back and forth. And eventually we got all the lines in all the scripts done. And there was like this one that like, hey, we have another script we wrote. Just want to see if you're okay with it. So it put possibly teleprompter and David's reading. He's like, he's like, oh, seriously? You guys are gonna like, all right, whatever. Let's do it. And we're like, oh, and like, anyway, we're so excited. But I was like so stressed like he's gonna hate me when this is all over. And from that, we got all these amazing ads for the registration page, for the ads, for the retargeting ads for like all the stuff around this challenge with Damon by himself, with me and Damon together. And then the end of it is basically, we wanted Damon to present at the challenge, but again, with timing and stuff was just difficult. So we decided to film his, his session of the challenge as an interview while we were there. So sent some couches, got all the lights perfect. And then I had a chance to actually interview him there at the end of that crazy day. And the whole thing was, it was just, one of the things where it's like, your nerves are high, anxiety is stressful. You're moving a million miles a minute, you're having a lot of fun. You're meeting like somebody who looked up to you for your whole life. And like just all the things, all the anxiety, by the time it was done, I was just wrecked. And as fast as it all started, it was gone. And he took off and he was onto the next, Damon John thing, who knows what he was doing. And that was kind of the end of it. And it was, it was amazing. And then we had a fast four back and Dan and his team was editing all the videos as fast as they could because we're like a week away from the challenge now for the launching of it. And then we're coordinating with the speakers and like the curriculum. And honestly, like it was tough because even like what I was going to teach kept changing and shifting and changing and shifting even the week before the launch. Like I think on Wednesday or Thursday before the training started, like I was shifting it again and like moving where the speakers were at. When all of a sudden done, we had it mapped out where it's like, it was perfect. After finally hard coding, I did hard coding and the speakers getting it all done. Traffic was going, launches were going. We started getting a lot of leads. And so I'm going to go through just a couple of numbers real quick. From the promotion, we had 221,101 people registered for the challenge during the promotional thing, which is amazing. So we had 16,932 people who signed up for ClickFunnels 2.0 on the thank you page, which is pretty amazing. And so that's kind of step in one before the event ever happened, right? And then what happens is then everyone gets in there, date number one happens and we do the training. The training went, went awesome. And then we had two guest speakers who spoke afterwards. And then at the end of that, we made a pitch for people who weren't VIP because basically, hey, if you're a VIP member, first off, you get ClickFunnels trial for 30 days for free. And number two, you're going to be on these live Zoom calls with speakers. So we did a pitch right then, right after, after day number one training. And I think from there, I can't remember exact numbers, but it was like another thousand, 2000 people or so went and signed up for VIP and got ClickFunnels trials at the end of day number one because they wanted to be in the VIP training happening afterwards, which was amazing. The biggest headache we had is having almost $17 people join ClickFunnels 2.0 in one day, you know, in a couple of days and then day number one, giving them all homework assignment and all 17,000 people logging into ClickFunnels and doing that homework. And we had all sorts of issues with the software crash and the templates not working and the themes and like, if I give it to everybody, we started finding out what the mistakes were very, very quickly. And so it was tough. And in the Facebook group, it turned into this negative thing. If I got logged in and it's crashing, I can't get my log in and it was all encompassing. All night long, like I was in the Facebook group, I think for five or six hours, like responding questions, getting things, sending it to the dev team and like going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. I went to bed that night, like just in tears, I wanted to cancel the entire event, cancel 2.0, our Russell's gonna run away and just be done. And I decided on day number two, like I needed to reframe this cause like we're losing the audience, we're losing everybody. So we got 221,000 people and it's just chaos right now. Right? And so day number two, I started by changing people's attitudes and I did a big reframe that went really, really well. And it was crazy as my two guest speaker, they two were Garrett White and Annie Grace and Annie went first and she gave an amazing presentation, she also kind of like reshifted people's perception, helping them understand like how big this mission is and what each person individually is called to do and like focusing on that. And it was amazing that Garrett came in and you know, Garrett just yells a lot and he did a good job though. I got him to not drop a single F bomb the entire time, which was amazing. There's only one reason they bring me around here, one simple reason, fire. Today I get to do it with no language, which means I get to use all the fire with no f***s. But he also had people like take accountability, like yes, software's being worked on, things are like we're fixing bugs as fast as possible, but quit trying to figure out ways to like prove this wrong, like take ownership, like this is your life, this is your future, like get in there and like just do the things. And they're like, you know, if it doesn't work out, it's okay, like just keep working on it. It's gonna, like we're here for you, right? And by day number two, it shifted. Like the tone in the Facebook group went positive. Everyone was excited, everyone was like, it just, it shifted everything in a powerful, fast thing. And from that point forward, the rest of the event was amazing. Day number three training went great. Day number four, the stack in the clothes, the guest speakers, everything was perfect. Day number five, we did the logical repitch and then there we had a chance to watch the video interviewed Dana John. And that was the first five days of the challenge. And after the five day challenge, we decided to do this bonus live event day, which was kind of crazy where Jenna Kutcher was gonna speak and Grant Cardone was gonna speak and Myron Golden and like all these like huge speakers were flying in for this last day. It was almost like having a mini FHL at the end of this thing. Like it was like the most chaotic, stressful, tiring, emotional roller coaster week of my entire life. So much chaos. And so anyway, next day starts, I kick it off. Jenna comes in and Jenna, I mean, she's amazing. She does her stuff. It was amazing. Grant comes in the backstage and we're outside before he gets on and asks a couple of questions. And then he's like, hey, you're gonna interview me. And so I jump on stage and bring him in, which are interviewing him. And it was crazy. Like I've always liked Grant Cardone. I love Grant Cardone. Like he stepped up and delivered for us in a way that was amazing. His presentation was, it was powerful. It was funny. It was hilarious. That day was amazing. We did a repitch at the end, sold a whole bunch more people into it. It was so tiring. That night I've been laying in bed. I was like, I cannot believe we did this. Now, obviously the desk to settle a little bit. I looked at the stats yesterday to kind of get an update. And of the 16, 17,000 people who joined ClickFunnels 2.0 during that time, obviously there's gonna be attrition and cancellations and churn and all those kinds of things. But even right now we have over 10,000 people that came in during that segment during the challenge. We're still active ClickFunnels 2.0 members, which is amazing. It's what we did year number one at ClickFunnels the entire year. We were able to do that in a week, which is a cool way to kind of kick off the ClickFunnels 2.0. And we have so many updates over this year. I'm gonna show you updates of all the things we're doing because I know a lot of you guys are curious. What are all the things you're doing to grow your SaaS company? But the big beginning part was this. It was kind of like the launchpad to get it into the world. It's been a lot of stress, a lot of headaches, a lot of work. But it's also like the fruits of now it's done. We were talking about building ClickFunnels 2.0 for two years. We worked on the launch for six months. We did the launch over a six, seven day period of time. And now it's a month or two later. It's like, oh, it worked. Like it's out there in the world. Like our vision, our dream is now being used by tens of thousands of people around the world and just continue to grow every single day. So that's some of the stories behind the year first funnel challenge launch. How we got ClickFunnels 2.0 into orbit. And I hope you guys enjoy this episode.
