## Transcript
You know, you hear these stories of like the waitress that, you know, someone wrote a check to pay for their college education, or you hear those things, you never ever think that that would happen to you. I just got done with one of my favorite interviews ever, and you guys are going to love this. I had decided that I needed a promo video. It was like $7,000. And at that time, there's no way I could come up with $7,000. If I just say, all right, God, you know, this is up to you. Like, I'm just going to let you do with the money stuff. I'm just going to do what I know how to do. You know, I'm going to hire the videographer, I'm going to hire. I rented out the studio. Someone's been our inner circle last, man, three plus years. And it's one of my favorite people in our community. And that day I get a message on my space. I would love to make a donation and he pulls out a checkbook. He said, you never have to talk to me again. You owe me nothing. And he writes something down and he closes it and he hands it to me. Just a really fascinating interview. So I like, I grabbed the check and I like, open it up. And it's a check for $10,000. Complete Transform for Life. And she creates really funny ads. As you'll see, one of her ads got over 60 million views. I never would have guessed that within 24 hours I would have, you know, more than what I needed, especially in such a large amount of money. And I cannot wait to share this interview with you guys about how to launch and grow your company with funny ads. Our special guest for today is Christine Morel. And I'm so excited to have her here. So how are you doing today? Thanks, Russell. I'm doing great. How are you? I'm doing so good. And maybe we actually do. Let's start again, just the beginning story with the first kind of funny ad that you did that kind of took off and then I want to go deeper into some of the some of the backstory. But what was the very first, the very first kind of situation, take people to the situation you were in when you created the first ad that took off? Yeah, yeah. So I was living on a farm, basically in New Mexico, and I had no Wi-Fi. And I was like, just figuring out how am I going to promote my products? How am I going to sell my products? One was by this was like, this was 2009. It was right when COVID hit. OK. So I had moved to New Mexico. I just had a baby. I needed help. I moved in with my parents, you know. And and then I looked outside and I always tell everyone, we had this like old toilet in our backyard. And we even had like washers and dryers and all kinds of other stuff. But like, we're Mexican and like, I always joke with everyone. I'm like, you know, Mexicans, we do all of our own plumbing. We do all of our own landscaping. We do everything. So there's always like just stuff everywhere. So there's just like old toilet because we had like redone my mom's bath. Bathroom. It's left outside. It's just left it outside. Like, where else are you going to put it? You don't throw it away. Leave it in the backyard. That's what we do. Maybe we'll need it later, you know. And so then I asked my dad and my brother, like, hey, can you move it into the to the middle of the field? And my mom had like this old horse there, like a rocking horse type thing. And then we had like this book and some oranges. And I was like, and my brother was there and I was like, oh, maybe we could shoot an end. And then what I've actually never shared with you is we were under there was tornadoes. So just like across the street from us, like in the other field, there were like three tornadoes. And like so in the middle of a shooting this out, I had like minutes because there was like a gigantic tornado coming after us. But I was like, I got to make money to feed my baby. So I we just I got my brother to sit on the toilet. And I just said, hey, you're probably on the toilet right now because I figured some people are going to be on their phone and they're on their toilet. And I'm like, how funny it would be if you got called out and said, you're probably on the toilet, but you should be promoting your music, you know. And so that's why I did. I had a music offer and we just shot that. And my brother just sat there on the toilet and, you know, I called him Harry and he had an accent. And it was just it was absolutely ridiculous. And it got like millions of views. And I wasn't expecting that. And I didn't know it. And then all of a sudden everyone's like, this is the best ad ever. And I was like, oh, everyone has really weird sense of humor. You know, we'll just we'll run with this. So that was the that was the first ad. That was the first one. Can we play it real quick? Yeah. Oh, my God. Here's the ad. Hey, artists and musicians, I know a lot of you guys are at home right now doing nothing, trying to figure out what to do with your time, not promoting your music. Maybe writing plastic courses like this one, or maybe you've learned how to juggle or maybe you've learned a new language. A lot of you may have even started your own lawn-blowing music, but none of that matters if you're not promoting your music. See, a lot of you guys are like Harry over here. Say hello, Harry. How do y'all? How long have you been sitting there, Harry? 25 minutes. A lot of you guys that are watching right now are doing the exact same thing that Harry is doing. Ain't that the truth, Christine Morel? You can call me Christine. All right, Christine Morel. Now, instead of wasting time doing stuff like this, you could have already submitted your music to 4,592 blogs and magazines and Spotify playlists that all play music and publish music from independent artists like yourself. And in fact, I put together a list of 4,592 of them. And if you get just one of these blogs to publish your music, you'll potentially reach hundreds, two thousands of listeners overnight. So if you're an artist that wants to get your music out there, don't be like Harry. Check the description, click on the link and let's get your music out there. All right, that's amazing. So I want to go deeper into that because now you've turned this into a whole business and you've done it for me and for other people and it's so fascinating. But I want to tell a story that probably I bet most people don't know this about you. In fact, I didn't know we had a chance to go to Wise Virginia together to the Neapoli Hill Foundation. And at dinner, we're sitting and talking and it's your origin story, how you learned how to sell and do these things was so cool because I obviously I spent two years on a mission knocking doors like selling religion for the most part. And yours was the same thing. You were knocking doors. So we tell us that story how because you're a musician, you're creating music, but you didn't have a, you know, someone who was selling it. Like you were out there knocking doors like tell us about how that started. Yeah. So I started when I was 10, actually. So when I was 10 years old, we were like the like the little Mexican family. And then my friend had a her dad actually had a was a dentist. And so I went into her neighborhood and I was like, Oh, these rich people live here. They all have money. Let me sell them something. You know. And so like, what could we sell? And she had a iced cappuccino machine. She's like, let's make iced cappuccino. I didn't even know what that like, what's a cappuccino? I don't even know what that is. Right. And so we made these little cappuccinos and she had these little plastic things. And then we took GAC. I know this is so bad. This was so unethical. We're 10. So this is not like recently we took GAC. I've never even told the story and we put it in water and then we're like, we're just going to call this makeup remover. And so then we put that into like these plastic bottles. And I just remember taking paper and like writing makeup remover on it. So we had ice cappuccinos and makeup remover. And then we go door to door and like within an hour, I walk away with like $75, right? I'm 10. $75 is like, I'm balling like I am balling. And so we go back home and then her mom gets so angry with her and she makes her go, you know, give all the money back. I kept my money. I was like, I don't know about you. I'm keeping my money. It's $75. That's a lot. So she had to go give it back. But that was for me, that was the first lesson in create something and then go find the people to sell it to, you know? And so whenever I just kind of continued selling all kinds of random things. I used to go to the dollar store and I used to actually negotiate with the dollar store. So they'd give me everything for about 55 cents and then I'd go sell everything for $5. So then I went door to door selling like little candles and stuff. How old were you when you were doing that? Oh, 10. I did, I did door to door sales until I was like 23. That's crazy. Yeah. So I'm just selling anything that I could find. One of the best things, which I don't even know, I don't know if this is even good. Maybe it's not best. Maybe it's totally bad. Would I buy one thing? So here's the, this is so terrible. So I'd buy like a clock because then I'd go to family dollar and then I'd go by raffle tickets because then I realized I could buy one clock and sell as many raffle tickets as I want, you know, and then I wouldn't even give them a date. I'd be like, I just have a clock. I'm going to give this away. So it was like a never ending like place. And then eventually at some point, I'd be $2,000 in raffle tickets for $12. It was so bad, but it was like, you just create something and you get in front of people. And then when I started making music, that's when it was like, okay, I've just already done this already. Let me just go directly to the people. And so I used to create albums, would burn them on my CDs back in, when we would burn them and make copies and write in Sharpie, you know, Christine's music. And then I would go door to door and I would just, you know, hey, you know, I mean, you know how it is. I mean, it'd be 120 degrees and a pouring sweat or it'd be like freezing cold, you know, so cold that I could barely move and just ask me, but hey, would you be interested in buying my music? Hey, if I'm a musician, that's what I'm doing. Telling me a little bit, kind of like hook story offer, I guess, you know, here's a little bit of my story, here's my offer and seeing if they're interested. And I did that tell, I was like, yeah, like 23 years old. When did you start selling it? When did you first see you sold? I was about 17 years old. So, and I sold thousands of albums that way. And it was about, it was like, I always tell everyone, it was like a 90% failure rate, like nine out of 10, people said no, you know, I'm sure people were like slamming the door. I mean, I remember people would come to our door, like the Jehovah's Witnesses and we would all hide in the bathroom. So we'd be like, shh, shh, everybody hide in it. When you're singing that knock and noise, like, I can hear you in there. You're like, quiet, quiet. Yeah, yeah, that's what I meant. I would put us all in the bathroom and be like, yeah. So like, I already knew, you know, I already knew, like people aren't happy when you're knocking on their door. So I was just kind of already expecting of it. But yes, I was 17 and then I, like nine out of 10 people said no, but one out of 10 people would say yes, or I'd meet like a really cool family that would be like, I'll buy all your CDs or come inside and have dinner with us. And I was like, I'd sleep on people's couches and I was living in Motel Sixes or whatever, you know, however I was surviving. And occasionally someone would say, we have an extra room, you know, you could stay here for the weekend. And so I met all these really nice people. And then there was all kinds of crazy stories too, which I guess we can get into. But, but it was like nine out of 10 people, you know, slamming doors in my face, telling me go get a real job or, you know, real kind of mean people. And then there'd be one person that's just like, hey, come have dinner and we'll pray for you. And their family would gather around and pray, you know, so it was like, wow, this is, I'm just, you get used to rejection really fast. And I think that's a huge superpower of you just, yeah, for entrepreneurship because you're just okay. You said, no, okay, next. No, okay, next. No, it's such a big thing for me too. It's like, because when we knock, I was knocking doors in Jersey and like, you know, for us it was one out of 10, it was like one out of a hundred maybe it was nice to, but it's like, no, no, no, slam the door. We had people like let their dogs out on us. Like, you know, I'm like, you were jumping over the fence while dogs are biting at it. You know, like, it was chaos, but yeah, you learned that like, they're not rejecting me, they're rejecting the message, which is fine. And then just keep going. Okay, so I'm curious, do you remember your door approach? Like how you did it? Yeah. Yeah. So pitch me right now. I'm gonna knock on the knock on my door and pitch it to me. Okay. If you open the door and you didn't yell at me first, how are you doing? Hi, my name is Christine Morel. I'm a singer. I'm here. A lot of times I was like, maybe getting ready for an album or something. So I'd be like, I, um, I've just put together a new album and I just wanted to see if you'd be interested in checking it out. And you could even take a listen if you like. And if you like it, it's $10 and just wanted to see if you'd be interested in supporting a local artist. So something kind of just like that, really simple. And then sometimes they would ask me to sing. So I would sing on the doorstep and I'd be like, yeah, or if they had a piano, I'd be like, Oh, I could play something for you. You know, so kind of offering like almost like Costco, you know, like let me give you a little sample, a little sample on it. If you like the cheese, you can buy the whole, whole bag. So, um, I tried to give them a little sample of it, but, um, yeah, that it was just real simple like that. And, or it was me apologizing because now they're babies awake because I rang the doorbell. I'm sorry, my music will put them back to sleep. Right. Yeah. That's, see, I should have segwayed into that. The music will make them go to sleep. Do you have copies of all your old albums? Like, how cool would that be to have like a collection of peers every album? Like I sold door to door? I believe I do. And you know what's crazy? If you go on eBay, people are selling them for like $100. No, I'm like, I, they make me feel really cool. I'm like, ooh, people pay a hundred. Like, you could probably Google, you could probably look it up. My brother sent me one like two weeks ago and it was like before the fame. And I was like, I'm really not famous, but that's cute. That's so cool. Yeah. So, um, people sell different, um, albums and I still get hit up at least once a week where someone says, Oh, this song, you know, was, you know, an important part of my life or something. There it is. There's out. I'm gonna buy them right now as we're sitting here. Okay. Which ones? So we got, we've got, um, 2006, 2007. Those are the two that are popping in there. I'm buying them both right now. So I'm going to be, will you sign these next time you come out? Yeah. Those are like the worst songs I ever wrote in my life. So don't judge me. This is going to be like, oh, and you know what? I was so emo. I don't know if it's the one, my very first album. I'm like sitting in the corner like this. So emo. And it's like black and white and the album's called cry. Like it's so emo. You know when you're like 13 and you're like, but I was like 16. I was still like so emo, like life is hard. People don't understand me. So the hell albums like me, like cry, like that album is called cry. It was so bad, but we shot it with a disposable camera. So you could take like 17 photos and you had to wait like a week for it to get developed. But yeah, that was the, I don't know if that was the, I don't think that was the first one. I'll have to get to the next one. I'm going to learn how to use every time it pops up. I'm going to get the entire collection eventually and have you sign them all. So I'm actually, I'm really pumped about that. So as you're doing door approaches, I'm curious, I have so many funny, like strange, weird stories, but what are some stories for you as you're knocking on doors, like some of the weird or awkward or whatever things that happened that you remember. So many things. Like one that always, there's two that always stick out. So I had a little scooter. So I made it, and I don't know if you ever did this. You were walking, weren't you? You were walking. So I had a little electric scooter because I could cover more doors quicker. So I would take my little electric scooter. And I remember if there were like kids in the neighborhood, other kids would like, I ended up with like a posse. So I was like the head of like the 10 year olds, you know, I was like, I would have been really cool. Like if I was 10, it's not so cool that I'm like 18, but okay. So, you know, I'm on my little electric scooter that I would charge every night. And then I would go up to these houses and then I remember this one guy, he answers the door literally in like, like little white underwear. And he's like, Hey, what's going on? I'm like, do you want to buy one of my help? Like what do you do? Like do you turn around and run? You know, and then he had this like big dog in the back and he's like, Oh, just come inside. And I was like, and I didn't really know what to do, you know? And so I said, I'm afraid of dogs and I like took off running. Like I just didn't know what else to do because I didn't want to be like, it's you. Instead, it's like, it's your dog that's scared. That just felt like more believable in my mind than saying, no, I don't want to walk into a stranger's house in their underwear. That's like the beginning of like a murder movie. So I was thinking about the people who like, who answered the door, it happened us all the time too. It's like, would you answer the door in your underwear? Like, wouldn't you? It was the weirdest. Yeah, so just to know that you think that's okay. Like, what else do you think is okay? Like that's already, I'm not walking into your house. And then another time, there was like a huge dog chasing me. It was like a pit bull. And I was on my electric scooter and I'm just going, I'm just flying. And it's, and I have my like bag of CDs. And I just remember these, like two guys outside, like they're like America type guys, you know, they have like a pickup truck and they're like an American flag and they're like drinking a beer. And I'm screaming because there's this, I'm like, help, you know, so terrible. And then I just look over there, these guys are like on lawn chairs, you know, like the $10 lawn chairs you buy from Walmart, they're just having a beer and they're just like with the aviator glasses. And I'm like, this, they're not even laughing. Like in my mind, I'm thinking, this has got to be hilarious. There's this poor girl, just like it's 120 degrees outside on her little scooter getting chased by a dog. Like the whole thing I'm looking over here and there's like America, like proud to be an American's like playing over their radio. Like it was just so like bizarre, you know, and then luckily the dog turned around and I got away with it. But yeah, just so I probably, I knocked on tens of thousands of doors and it would be about 100 doors a day. I did that for, yeah, till I was like 23. So yeah, all kinds of craziness. That's so cool. I like sharing, I wanted to share that part because I think some people get into entrepreneurship and they don't understand like to be successful. Like most people put in a lot of time ahead of time, right? I remember Jamie Cross who, you know, she sells soaps and when she came to ClickFun, she built the soap funnel and launched it and hit Two Comic Club. But what people don't know is before that she was selling her soaps to her door and Jake learned what the hooks were and what the pitch was. And then she was in farmers' markets and people walking by, she had learned how to like, how do we get somebody to stop and walk over to my boot? And then what's the story? I just like, she'd done that for years over and over and over again to the point where when she put it in the funnel, she knew the message, she knew the hooks was very fast, you know? I think the same thing for you is you're going out there like, you know, you know every objection, you know, every hook, you know, things that work, things that don't work and all that kind of stuff. So like when you, when you step into the next selling situation or whatever, like you have all that stuff that a lot of people are missing out on, you know? Right. Well, and then also already you're not having to get past like any belief system, you just already know the data is, majority of people say no and occasionally one person says yes. So you already walk in going, every no is like closer to like a yes. And then just knowing, kind of just knowing I need an offer and then I just need to find people to buy it. And I think now to, you know, there's paid traffic and you can run ads and all that kind of thing. But if you don't run ads, you can just go straight to where they are, they're at. And for me, it was they're at home. That's where they are. Like, and just finding where they're congregating, like you always talk about, where's your ideal customer congregating and go pitch to them and just being okay with people telling you no, you know, and that sometimes people are going to hate you for it too. But there's occasionally going to be someone that's really grateful for you and that one person makes up for everybody else, you know? So cool. There's a story I want to ask you about, but if it's too personal, you don't want to feel free. But remember you told me the story about, I remember the whole, all the details, but somebody who you knocked on the door and they met you later and gave you more money and kind of changed the trajectory. Do you remember someone who, who I'm going to tell the story, but it's probably incorrect in my head. There's someone you met and they said, meet me later at a diner or something like that. Oh, yeah. Oh, this is great. Oh, I would love to tell this story. It was actually like a really challenging time for me, like with my faith and my beliefs at that time, because I was kind of going through this, like, do I believe in something bigger? Do I leave in, you know, like, where am I here? Do I believe in God? Do I not believe in God? You know, like just kind of at this place where it's just like, I don't know. And I was, but I'm always believed in, like, there was this huge part of me that's really faith driven. Like, if you just believe something will happen, like it will, you know, you just believe hard enough and you take actions towards it. And I was, I had just left New Mexico and where I'm from, it's, it's actually, I was looking up this the other day, more murders per capita than any other state in the country. And there was a lot of things, you know, I had bullet holes in my car, bullet holes in my house, there was a lot of violence. My, you know, boyfriend had died of a drug overdose, like there was all these different, you know, things and I had decided that I was going to get out of it, but I was in debt and I had, you know, been in this physically abusive relationship. I just just said this place was just a really low part of my life. And I was, as I was leaving New Mexico, I ran over a screwdriver, like my car, like, just went to, like, and then these girls stole my phone. I mean, it was just all bad. And I was like, I remember my friends being like, that's a sign. You don't need to leave. I'm like, I am going to crawl out of this state. I don't care. Like, I don't care what I'm crawling out of the state. So I finally get out and I randomly go to Las Vegas and I'm, I'm actually like, if you know, couchsurfing.com, it's like people randomly, I know, it's already sound. Yeah, it's the real thing. It's couchsurfing.com. If someone has a couch, they'll say, hey, if someone's in town, it needs a place to crash, you can crash my place. So I reached out to maybe like 100 people and like three people had said yes. And there was like, there was this guy and he was like, yeah, you know, you can come stay. And I go and there's like 30 other women there. It's really weird. And there's like people everywhere. And then he's like, cooking up with one of the girls in the room. And so I go and I sit on the pavement. And I'm like, how did I end up here? Like all the things like, how did I end up here? And I'm in the pavement. I can hear the guy and the girl inside. And I'm like, this is weird. And then I'm on the website, Craigslist. And someone says that they need someone to watch their dogs. And I was like, I'll watch your dogs if I can stay in your house. Because he's going on vacation. He's like, sure. So I show up. He has this beautiful home, hands me the keys to like a convertible car. Like, there's just, and he has nine Pomeranians, nine Pomeranians and like six fish. And he like leaves and he's gone for like weeks or whatever. So I'm just there in this like house. And I have no money. And I don't know what I'm doing. But it's just like, it's just kind of things are like, they're okay though. Like I'm not on the street, though, you know, like I'm here, I'm taking care of these nine Pomeranians. I just remember they would attack me every day. And I was still really depressed because of where my life was. And he doesn't know this. I hope he's watching this. I left the water on in his kitchen and it flooded the entire place. So I get home and the whole place is flooded. Nine Pomeranians are attacking me and I'm crying. So I'm like crying in this kitchen. But I mean, like, I never really thought of how funny that image is now imagining how funny this was. And so then I'm like, you know what, I still have my CDs, I'm going to go out. And so I go out onto the street and I'm selling, you know, I'm going door to door. And I had decided that I needed a promo video. I needed a video that showed what a good performer I was. I'm a classical pianist. I need to show that I'm a, you know, great pianist, I'm a singer, because I want to go and start performing at the casinos. But I knew I needed a video. And so I'd kind of budgeted it all out. And it was like $7,000. And at that time, $7,000 might have, should have like, might as well have been $100 million. Like there's no way I could come up with $7,000 at that time. And just something was like, again, going back to like that faith. And I was like, I just, I feel like I don't know how to make money, but I know how to do music. And if I just say, all right, God, you know, this is up to you, like I'm just going to let you do with the money stuff. I'm just going to do what I know how to do. I'm going to go door to door. And when I would go door to door, I'd make maybe a hundred bucks. I wasn't making a whole lot. But I was like, you know, I'm going to schedule this shoot in about 12 days. So hopefully you can come up with $7,000 in 12 days. You know, and for me, even going door to door every single day, I would have made like $1,200, you know, it wasn't a lot. And so I went door to door that day. And that day I started reaching out, I started hiring musicians, I started hiring choreographers, videographers, I started, you know, and I just kept walking with faith. It was faith, faith, faith, it will happen. And I'm going to take all the, I'm going to take all these steps that show that I believe, you know, I'm going to hire the videographers, I'm going to hire, I rented out the studio, which was like $100 an hour. And, you know, I surrender all that stuff. And that day, I'm like, all right, I'm going to go out door to door. And so I go door to door. And I, I vaguely remember this guy, but he bought a CD and I used to sell the CDs for $10. And that night, it was my space days, back in my space, I get a message on my space. It's like, Hey, you sold me a CD today. And I would love to make a donation. I'd love to donate another $200 or $300 to what you're doing and to your music career. Now he doesn't know, I didn't tell anybody about my situation. Nobody knew about my financial situation. Nobody knew that I was making a promo video. I kept that to myself. And so I was like, great, great, great. And I was like, I felt so good. I'm like, awesome. There's going to be like 20 more guys like that that are like, I just want to donate $200 in the next 12 days. Like, sure, this is going to be great. So I go to Starbucks and we sit there and he's like, he's just really like, like scared, timid guy. And he's, he's just like, he just asked me a bunch of questions. And he was just kind of like, he was very sad. And he's like, I'm really successful. And my family doesn't talk to me. He was just kind of really sad, but he was asking how I stayed so excited about what I was doing. Cause he's like door to door sucks. He's like, why are you so happy? And I'm like, well, I just know that this isn't the end of my story. This is the middle of my story. And every story, there has to be like the part where it's hard, right? And I always kind of looked at it like, or else it's not even a story worth telling. You know, so I just, I know that this isn't the end. And that drives me because I'm like, oh, cool, like I'm having a capture of, I'm getting, you know, getting attacked by bomber radians, whatever. Like these are all stories I get to tell when I'm successful and walking so it makes this not painful. Instead I go, ooh, let me write this down. You know, so I'm telling about my journey. And anyways, he looks at me at the very end and he says, how do I spell your name? And again, I had never told him about any of, and this is within 24 hours of my prayer of everything, you know, me hiring people. And he says, what's, how do I spell your name? And I told him, and he pulls out a checkbook and he goes, I don't even know why I'm doing this. Something is telling me that I'm supposed to do this. And he said, you never have to talk to me again. You owe me nothing. And he writes something down and in the checkbook, he closes it and he hands it to me. And we talk briefly and I'm like, I'm scared to open it because it's just such everything that's happening. Like life is just so crazy at this point. And he leaves that Starbucks and I just wait inside the Starbucks and I like so scared to open the check because I don't know what, you know, I'm like, what is this? And I like, I grabbed the check and I like, open it up and it's a check for $10,000. And I immediately started crying. And I go into the bathroom and I like sit in the corner of like the Starbucks. And I'm just like, it was such a feeling of like everything to me was falling apart in this realm, in earth. But if the creator of this earth is on my side, then it doesn't matter what's happening here. It doesn't matter because if I have a team member that created all this stuff, you know, like that's, that's my team member right here. Like, that's a pretty good team member to have. And so I just thought, wow, that was 24 hours. And I felt like, you know, you hear these stories of like the waitress that, you know, someone wrote a check to pay for their college education or you hear those things, you never, ever think that that would happen to you. And I never would have guessed that within 24 hours of just making the decisions and moving in faith would, would like that within 24 hours, I would have exactly the, you know, more than what I needed. And especially in such a large amount of money. And yeah, it was so yeah, that that was a mind opener. So for me, it was just reiterated, like faith is so powerful, you know, and just walk and moving in faith and taking steps in faith. So and if there you went and made the made the video? Yeah, I mean, that was so then I didn't, I mean, that wasn't until, okay, I read your book, Experts Secrets Years Later, because after that, I actually got into performing. So I finally figured it out. I made my videos and I performed and I traveled the world and did all the yeah, and I yeah, I did all the things that a musician would want. I earned seven figures as an independent musician and toured and did some cool things. But that was over the span of my career. You know, and then when I read Experts Secrets, I was at the point where I was about to have a baby. I was like, I can't be like touring around and like living this rock star life anymore, you know, and then decided that I would get into coaching. So and that's then the first ad came out. Yeah. All right, so let's dive in that side of the story now. So you did that first ad and obviously we watched that earlier today, but explain, because you created an offer for people like you who are struggling musicians who couldn't maybe get on, you know, how getting published. Like what was the offer that you created initially that the ad sold? Yeah, yeah. So I went from, my first offer was actually a course. I sold a 997 course and that was when I was still living in Vegas. And then I was actually, I was joking today because I was living in this garage when I held my first webinar. So you were like, hold a webinar once a week. And I'm like, okay, I'm gonna hold a webinar. And I held the webinar and I was living in this garage because at this point I had separated from my son's dad. It was like everything just kind of lost everything overnight. And I'm five months pregnant. I'm all depressed again. You know, it's just like this sad story. And then there's a water softener in the side corner. And if you've ever listened to a water softener in a garage, it's like, and so I'm like, I'm doing the webinar. I'm like, Hey, everybody, I just want to talk to you. And then the water. I'm just so excited to talk to you guys about this, you know, trying to talk over the water. But I sold something online and I sold, I sold a course and I was like, Oh my God, I just made like $1,000. This is crazy. And then I had moved to New Mexico and now I don't have Wi-Fi. And so I was like, okay, I can't sell the course anymore. I can't do webinars anymore. And so then I created a book. And so I would work on this book. And then it was like a $19 book that I decided to sell online. And it was crazy because again, I couldn't do any like dramatic demonstrations. I wasn't doing any webinars or challenges or any live masterclasses or anything. I just was running paid ads. But that funny ad that, you know, everyone was commenting on it. Everyone was liking it. Everyone was sharing it. My first month, I think it was like a, it was like a $47,000 net profit month, which was, I didn't even realize how wild that was. That's a $19 ebook. And I had made some other $19 ebooks. And then because some of the books weren't finished yet, I just sold them unfinished. I'm like, pre-order it. It's coming. This could be awesome. This was a great thing. Because when I tell people, like, you could sell something that's not even done yet. You just got to be honest about, Hey, it's not done. You can't just be like, surprise, it's not finished, but I'll send it to you later. You know, so I put, you know, Hey, it's coming. You'll have it in a month. So in the funnel, I added other books that didn't exist yet. I said, but you, they will. So I'm writing a book on this and this and this. And so, um, and then I had a little mini course at the end. And again, I couldn't do any coaching, but you know, I used click funnels and it automatically activated the email that would send them their product. So they got their product, they saw the product, the ad brought them in, and I didn't have to do anything else. And that was like really reassuring for me because I was, you know, raising my son. He had just been born. I was breastfeeding. It was just like, I didn't have a car. I was living on this farm, you know, all that kind of stuff. So it was a, it, that was, that was absolutely crazy, but it was really those funny ads. Like people were just, they were watching, they were consuming them. And because they, the product was good, right? The offer was good. But then when you get someone to laugh, they're, they immediately, they like you, right? They immediately like you as soon as you get them to laugh. I'm like, this is crazy. So yeah, that was like my very first ad to like a low ticket. And I couldn't believe that I can make so much even just selling like a $19 book. Yeah. So cool. I'm curious, I have a guess on this. I'm curious if you know the stats, but because right now, as you know, ad costs are going up, up and up. And what's interesting, I assume is with the funny ads, I'm assuming the ad cost is like cost to acquire customers way lower because there's variety, variety of reality. People share it. There's, there's people socially interacting with it. Like if you have stats or numbers to show like a traditional thing versus, versus like a funny ad, like just the cost to acquire customers or anything. I really should get like more on the stats side, but what this is what I will notice, what I have noticed immediately when I would bring in funny ads, the sales at one point, I remember one time I had the same ad, I didn't change the ad spend or anything. The sales had tripled on one of the ads. And it was, it was like the second ad that I had offered. And then I was able to scale more because I hadn't gotten to a point where I could keep spending more, you know, you every time you increase your ads budget, you want to continue to be doing this, right? You want to make more or you want to break even whatever your goals are. But for me, I couldn't, I was keeping this one ad, I had a really serious ad that I just couldn't scale. And the moment that I brought in the funny ones, I was able to actually spend more and scale more. And that, that that point, that was like a trip, like a trip. I was like, what triple? Like that was insane. And I've definitely, definitely noticed also the, the reach and how many people share, how much organic reach you get because everyone's sharing it to their friends. And because like the toilet ad, for example, it was like, you'd probably look like this or you're probably sitting on the toilet right now. You know, you'd have like Mary Smith be like, oh my gosh, Yolanda, isn't this like, this is you all day. You know what I mean? Or, you know, like they would like send their friend, you know, to their friends. Yeah, they tag their friends. And so then their friends would go, who's this girl? And then they would like, they would start talking and stuff. And so it was really cool to also see the organic and how much it was, people were sharing it. And then to see like millions, it was like real quick, like the first, I don't know, it was like a year or two years, it was like 60 million views. It was like 60 million views. Like that was insane. Like it was absolutely insanity. And I wasn't posting every day. That's a lot of people. Yeah. And I wasn't posting every day at all. I wasn't doing anything. It was just from like, yeah, just from paid traffic. And now we do, because we do ads for other companies that use just, you know, just serious ads. And now they've replaced like everything with fun, you know, fun. And they don't have to necessarily be like funny. Like they don't have to have like a kick, but just fun, something that makes people go, they don't take life too seriously. You know, they're a fun person. I want to work with them. If I'm going to choose someone to work with, I want to work with them. Yeah, so cool. So, so afterwards you obviously were doing it for this musician, the music business. But then I know later you started, I don't know if you're partnering brands or buying brands, but you have a couple of other companies started doing these for you. Talk about, let's cool about this is you mastered this thing for your own business. And then like the skills that you master, now you're able to like leverage the equity in other businesses for applying that skill, which is so fascinating. This is the, this is so cool. And so a friend of mine had a Cologne company and they were running ads and they were losing money. And I was able to quickly identify a couple things, right? Their ads were terrible and they didn't have a funnel. And so I was able to, I just called him and I was like, and again, I'm on the farm. So I'd seen it. And I'm like, so I'm like starting an ads agency on a farm with no wifi. Like at the time I didn't think of how wild this was. I just saw that it worked. And I'm like, it worked for me. It should work for him. And so I called him. I'm like, there's this thing called a funnel and you like set it up and it'll take me like a week. I got to build it out. But let me run your ads and let me, you know, kind of do this stuff and we'll do a 50-50 split. And he was like, yeah, yeah, let's do it. Let's do it. And so he had showed me his ads account. They were losing money, but they were still getting sales. And I was like, oh, if I just tweaked a couple things, I believe this would be profitable. And so, you know, worked out a 50-50 rev share. And immediately, I mean, it was like similar numbers to the book. I mean, it was like thousands a day. It was like right away. And it was like these funny ridiculous ads that were shooting with the cell phone. Like this isn't like video production. But the very first ad I shot in the backyard, I didn't even have the cologne. And I think this is a big thing for people. So there's two things here. One, I didn't have any cologne. And two, recognizing that anybody that sees this ad has never smelled this cologne. So I think most people would go, that's not going to work. There's even, and we have no Wi-Fi. And we have no, like there's so many things. But what I did was I was like, but wait, we have software. So I'd be like, guys, check out the cologne. And then we just put the cologne there, like an image. And we would say, you know, stuff like, are you this guy? It's like a lonely guy. Well, you got to smell good. So you could have all the ladies and then just show all these ladies around the guy. So it's just like these images. Like there's no people. And I'm in the backyard. Like there's like pecans. And like my mom's washer and dryers or the toilets like over there. Like it's still there. Everything's still there. Yeah, like the toilet's there. But it just started selling. So then I did it for a brick and mortar company. I did it for myself food. I sold it. I set up the same ad in the same backyard, but I'm holding a plate of tamales. And I'm like, tamales, you want some tamales? And I'm in the ad, you know? And so I, but it just worked. And I saw work across every niche. I saw work across everything. And the, you know, the cologne company, we actually got a two comic club award for selling millions of dollars of cologne that nobody's smelled before, which was crazy. So yeah, so it was really cool. It's like, once you master ads, like you can now, you know, most people, their, their problem is traffic. They can't get traffic. They have a good offer and they have no idea how to get traffic or they're not willing to do what needs to be done to get traffic. Right? Sometimes there's ego and they don't want to like, even how we went door to door, right? I love how like there was no ego. It's like, all my ego is gone. It doesn't exist. And so, uh, yeah, it was like a quick, yeah, it was it to have that now. And now I work with different companies. I have a very similar arrangement with each one, depending on what I'm doing. And some of that's everything like building out the, because I built out the entire funnel. I'm also like, oh, this is how we built it out. And this is, it's not just the funny ads, but also like helping with the entire cell structure. And to me, that's so fun. I love it because you tweak a couple things, like just a few little things and it makes like huge, huge differences. So it was really cool to like acquire that skill. And then now, working with other companies and like, they've done all the work to create the products. You know, the cologne company did all the shipping. I'm not having to do anything. I'm just promoting them on the front end. Yeah, this is awesome. Can we show when the clone ads? Yeah, the top secret. Yeah. And let me, okay, let's do it. Okay, we're gonna show a clone ad right here. So you guys see it. Hey guys, I want to show you this amazing cologne. It's called LPR. And did I mention that it has pheromones in it? Pheromones are scientifically proven to attract women to men. What? Let me demonstrate. I'm so lonely. None of the ladies love me. I'm gonna die alone. Now watch what happens. I love you Billy. I love you too, Billy. What am I gonna do? All these ladies want me. How am I gonna choose one? You don't have to choose one, Billy. You can have us both. Yeah. Like the link to get LPR cologne straight to your door. Okay, question that I think people are gonna ask me. You said you didn't have a Wi-Fi. If you had no Wi-Fi, you record that on your phone, then how are you getting it on the internet? Oh yeah, no, this is a good question. I left this out. Magically, it just appeared on the internet. I know. Well, I remember when Elon did the, he came up with the Wi-Fi. I was like, yes, finally gonna have Wi-Fi. And it was like, not in your area. And I'm like, dang it. Everyone was glad it's everywhere. But where we were, there's like, there's crop circles everywhere. Like if you'd focused on our area, like two people would have signed up. So, but what I would do is I would wait till my mom got home every day and I would use her car because I didn't have a car either. And then I would drive into town to Wi-Fi and then I would upload the ads. And so there was a lot of like, what was interesting too is I couldn't check the stats constantly. It's not like you want to refresh your phone. Yeah, yeah. Like I couldn't always do it. Right. Exactly. It's just like, I just remember being like, please little baby Jesus, please sell some stuff. My baby needs diapers. You know, and so I'd go down and upload the stuff and then I'd go home and I'd be like, I just sit there. Just waiting. Yeah, waiting. Like and I'd get mad. I'd get so mad at my mom because sometimes she'd come home late. I'm like, when are you coming home? You know, because I'm just sitting there like a baby, like just sitting there. Like I gotta go check these ads. And yeah, it was like, it took like a few days. But what was cool was I didn't have a budget. I didn't have like a designated budget. I think the first day I spent like 60 bucks or 80 bucks or something like that. And so it wasn't a lot, but I made like 120. And so then I was like, okay, cool. I made 40 bucks. And so the next day I spent a little bit more. And then I made it, you know, if I spent 150 bucks, now I'm making 250 bucks. You know, whatever that looked like. And I just kept on scaling until all of a sudden I had spent like $10,000 that month. But if somebody originally had said, do you have $10,000 to spend, you know, I would have been like, no, God, no, I'm not going to spend $10,000. And I think also a really like, really like big moment for me too was it was during COVID. And I had gotten a approval for an unemployment check. And they were like, here you can go get your unemployment. And it was right before I kind of launched all these funny ads and stuff. And this kind of goes back to faith, right? And I look at the unemployment and check and I said, if I accept this check, I'm going to get in a lot of trouble because I'm about to make a lot of money. And so I didn't take it. And I look back then, and I think if any single mom had taken that check, I wouldn't have been thought any less of them. You have a child, there's a check right here for quite a bit of money that would have helped you. But I was so confident. Like what you said, like when you would say like a funnel works, when you would say you can sell your stuff online, when you said you can sell your knowledge online, it just made sense to me. And I just believed you. And so that's such a huge part of my life was that I believed what you said. And that when the check was in front of me, I'm like, I'm not taking this because I'm going to get in so much trouble because the government's going to come back to me. And they're going to say, I made way too much money. Why did I take this check? Because I'm going to make way too much money this year. It's going to happen this year. And so I didn't take the check. And it ended up happening. You know, I ended up making more money than I'd ever made in my whole life. But it was just kind of having that belief and walking like you believe in it, not walking like you have a plan B, you're walking like, you know, like this is it, this is what's going to work. I believe it's going to work. And I'm just going 100% so much that I'm not even going to, I'm not taking this check right now. So it was really, really cool when I look back on it now. I just recently read a book called The Magic of Believing. I'm not sure if you've read it, but it's like a classic old book about that. And it's fascinating because I've said this before, but I've never seen someone who is skeptical and successful, like those two things don't go together. And like it just your story, like every single time you're like, okay, I believe in this thing. And so you just, you weren't skeptical. You're like, I believe it. I'm going to do it. And then everything showed up. Right. And it's, it's like to see the pattern in life three or four times now where that's the thing you're doing. It's like, hopefully people will listen to that because our society's taught us to be skeptical of everything. And it's just like, like obviously you got to protect yourself, but it's like, man, when you're skeptical, like it's just hard to, you don't take the steps forward. You're always second guessing and you don't make the actions versus like, I'm just going to believe and go and then see what happens. Like that's when that's when magic shows up, you know? Yeah. Well, and I also think it's just like people hear the, the, if you just, I make most of my decisions just off like logic, like what you said, like when I would read the book, I'm like, okay, this makes sense. It doesn't matter what I believe. It doesn't matter what my, you know, track record has, but it doesn't matter. Everything that you said and made sense. And when you said, these are the numbers, this is all it has to do is convert it 1% on a webinar and you have a million dollar webinar. And when you break down the number, I'm like, this makes sense. That's all I don't need the majority people. And I, you know, from the experience going door to door, right? Nine out of 10 people can tell you know, and you can still, you know, get yes, a few percentage will. So there's logic there. It's when we start thinking emotionally and we go, but am I good enough? Am I this? You know, and what I tell everyone always, I was talking to a young lady yesterday who was actually in tears and she was so sweet and she was like, how are you so confident on what you're doing? How do you, you know, like basically like, how are you walking in faith? You know, how are you so confident what you're doing? And I'm like, okay, let me just stop right there. Everyone tells you, you got to be great and you got to be so good. So everyone's focusing here. So for you to believe that you can sell something, you believe, you have to believe you have to be amazing. So everyone goes to all these like life coach stuff and they're like, I'm amazing. I'm worth it. They wake up in the morning and they're listening to their mornings like you are valuable. You are loveable. And I'm like, let me just tell you something. A chiapet is so pointless. It's just grass. That's all it is. They have made millions of dollars. The shake weight is pointless. The pet rock is pointless millions and millions of dollars. And so she starts laughing and I said, do you believe that you could offer a fraction of the value that a chiapet offers? And she starts laughing. She's like, yes. And I'm like, so you don't even got to be great. You just got to offer something of some sort of value to the world and you could work for yourself and you could have a business and you could be successful. And at that point it's just like, you don't got to believe you just got to believe you're kind of good. Like that's it. Like, are you kind of good, you know, and, and obviously do your best, be the best you can be, always be growing. But I think everyone thinks you got to be like, I got to be this, you know, perfect entrepreneur. Then I can do it. But hey, if you just have something and you had always said something that was so powerful, when you said, wherever you are, when it comes to selling education, is there someone that would want to be where you are? And that hit me. And it was like, yeah, like I've toured and I've sung and even if I'm just singing at a restaurant, there's plenty of people that would rather do that than working at Starbucks, you know what I mean? And so, you know, if that's their dream. And so I just thought, yeah, that's if there's just a thousand people a year that want the same dream that I have, if I sell a thousand dollar course, I don't know my math right now, a $70 million, something like that, whatever those numbers are, I can make a really great living. And that's just a small percentage of the world that just have to want to be where I am. And I'm not famous. I'm not Beyonce. I'm not any of those things. But I could help them get there. And that belief and so going, Hey, actually, you could just believe in little things and you could still do amazing. And I love that because no matter where you are, and then you can grow and ascend. And I don't know, I just thought that was really powerful when you said that. So that's awesome. So cool. Okay. So for people watching us now who are curious, like, I want to make funny ads, like, is there a process or like, how can somebody, I don't consider myself funny. What are some ideas I could, that you'd help me generate? Like, here's something you could do or something that people watching home could do to create a fun ad. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Okay. So there's a really simple formula that I always tell everyone, your hook is the most important thing. The first few seconds of your ad is the most important thing. You want to capture someone's attention. And so the easiest way to make something funny, even if you're not funny, and even if your business is not funny, no, no business is funny. Okay. Like, no business, like nothing's, nothing's funny. Right. Unless you sell like whoopee cushions or something, you know, like there's like fart spray, like this is not funny. Okay. So if you're selling, like, let's say you're selling, I always use this example, let's say you're someone that teaches busy moms how to make a living. What you do is you just write down what all their challenges are. So what's their challenge? You know, dirty diapers, kids, they don't have any time. They're exhausted, you know, you start just writing all of their challenges. And then what you do is you take their challenge and you exaggerate it. And so, and this is like, I call this the Muhammad Ali, like boom, boom punch type thing. So this is like Muhammad Ali hook. So what you do is you say, Hey, are you tired of like, are you a mom? So you call out the person here, are you a busy mom who wants to be an entrepreneur? But it's hard for you to, you know, get started because and boom, boom punch is the boom, boom is you offer two like actual real legitimate things. Like, you're having exhausted, you know, you're exhausted, you have no time. And then you offer and you fit, you're tired of feeling like this. And visually, you just show the exaggeration, like there's a kid, like there's like, there's a, you know, a poop on the wall, you know, your hair looks like you just got like electrocuted, you know, you haven't done your makeup, maybe your mascara is like everywhere, you know, and you have like a calculator, but you're trying to do sales, there's like the dogs like pulled your underwear out into the living room, you know, like just exaggerating whatever the problem is. And we even did this with when we did Brooke Castillo's ad, when we said, Are you tired of feeling stuck? And I'm like wedged in like two mattresses, like you can't even like, you couldn't even get yourself in like, it took like five of us to like even get me into the mattress, you know, but just showing like, and so it's like you're stuck, but like you're obviously in like a really weird, like, are you tired of being stuck? Like, I'm in a mattress, like guys, I don't even know I ended up here. That kind of thing, like the visual is so easy to do, like you don't even have to be funny to do that, you know, like that's a really, you know, are you tired of being broke, you know, you're in front of the dollar store, like, you know, like just different things that you could be, that you could exaggerate. So really, all it is, is calling out your customer, writing down all of their pain points and just exaggerating it. And you could just say, are you tired of this? And you just exaggerate the heck out of that. And that's all such a simple way. And the rest of your ad could just be, it doesn't, you don't even have to add a ton of comedy. That first hook is so important, it already set the tone. And now you can say, Hey, well, guess what? I have my new make, you know, $100,000 just year during nap time, or you know, whatever it is at that point. And then at they've, you're, they're already hooked, because you've, because then they're looking at that and they're going, that's me. And then they start tagging their friends like, Hey, Mary, look, look, this is us. You know, like they have all their mom friends or they have their other friends that are in the same business or trying to achieve the same goal. And they start sharing your ad because it reminds them of themselves. And that's what you want. You want them to look at and be like, that's me. Cause they like to laugh at themselves. Yeah. So cool. Do you have a site where it just has like every ad you ever created, people go look at like, I feel similar. They add some product. Like, I want to display these as art because they're so cool. You know, it's like an app. I want to show everybody. Like, it'd be cool if you did something. I think you can go see like here's Christine's ad. She's ever written and created. Like, it'd be so much fun to see it all. I have a bunch of ads. Oh, I should put them. Maybe I'll put them all on. Maybe by the time you air this, I'll have them all on there. Laughmyadsoff.com. Yeah. So we have a bunch of, and we got a, I had bought a bunch of funny domains like, like whoop your ads.com and all kinds of like kick some ads.com. So we're able to play off that word a lot. And then, yeah, I have a lot of stuff there. Laughmyadsoff.com. So awesome. Well, this has been so much fun. And I'm grateful for you. I know you've come and, you know, you came to unlock the Secrets Our Kids event. And it was cool because you taught this process to the kids and you had all the kids going to write ads. It's all the kids. And yeah, what if we can show something? I don't think you can show the kids ads. It may be, but like they all came back and they did ads and we had, we picked a winner who had the funniest ad. But it's cool because even if like the adults are like, oh, I'm just, you know, all the kids did like, tell your kids, like, hey, go make me a funny ad. Yeah, make your kids do it. Slave them away. And then you did Fun Hockey Live. And the same thing. I think it was cool because so many people in the audience there, like they've seen funny ads that again, big production companies make like, oh, I can't afford that. And also they saw it and was like, I could actually do that. Like it's something that's, you know, that it may seem so simple and real. Yeah. Cause it was, it was just using, leaning to the humor and the, you know, and the scripting versus, you know, high production and stuff like that. But I think it's what you're doing so good for just our community and for everybody and getting people belief they can do it. And it just makes ads more fun too, which just makes the internet more fun. Right. Well, and you know what, what's so cool is, so when I was younger, we used to make like just funny skits. And I'd always, you know, dreamt, I thought, how funny, how fun would my life be if I could just do this forever? And then think, thankful to you, you're like, Hey, this is how you can turn anything into business. You know, it's a funnel. It's a funnel. And when I saw the funnel, I'm like, Oh yeah. So now I can just make funny skits. And then I just say, want to buy something, you know, I just add a call to action. Now I do get to do this. So every day I'm like, Oh my gosh, I actually get to do that thing that I wanted to do when I was a kid. I just got to sell something on the end. And so thank you for that, Russell. That was, that was you, I live my, my life dream now because of you. So thank you. That's the greatest thing ever. I love it. Very cool. All right. So everyone, go to laugh my ads off. If you want to go check out some more of the videos and see that that thank you, Christine, for being amazing, for being here and sharing this with everybody. Thank you, Russell, so much. Thank you.
