Okay, well I'm nervous. Which camera do I look at? Oh I stare at you. This is even better. Yep. Oh yep. I'm not being weird. You're being weird. What would I say to someone who wants to work here? That's a great question. Just don't expect to work hard. Expect to have a lot of fun. Expect to get paid very well for the minimal amount of work you're gonna do. That's my life motto. Work very little, get paid very lot. So Russell and I came up with ClickFunnels. It's actually really funny. We were at his mom's house and we were down in her basement and we were trying to figure out what can we do to make money. He tried that potato gun thing and he tried other stuff and I said I have this great idea. What if we created a drag and drop software that's going to allow you to build web pages and funnels quickly and easily to be able to get your product whether you're selling a physical or a digital product. What if we created something that would allow us to sell it like that? No coders, no graphic designers. None of that was really needed. He didn't like the idea but I ended up creating the whole software anyway in probably 35 minutes. He ended up taking that giving it to Todd and Todd I guess kind of took over my part of the company and I had to work my way back in. Right now I'm a 0% partner with 100% of the say. When I first started working here it was we're just going to go a hundred miles an hour all day long in at seven leave at six and I said no way. So I really started implementing the 10 to 2 regime and really trying to get us to work a lot less, more laxadaisical. We've taken a few polls and each time it comes back that I am the number one employee but I think we do we do a pretty good job letting everybody know they're important even if they're not. We're a hundred million dollar company which is okay if those guys think it's great but I think it's just decent. I plan on taking us past the five hundred million dollar mark through really becoming the face of ClickFunnels. When you're humble, you're funny and sexy, it's really easy to get a group of people behind you that'll pay for your advice. It's only downhill from here which means you're going faster. Most people say it's uphill but I believe in going down inertia, momentum, plus I don't want to walk uphill. So I hope that answers your question. Business partner? Dude, he's barely an intern. Like, did he tell you that?
