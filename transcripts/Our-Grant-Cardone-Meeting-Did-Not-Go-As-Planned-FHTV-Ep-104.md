I am out right now in San Francisco at Salesforce's big event. It's called Dreamforce. Well that's it. I'm going to get some sushi and then we're heading to Metallica. Alright so right now we're heading to the Metallica concert and we're not leaving until I play my favorite song. Probably the line is going to take 30 minutes to get in and we've got to leave in like 30 minutes. Do you try anyway? It's going to take us an hour here to get to the hotel and grab our 7-bit beer. It's 9 o'clock. 9 o'clock is our exit. I just hope they try to hit the marsh pit. This makes you want to fight someone so bad. We just finished Metallica and now we're heading to the Umer, heading to the airport, to fly to Chicago and hang out with Grant Cardone. Let's go. So we're in Metallica. We tried to get to the front. We got stuck. Someone had done beer on Todd. And then we snuck out finally and we are late. So now we're in Umer heading back to the hotel. Pack our bags to head to the airport because our flight leaves in like 3 hours. Not you? Yeah basically about 5-6 minutes from now we've got to be back in the lobby with our stuff. Alright dude we've got like 2 minutes here. Hurry bud. You can see real soon please. Hurry. We've got one more pass to you as I'm playing the anti-airplay. I hope. Russell! We made it. I thought we were going to be safe. Alright so we just landed in Chicago, O'Hare. It was a rough night. Dave had 57 minutes. Dan holding you right now. Had 0. I did the best I think. I feel guilty now. Oh my gosh. Okay hold on. Flashback. So 20 years ago I was on this escalator with my dad. My senior year in high school. I was going to high school nationals and we were going down this runway with these lights. So the second of the country became an All-American which changed the whole direction of my life forever. Which got me the ability to go to Division I college to wrestle in. Which is why I ended up in Boise. So I clicked the phone and got billed everything because of the trip with my dad right here. This is the cool deja vu of that moment. 20 something years ago. Russell's really tired. He's having flashback. We're nervous so we're going to be on this jet. We're going to pass out on the first moment of rest for three days. Hey guys, I'm a little bit of a snappy right now. I'm trying to work through. And Krant doesn't speak till tomorrow. Jared's not coming till tomorrow. He's apologizing. My craze is in. Holy crap. My assistant gave you the wrong date. I'm like dude we've been talking to 27th the entire time. So no reason to rush. Get some rest. Okay. What? So we are heading out of here. We're going to meet the founder and CEO of Pruvith at the Midway Airport on his private plane. We're flying down to Palm Beach. We're going to get to Palm Beach. We then will drive down to Miami. And we'll most likely end up flying back up here tomorrow with Grant Cardone and his team. And do tomorrow everything we planned on. Okay. My question is what can I do to help you get ready to go as soon as possible? Another Lincoln Navigator. We've seen him be doing all exclusive Lincoln Navigators this trip. Alright, today me and Nick stole Russell's camera. That's rad. Well let's give a little bit of backstory. So today we were supposed to meet with Grant Cardone. That's not stable. Oh, just... We were supposed to meet with Grant Cardone today and he actually isn't even here. So he's down in Florida and we have nothing to do. So the plan was to get on his private jet, fly back to Boising to build him a funnel. So what we're actually going to be doing today is just going to go hang out in Chicago and check out the sights. Let's go! So the situation with Grant is he's supposed to be in Miami right now. But he had this opportunity to go fly up to Orlando and take a look at some real estate. And what we know that is because on Instagram he goes live and we're watching like, Oh he's in the plane, he's coming here and he's like, Orlando, coming to see you. Thank you Instagram Live for letting us show you the plans. So Brian, under what the owner of Probit is supposed to be flying to Boising, his private plane tomorrow, because I have a big important meeting with him. So he rerouted his private plane to land here in Chicago right now. We're on like seven hours of sleep in the last like three days. Craziest thing is we're flying to Palm Beach to be in Miami. We have not confirmed yet that Grant can actually fly to Miami back to Chicago tomorrow. We're just hoping and praying that somehow some miracle will open up and we will end up back here tomorrow morning at nine with him. Stop it. He's talking to Grant to figure out if we can actually get back to. Alright, let me see what I can do. Alright. Okay, this is the update. This is the live update. The live update. So yeah, they actually can get us back. But now what they want is they want Nick and Jake to fly down and they want to film it on the plane from Miami to Chicago. Okay, so crazy things happening around here. So we thought we had a full day here in Chicago. But now we might be flying to Miami. So we had to turn our Uber around and come back to the hotel. Wish we had a funnel for that. Good job. Nice water. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here. How are you all ready? We're ready guys. Awesome. Alright, so we're here now. There's Brian, the owner of Prove It, and we're jumping on his plane. He's got three now, which makes total sense. We did this really cool trip to Dubai. And so like we skydived over Dubai. We did dune racing. Going down like 300 foot sand dunes. And then we played polo on camels. And so my wife fell in love with the camels. And so for Christmas I surprised her with two camels. Surprise. I have a camel. Hank and Murl. Hank and Murl? Yeah. For the country singers. Murl Haggard and Hank Williams. Do you want to do an experiment with something? Why not? Uh, yes. So this is an actual ketone ester. I think you should like drugging us. Seriously. I'm not sure, but I have anything I want for muscle. Ready? They say nice. So brand. They just don't like it. You gotta drink the whole thing. Sure. It burns. It burns. It burns. Where's the water? That's like massive mental clarity. I've been out super, super tired. But I'm like, I can go. Let's go. Let's go. I feel like I'm at my house. My seatbelt's not even on. I'm even going to security. We could be a bomb right now. I just said bomb in a plane and nobody cares. All right, so for somebody who has a vision of someday owning one or two or four jets, what would be the biggest takeaway or aha you had in the last couple of years to get somebody from wherever they're at to the next level? I think always stretch yourself. And I think the best way to stretch yourself is to put yourself in environments that you don't feel comfortable in or around people that you can learn from. I find this is just me personally. Like when I'm with you, I get inspired, right? Because you're stretching yourself. You're in the hunt, so to speak. And I think proximity is power. I think, you know, being around the right people is super important. Like as you start having success, go back to scratch. Go back to where it all started. You have a very keen awareness of what it's all about, where your family is, where you started. And I think you stay grounded in those roots. ClickFunnels wasn't seeded out of all Russell's success. It was seeded out of all of his experience through the journey. So as cliche as it may sound, business is just like life. Embrace the journey, embrace the process, and just keep moving forward. I think it's interesting too, we think about this. Tony Robbins says it's a lot like we always overestimate what we've done in the year. And underestimate what we've done in 10 years. And it's like five years ago, we were in a company together that literally made zero dollars. And we spent like, I spent six months of my life, we probably spent a year, a year and a half of your life. And it was like, we thought in the year that was going to be our big payday and it wasn't. But now it's been four years since then. We're on a private plane, half a billion dollars in sales. I don't know what I'm playing yet, but we're at 100 million dollars in sales. I just heard him say yet. We need to go. And we're now in Florida. Woohoo! It is super hot. Thank you. Do you know how to drive these things? I don't know any of them. Drive his license. Park. Oh, crap. Where's the parking brake? There you go. How do we get out of here? I don't know. Oh, that's the one. Yeah. I can't. Right now, I know. It's different. Help! Need an adult. Maybe it's like this. Stop. Don't press it when I press it. I'm sorry. Panicking out. Oh, there it is. I don't know how to put it in park. Wait, two. We're locked in a cabin and open the door. Yeah, we have everything till tomorrow morning at 5 a.m. so we got nothing else to do till then. He says drive. So, we're going to Miami. So, I was planning to stay. We waited. And now, we finally got to Miami. And now we're stuck. Long day. We're really, really, really ready to go to sleep. Good night.
