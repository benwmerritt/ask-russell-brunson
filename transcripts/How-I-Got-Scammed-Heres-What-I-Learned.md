Then he ended up stealing someone's identity, then he stole his mom's identity. Police ended up, like, raiding his house. He fled the country. And then the last message we all got, he's like, The man, Russell. Pay to sell your product. I love this guy. I honestly believe the entrepreneurs are the only people that can actually change this planet. So when I got started in this game, I was going to school at Boise State. My wife and I just got married and I was broke. She was supporting us and I was trying to figure things out. And so I would spend half my time, not half my time, the third of my time in school, the third of my time wrestling, the third of the time, like, in and out of the computer labs trying to figure out how to play this game. And I remember there was this young kid from Singapore named Joe Kumar. Anyone of you who doesn't remember, in this room, remember Joe Kumar? Joe Kumar was like an 18-year-old kid who came on the internet marketing scene. His very first idea, he was like, What if I interview all these internet gurus or everyone would call him and ask him a question? And the question he asked, this may sound familiar to some of you guys here in a second, he said, If you were to lose everything, if you lost your big fancy internet marketing name, you lost your email list, your JB partners and everything, all you had left was your knowledge and internet connection for 30 days, what would you do from day number one to day 30 to save yourself? And that was the question. And he asked a whole bunch of people and he ended up getting their answers and combining them into two e-books. And I read the headline and then it was like, there's 60 people who had their step-by-step 30-day plans and how they would start over if they were, if they'd lost everything, how they started from scratch. And I think it was 97 bucks for his e-book and I'd never bought an e-book. This is before Amazon had e-books. E-books weren't in a thing, I was confused, but it sounded like the hook I was in. And there's like 60 people, like 60 gurus he'd interviewed all in these e-books. So, Clint and I had been married for less than a year. And remember, I got the $97 on a credit card, which was again, more money than I had, bought the thing and then I got the e-book and again, I was confused. So I took it to Kingco's to print. It was like a thousand pages and they're like, with the print of a thousand pages, it's gonna cost you like a couple hundred bucks. I was like, oh, so I took the thing, shrunk it. So basically there'd be 12 pages on each page, so I could afford to actually do it. So I printed it out. So the page is like this tiny. And I printed it, my bound them in this folder. And then we went on our, as our one year anniversary, we went to Hawaii. So I had these two bound books and I'm reading them, like this page, the little tiny pages on the flight over there and then in Hawaii on the way back and I'm like circling things and like freaking out. And it was interesting that I read the very first person's plan and it was like, oh my gosh, this is amazing. The second person's and third and I started realizing everybody's plans were similar. They all had their intricacies and their differences, but all of them were basically, you need to have a product, you gotta sell the product, then you gotta drive traffic the product. And somewhere between like plan 18 and plan 40 or 50, I was like, all I need to do is create a product, have a way to sell the product, and then drive traffic the product. Like I finally got it, right? Anyway, so I got all excited. This is the part where he scammed everyone. He came out and he was like, hey, if you want to resell rights to my ebook, it's 500 bucks, I'm only gonna sell it to 10 people. And I was like, what freaking out? I don't have 500 bucks, but I have a credit card. So I called the bank, had him increase my thing by 500 bucks, I went and bought the resell rights. I was gonna be one of 10 people to sell this product. I was gonna make millions. I was gonna, like the vision was there. Turns out he didn't sell it to 10 people, he sold it to thousands of people. Like everybody on planet earth was like, this is only 10 people, this is gonna be the greatest thing in the world. He sold tons and tons and tons and tons. Then he ended up stealing someone's identity, then he stole his mom's identity and all his craziness. And then the Singapore police ended up rating his house. He fled the country. And then the last message we all got, do you remember this? The last message, he was like, hey everybody, if you think those other people's 38 plans are good, mine's the best. I'm writing it right now. And if you want a copy of it, all you need to do is fax a picture of your passport and whatever to this number and wiring information or something to this number. And I'll send you copy of my book. And that was last we all heard of Joe Kumar. He's gone. Last I heard the police are still on his hunt. He may be on this boat, maybe. We don't even know. Anyway. So there's the joke. There's a little long story. So now fast forward 15 years later and I was like, oh my gosh, that was the greatest hook of all time. What if I use that hook? He's not gonna sue me because if he comes out, he's gonna, he'll go, yo. No. No, the real story, I was actually in a decade day call with my inner circle members and they were having an idea and I was like, what used to do I told the story and I was like, Joe Kumar, in your industry you should do this. And then as I'm sitting there talking to him, I was like, oh my gosh, I should do this. And I went and I looked at 30days.com and it was nothing was on it. It had a for sale sign. So while I'm doing my decade day trying to teach, I can't remember who it was in your circle. I'm like doing the thing and I'm on the side because they can see my whole face. I'm like texting Dave. I'm like, buy this now. Whatever it cost. And so by the time I got my decade day call, I remember Dave, he's like, I got it. We own it. I'm like, we own 30days.com. This is like the greatest domain in all time. And that's the project here. What would you do? Imagine this, you suddenly lose everything, your money, your name, your reputation. You have bills piled high and people harassing you for money over the phone. And all you have left is a click funnel's account and an internet access for 30 days. What's cool about this is I was able to go ask 30 different people who all wrote their plans like this would be my framework of how I get back on top. Right, so we had this really cool framework and we used it. Okay, but I'll let this question of based on where you're right now, if you lost everything, what would be the step by step process to get back in 30 days or 60 days or whatever the timeline you wanna have, right? But how powerful of a framework is that for a question to drive a framework? How many of you guys in your business right now could literally tonight send an email to your list or do a social profile that who here would be interested if I was losing everything today or I was saying weight loss space. I gained 400 pounds last night on the cruise ship and I got a start up, I got 30 days till funnel hacking live. What would be my step by step process to get back in shape? Or the stock market's crashed, I lost my entire investment portfolio and I had to start from scratch right now at 30 days. What would I do? What would I invest in? Where would I go? How many of you guys wanna know this? Or I decided I wanted to become a dancer and I forgot everything about how to dance. What would I do to get back and compete? Whatever it is, right? Like all of us can take that framework of here's what I'm right now. If I lost it all, what would be the step by step process to get back to where I was at in a certain amount of amount of time? This has become a huge multimillion dollar year business force. This alone could be our business. The question leads to framework and the framework can be your front end, the middle of that, that are back in like, it doesn't have to be something more super creative. It doesn't have to be real 500 frameworks to be successful. Like you just build one and learn how to leverage it in each of the different phases. Like that becomes the entire business. Like this could be a $10 million business easily off of one question.
