You're letting me off, really? You said we were family, Russell. What am I supposed to tell this family? What am I supposed to tell them? This was one of the most excruciating moments of my life, the moment that I nearly lost everything for myself and also the people I cared about. This is the story of probably the longest year of my life. Starting out, we were on top of the world with the middle of the recession, and we were thriving and having so much success. And then literally overnight, we got all of our emergency accounts shut down within a couple of weeks that it lay off 93 of our employees, including friends and family members. So I remember I went to a bankruptcy lawyer that was just down the street. MUSIC Do you have any money? I have a little in my wallet. How much? $100. Great. I'll take that. And you can be my client. And I bet we can get you out of your lease. And maybe you won't have to follow bankruptcy. How are we going to do that? Have you ever acted before? So I said the call with the landlord. I remember the landlord was actually in the floor above us. So we get there, I walk into my landlord's office, and I said, hey, I'm Russell. And I've leased the seventh floor below you. This is my lawyer. Hi, I'm Russell's bankruptcy attorney. And Mr. Babowitz. Mr. Babowitz, this is the worst case I've ever taken in my 30-year career, the worst. Never have I had such a hopeless situation. It's hopeless. It's a really bad spot. It's horrible. Horrible. So hopeless. Beyond repair, really. Extremely hopeless. I'm in a bad spot. OK. I'll let you out of your lease. I need you out by Friday. Thank you. For me, I was like, this is a huge win. It means I don't want to pay $30,000 next week for our mortgage. I'll never sell them again. We spent that entire week getting rid of stuff. And I remember the last day down at the call center, somebody had a sensey candle at one point, and tipped over, and there was wax and all the carpet. And I was like, I can't pay the fee to replace this carpet. It was like, we're all crammed in this little tiny office because it's all we can afford. And we were trying to figure this thing out. We'd create an idea. We'd launch it, make a little bit of money, and have to cover payroll. We're doing little things to try to keep it flow. Second quarter projections are looking great. I was on the site looking through all the websites that were for sale. And I remember there was one website that popped up, and it's called championsound.com. This is the idea. This is the thing that's going to change everything. I put an offer in on the auction site, and we won. And we won the auction for championsound.com, guys. Stacy, if you could transfer that to our servers, that would be awesome. Hey, we have a problem. This is coded in Ruby on Rails, so we're going to need a new server. What's Ruby on Rails? It's a different programming language. Stacy couldn't do anything, and the site was broken, and all these problems were happening. They had a couple customers. The customers were messaging us, angry. They were like, it's not working, and things are happening. And then I was walking out the door, and I had this weird impression as I was leaving. And the impression was like, there's somebody, one of your customers probably knows Ruby on Rails, maybe they'll partner with you. And I was like, huh. So I walked back in, turned my computer back on, and went to my customer list, and I sent an email to all my customers. And then one guy sent a message through, he was like, hey, I'm a Ruby developer, and I got my own business on site, I'm not interested in being an employee, but if you're looking for a partner, I'd be more interested to look at it. And I remember at first I was like, ah, this made me a little nervous. I was clicking on a thing, going to his Facebook profile, and I looked at it, and he's like a super normal looking guy. And I was like, there's no way this guy's like a hardcore programmer. And I saw his beautiful wife and his daughter. But I messaged him, and he said, yeah, just send me the login, and I'll see if I can fix it. And while I was in there, I noticed this, this, and this, and I changed this, and I added this, and all these things, and he's like, oh, by the way, wouldn't it be cool if we did that? And he had all these ideas, and I was like, oh my gosh, like, who is this guy? And we started getting to know each other, no more weight on the shoulders. We had this shot where we could be creative again. I wasn't building something to like, keep myself out of jail. So Todd started coming to Boise, he'd fly to Boise, probably once a quarter, so he'd fly to Boise, and he'd just come up with ideas. There is an article about a tech company which has got five million in funding, and it is a really basic tech company. It's really simple. They build landing pages, basically. This company got five million in funding? I mean, we could build this company this week. We can clone it and compete against it. We could build this company tonight. I know. Let's build it. So for that week, we sat there in front of a whiteboard for the entire week. And then the very last day is like, well, what are we going to call it? What if we call it click funnels? That's it. Well, good hackathon, my friend. Yeah, it's always a pleasure. Look, the last couple of years I've been working with you kind of as an employee and doing some stuff. But this project, if I'm going to go all in, I want to be partners. It's so much fear and anxiety around that. And as I looked at him before he got in the car, I was just like, I felt this like weird calming feeling of just like, it's going to be OK. Let's be partners. All right. Sounds good. There he flew home to Atlanta, and he sat down in his basement office and spent the next three or four months building the first version of Click Funnels and the rest is history. It's interesting because I think about in any of our lives, there's a couple of key things. You pick a spouse. If you do good, it can be an amazing experience. If you pick the wrong spouse, it can be the hardest thing you've possibly experienced in this life. If you're picking a business partner, it's like a spouse. Because of that, I always had so much fear. And when everything collapsed and people started leaving, that was the first time I realized I'm like, oh, mostly people were here for paycheck. They weren't here because of the mission. I remember being so hurt by that. Outside of marrying my wife, it was a second-gray decision I ever made saying yes to all that day.
