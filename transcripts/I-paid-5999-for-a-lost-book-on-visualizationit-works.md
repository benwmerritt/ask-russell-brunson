This book I recently got off eBay for $5,999.99, but we had shipping and all that kind of stuff, eBay fees. It ended up being over $6,000. And some people might be wondering, why would you spend $6,000 on a book, Russell? First off, Neville is one of the most prolific writers from the genre that I like to collect in. He's got a huge cult following. And this edition of the book is actually really cool because first off is first edition, but number two, it was actually signed by Neville right here. So it's called The Power of Awareness. And he's got a lot of books in this series. We'll probably do other videos in the future and a lot of them. This is what I wanna lead with because again, it's first edition and signed by Neville. Oh, one of the concepts from this book that I think, and there's so many cool things in here to talk about awareness, mean aware of something, right? He talks about like most people aren't even, like they're not conscious of what's happening around them. Like most of us are living lives. We're just kind of out there, we're bouncing around and we're just doing whatever it is. We're not even aware of it. Talking about like the power, like when you're able to be aware of like this is what's happening, this is why I'm doing things, it changes things. For me, the very first time I had that, I was my very first Tony Robbins event. When everyone's at the event and we're jumping around and I remember this first time like I became aware of like what I was doing and why I was doing it. And the crazy thing was like, my whole life I've been doing this, I had these patterns that I was running, I didn't even know and this time I became aware of the pattern, I was able to stop back and be like, well, I keep doing the same thing over and over again. And when I was aware of it, then I could change it. But prior I couldn't, it was all invisible to me, right? And I think about like probably one of the greatest gifts that I got from Tony Robbins was being aware of the patterns that I was in, right? And a lot of this book is about that, like the power of awareness. When you're aware of something, then you can stop and you can change it versus most people are just drifting, they're just, they're living their life, they're not even aware of like, of the things that they're actually doing, right? One of the other really powerful things that I learned from Neville in this book he talks about, but also in other books I've read from him, that was really powerful. So the key to transformation is to think about the thing you want as if it's already happened, right? And it's not like, I think sometimes you see this in the self-help gurus, like, you know, if you wanna be rich, just tell people you're rich, you're rich, you're rich. And that's not what I'm talking about here. In fact, I have a really cool example of my own life. Over the last, man, two, two and a half years, I've really struggled to sleep at night. So I've had sleep issues. And the reason that I have so many projects I'm working on, stress and anxiety, the business and chaos with kids and all this stuff. And so happened I go to bed at night and as I'm going to bed at night, I start thinking about the obstacles, right? Like one, I'll fall, I'll be falling asleep and all of a sudden think about one obstacle in my way. Right? All of a sudden I think about that, like, oh, so my brain starts trying to figure out how to solve that. I'm trying to think about that. And all of a sudden the next obstacle pops up, another one, and soon I'm like, I'm stressing about 12 different projects and I can't sleep at night next to no, it's five in the morning, my alarm clock's going off, I haven't slept yet and it's like, and I really struggled that long time. And then I started 75 hard about 40 days ago and I was reading a Neville Goddard book. And in there he talked about, before you go to bed at night, he said, don't focus on the obstacles in your head. He said, instead, visualize the end state of what you want to accomplish, what you're working towards. He said, if you do that, a couple things happen. Number one, you'll be able to fall asleep better, which I was like, oh, I think heaven's, I could use that right now in my life. But number two, he said, when you do that, he's like your subconscious mind, if you visualize what you're trying to get to, your subconscious mind when you're sleeping will figure out all the things to answer and then be able to solve that problem. He said, when you're stressing about and thinking about the problems you have, your brain will make those problems bigger, which why you can't sleep at night. But if you visualize the end state, so for me, for example, what I was doing, right now a lot of you guys probably know, like right now I'm in my makeshift version of my vault. I am building a 20,000 square foot museum for my books, my magazines, my manuscripts, everything, right? And this has been a big project for the last two or three years and so for me, I was stressing about all the details of everything and I remember stopping it after reading this from Neville and I said, okay, tonight when I go to bed, I'm just gonna think about the end state. So I pictured myself like in the museum events center. I pictured myself on stage with like my inner circle members in there, I'm teaching them stuff and we're having a great time. And I've visualized myself like in the room with the books. I see them researching and writing, like writing my next book and like the end state of like the angle that I'm racing towards, right? And I remember I did that the first night and within five minutes I was out cold. And the next day I was like, I slept great last night, right? And then the next day I say, when I go to bed tonight, I'm gonna visualize the end state. Visualize the end state, right? And then fell asleep. So I was falling asleep really good. But then the next byproduct, which is crazy, is just like he said, like your subconscious mind will figure out ways to solve these problems as you're sleeping. And when you're not in like conscious, like try to solve the problem zone, right? It's so crazy because like over the next 30 day window, like all of these like answers to the problems that for me to solve to the big division I was working towards started showing up in weird ways. Where like also like an idea, a person's head would pop in mine or a different situation or like these things would just come into my mind and they were the answer to how to solve the problems. And so I don't know, maybe it's, maybe it's, maybe it's super magic. I don't know, but two things it did for me is number one, make me sleep better night, which was a huge blessing. Number two, it's getting me closer to the thing I've been visualizing. And it's funny cause I hadn't done that for so long, but when I think back like in my athletic career as a kid, every night I went to bed and I visualized me as a state champion getting my hand raised. Like that was something every night I would think about. When I got to college, I started thinking about same thing that like, it was like my goals there. And I had forgotten about it. Like in athletics and sports, I think a lot of times we talk about visualization. You know, we hear about, you know, like basketball, like they did tests where, maximum alt's to test where they had basketball players who actually shot like a thousand free throws and then basketball players at night where like in their head, practiced a thousand free throws. And both groups increase their like, their scoring percentage by the same amount, whether they're doing it actually or just like visualizing it. You know, and so a lot of times in athletics, they look at tests like that and talk about athletes, like visualize yourself doing the thing. And, but we don't talk about in business, right? At least I never heard people talking about it. And I think a lot of us business people think we're too, that's too woo-woo for us. I'm not gonna try it. If it wasn't for someone like Neville, who I respect him as a writer and as an author, as someone who still has a huge cult following on online today, I wouldn't have tried it. And so far for me, it's been great. So there's your homework assignment for tonight. Visualize the end state of the thing you're trying to accomplish. And seed number one, it helps you sleep better at night. And number two, see if you do that consistently over time, if the answers to the problems you're trying to solve start magically showing up.
