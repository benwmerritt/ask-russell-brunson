I want to share with you what I think is the easiest secret to get people to give you money now or to register for your web classes or your Webinars or your courses or your challenges whatever it is You're trying to get people to do one of the number one questions I get over and over again in the comments is people who I can build a funnel they try to drive traffic and they're like hey I said people register for my webinar, but nobody showed up or I try to do live event Nobody showed up or I made an offer to sell them something and nobody actually bought it like what can I do rust to make it better? So I started thinking about it I found a couple of really cool things I want to share with you that I think that you can take and Immediately apply to any business to get people to buy more products to show up to the things you're trying to do and so on and so For the fact I've been testing this now for the last couple months with some insane results I'll show you actual application of it, but before I get there. I want to tell you guys a story Like you guys know Napoleon Hill is my favorite author here Let's put called thinking grow rich this book was actually published in 1937 but what a lot of people don't know is that 20 years before he wrote and published this book Napoleon Hill actually taught an advertising course literally 20 years early in fact I look at the Copyrights 1917 so he ran a course called truthful advertising at the George Washington Institute And this is the only known copy of the actual lesson plans everything of him teaching advertising Which I think is fascinating because you look at this he spent 20 years teaching and doing advertising He was a copywriter he did all these kind of things and then when he came out with his product one day Because he knew copywriting he knew how to create offers he knew these things He's able to make thinking grow rich go and sell literally tens of millions of copies during his lifetime Which back then was way harder than nowadays this is before there's Amazon or bookstores This is all like through direct mail and things like that which is still blows my mind And so I started thinking like what did he know you're 20 years prior? What was he studying? What was he learning? So I've been going through this advertising course one thing that was my favorite is after you got done teaching advertising He actually decided to become a publisher He wanted to publish a magazine and some of you has heard of it Some you haven't he actually ended up publishing two magazines this lifetime the first one's called Hills golden rule I have been scouring the internet and I finally got a complete set of Hills golden rule magazine and this is it In fact, I'm gonna open up This is the case I built for it to not damage it because these are all like so old and amazing But this was a magazine he wrote and you look inside. This is the very first inaugural issue January 1919 and so this was the very first issue it says new magazine devoted to the interests of those who work for a living It was just kind of cool when you read through there's like a dozen different authors in here But I read his autobiography and found out that he couldn't afford other authors So every author in here for the first I think 16 months or 17 months of the magazine were just him he was the end he just used a different pen name So looked like there are a bunch of authors contributing with their all in the polling hill now think about this He's launching a magazine and he's trying to get this thing out to the world and so the first thing he's he's asking himself I'm sure as a as a marketers and advertisers like how do I advertise it? how do I get people to subscribe to a magazine and He created something that was so brilliant This is the first thing I want to share with you guys in these first issues he talked about he said every single month I'm gonna write an article in here called applied psychology teach you guys this philosophy of applied psychology So each month he started writing one article about it and it went through 12 lessons He was gonna do over the year when we got six months into the magazine. He's like this is really good People are loving this article on applied psychology He went out and he said hey what I'm gonna do right now if anybody subscribes to Hills Golden Rule magazine I'm gonna give you guys a book the only way to get this book is to subscribe the magazine I'll give you this book for free or you can buy it for $50 now $50 back in 1919 equivalent of like Things like $850 today So he created a premium sold it for $850 you could buy this book or you get for free when you subscribe to Hills Golden Rule magazine How cool is that and so he made booklet number one which was the first six? Lessons from the magazine in the next six months. He put together the next six articles made a second booklet I read about this booklet inside of all these magazines that I saw the ads he started putting ads in here like hey If you subscribe for a year, I'll give you these two books for free, but I couldn't find those books anywhere They were nowhere to be found online. I tried to talk to the Napoleon Hill Foundation They had heard of them, but they didn't have me there and so I've been scouring forever trying to find them and again these are the two premiums he used to get people to subscribe to Hills Golden Rule magazine and One here's something kind of cool. I about a year ago located the first booklet. I thought that was the only one I assumed he had never actually finished the second one, but about a week ago I found the second one on eBay and I got a huge bidding war against somebody and spent way more money That probably should have but I have acquired the two premiums that he used to get people on Hills Golden Rule magazine They're actually in my safe. Do you want to see him? So in here is the safe room where I put you know the most expensive the best the stuff That's the most rare and hard to find so this place catch on fire. I won't damage the book. So I'm gonna get in real quick All right, so here are the two You guys see these Okay, so for here is the first one It's called it will place you wherever you wish to be amongst men It's lessons in applied psychology and this book is old and it's falling apart This was the first premium and basically there is practical lessons in applied psychology by Napoleon Hill And it's series of six lessons reprinted from the January to July issues of Hills Golden Rule Furnace to paid-in-advanced subscribers They may have the entire series which runs through the year the booklet is not for sale can be secured only through your subscription It heals golden rule Okay, this course the lessons originally designed to sell for $50 which is crazy These are all of the different articles here from the first six months Again flash year. I've been sitting on this just realizing I discovered it. I found it so so cool Then on eBay it popped up one day just randomly and I don't think the person who owned it knew what it was But me and somebody else definitely did and we got in this huge bidding war and I Won so check this out. This is booklet number two It'll place you wherever you wish to be amongst men the great magic ladder to success Let me open this one When we start with the ladder to success right here And then less than seven to create magic ladder success It goes through the rest of them How cool is that? So there you go. These are the two premiums that a point he'll use Get people to subscribe to his newsletter. So this is part of the key premiums I want to understand why these are so important and we'll explain the rest of it when we get back there into the Napoleon Hill room How cool is that if any of you guys are subscribers to secrets of success? We are republishing those two booklets and you get it for free over secrets of success comm slash round pegs I'll put the link down in the description But if you want to actually read the first time ever they are actually in Reprinted book that we got the rights to reprint and you had access to it secrets of success comm slash round pegs Anyway, that's on a point hill That's what he used to get people to subscribe to his magazine again They would call it a premium back in the how do you attach a premium to something and nowadays we usually call stuff This bonus like how do you attach a bonus to get somebody to want to buy something right the key that most people understand? They create offers and they make bonuses they put together some random stuff and throw things together key with the bonus There's a lot of different things you can think about but you have to create a premium or bonus It's so good that it's better than the thing that you're selling already In fact one of my favorite stories about this if you ever remember watching infomercials or commercials in that in the 80s Sports Illustrated was a struggling magazine And they were trying to get off the ground trying to get people to subscribe It got to point where they were almost a bankruptcy and then somebody on the marketing team was a genius Maybe they read in point hills old advertising course or something But like we need to attach a premium they mean to attract something to this description They'll be more exciting than the actual subscription So they created an offer and some of you guys may have seen it before one of my friends Todd Hine actually sent me this after I told the story the first time this was the football phone that they sold back in the day So check this out if you remember the ad It's a phone call it looks like a football but works like a regular phone on off ringer mute button and automatic redial Hello Colleen. This is fantastic. I'm at the stadium right now. I have a Cute you said this is the football phone so to get people to subscribe to sports illustrated wasn't like hey buyer subscription buyer subscription I was like here's a premium that's so good You want it anyway, but the only way to get the premium is to subscribe to the actual newsletter, right? Same thing sports illustrated the only way to get the football phone. Can you mad? Do you remember talking to this? Hello? We should make a football iPhone anyway The only way to get this amazing phone was to subscribe to sports illustrated. So that's the power of a premium now. I want to share For all you guys just to think through this in your business, right? Now obviously we talk about bonuses and things like that But this is if you position your head as a premium it's different than a bonus, right? For example, one of the things we've been doing recently is when somebody registers for our web classes, right? We do a webinar a challenge Well hardest things do is to get people to actually show up right how many of us run webinars or web classes? You may go and spend a bunch of money ads to get people to register So you register a thousand people to come to any webinars then you only get like 15 20% show up So of the thousand people you may have spent three or four dollars a lead on Facebook right spent three or four thousand dollars But only 150 people actually show up right maybe get a hundred people to register only 15 show up like It's hard to make the math and the metrics work right? So how do you get more people to show up one of my inner circle members Tim Shields? I saw him doing this on his webinars Now Tim's in the photography market and if you're on his email list you notice every single week He promotes a web class he's gonna be teaching. He doesn't just promote the web class He attaches a premium when you watch to the end you're going to get my brand new collection of sunrise cheat cards I saw him doing this over and over and over again. I know that he had won our two Commonwealth of X award I know his business is doing really really well But I'm gonna try to attach a premium to my webinars as well And so we did two versions of a webinar at salesfunnels.com and had two different premiums One of them was a swipe file booked people get for free when they registered and showed up for the web class How many of us want this swipe file? Oh, it's amazing The second one was a booklet called funnel audibles They got for free when they registered and actually showed up. This is a gift you are going to love That was crazy about this is number one thing He did is he got way more people to actually register for the web class went from getting you know in a campaign Maybe we would have got three or four thousand people to register We got closer to eight and nine thousand people to register just because the premium was so good It's like Napoleon Hill you wanted that thing so bad that like they would go and subscribe to newsletter If you want the football phone so bad You would go and subscribe to newsletter because the premium is even better than the thing right for me It's like I'm trying to send the register for a 90 minute session with me right? It's right now. They're coming because the content they have to judge it's this content worth 90 minutes I don't know if it is or not and so to reward them I attach a premium. It's so powerful It's so good They're gonna want to register because even if they get no value from the 90 minutes with me They still get that premium at the end right and then at the very beginning of the webinar I told people I could said at the end of the web class. I'm gonna be giving you a link to this I'm gonna verbally give you the link at the end of the presentation So that means you have to stay on the entire thing and then we give you into your verbally You have to actually be on the web class and to stay on you don't know when it's gonna happen But it's gonna be coming so you have to make sure you stay on I'm gonna verbally give it to you So people's got on there and then they sat there listening They didn't sign up at all. He's gonna email me the premium They knew the only way to get it is to be live and I was gonna tell them the link to download the premium I mentioned the very beginning of the web class when first I started ten minutes And I get mentioned again and then went through the entire training and then before I made my special offer I reminded them that when I'm done the odd telling you about the offer I'm gonna give you guys access to this premium then I went through did the stack in the clothes So sign people up on my course and then often the premium at the end and when all said and done the numbers is by attaching a premium to this Online webinar that we did we got way more people to register at lower cost way more people to show up way more people to stick To the end stick through the clothes and then there's better reciprocity because the end of it whether they bother They didn't they left us something valuable to end the event and so that's just one way to attach a premium Right to a webinar you know the webinar with a challenge with a live event however you're doing it It's a great powerful way to get people to show up now Second way you can use the premiums the same way that Napoleon Hill is using it the same way sports illustrator using which is actually a time The premium to getting them to buy something from you for example as I mentioned earlier I do have a membership site called secrets of success It's a 97-dollar month membership site where I go and I show people I give access to people of these old books and manuscripts and Audio recordings and things like that and that we have book clubs and mastermind It's a really cool program, but to get people in there I don't say hey sign up for 97 dollars a month instead. I created really cool premium And it was my premium. I told you part of it right now number one I give people free copy the book thinking girl rich number two I give them a copy of the premium from Hills Golden Rule magazine right the lessons on applied psychology I put that into a book They get a physical copy of that as well and number three I give them another unpublished book from Napoleon Hill called the secrets of master salesmanship right I put all three those things together Into a box that I shipped out for free when they subscribe to the membership site that premium has added thousands and thousands and thousands of people To our continuity program so the key is how do you create a premium? It's so good to get people to actually show up to your live trainings They'll actually get people to register for your Facebook groups right that'll get people to actually sound for your membership sites or your courses Or whatever thing might be stop thinking about like what are the bonuses I can throw in to get people it you know to make the offer better Instead they're thinking what's the premium? It's so good. It's more valuable than the actual thing I'm selling so when they see that and you drop like here's where you're gonna get their minds blown like I have to Have to give you money have to be part of this right and so start thinking about the premiums You can create since the highest weight increase your sales get more people to show up and to change your business forever So if you learn one thing we're in point hill today, that is to create premiums inside of your business and for all of your offers
