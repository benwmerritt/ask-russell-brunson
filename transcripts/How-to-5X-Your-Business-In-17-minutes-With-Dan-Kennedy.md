So when you're acquiring a new company and you want to announce and you could go and send an email or you could write a blog post, but if you did, but you get a reaction like this, I want to officially announce the acquisition ClickFunnels is just acquired Magnetic Marketing, Dan Kennedy's company. So you saw the last video in the series that you saw who Dan Kennedy is, but you also saw why we decided to acquire his company. Now a lot of my audience knew who Dan Kennedy was. A lot of them didn't and honestly, a lot of them thought he was dead. I mean, it's been years since he's been on stage, since people have actually seen him. So instead of having people hear about him, we wanted them to actually hear from him. So it's nice of them all to be so excited because Frank Cronin is still thoroughly pissed off that we ruined his story. And I ruined his story by not dying. He clung to the idea that I was dead for quite some time. So thank you. It's very nice of you. Well, I'm excited. First off, to introduce you to our people. Like you guys have no idea how much this man has impacted your lives indirectly and a lot of you guys directly as well. And this is my huge honor to have a chance to interview you. I'm not going to lie, I'm kind of nervous, but I'm also excited. And we're going to talk about funnels and some of the fatal flaws that a lot of us as internet marketers have when we're focusing on our funnels. But before we got into the funnel stuff, I had a personal question I wanted to ask just because I know like where I got my start and Frank Cronin and Ryan Dyson, how some of people all come back and basically say I got my start from Dan Kennedy, but I'm curious how you got started in this. I made it all up. I had a brief sojourn in normal traditional advertising and quickly determined that it was 90% bullshit. That the agency agenda and the client agenda were not very well synced. I had an agency owner say to me, kid, what you want is a dog food company as a client owned by a rich old guy who's married to the third wife half his age. And she has five fluffy poodles because all you got to do is put effin poodle in the ad and you'll keep the client for two years because they have no earthly idea whether what we're doing works or not. And it was about that day that I said, you know, I don't really know if I want to be a part of this. You know, there's more honorable ways to make a living. You could be a lawyer or a politician or... So I began to really pay attention to mail order. Now here's how to order. COD and credit card orders. Call this toll free number to order. That's 1-800-1800. 1-800-453-1400. I studied the masters of mail order. And then more on sort of the success side of things which you are personally fascinated with. I know sort of the history of personal development and success philosophy. Magnetism is also a real thing. A pull rather than a push. So that your ideal prospects are chasing you rather than you chasing them. So that's sort of the history. That actually, interesting enough, leads to our first real question. This one was interesting for me because when I first started my business, I built a funnel. I started driving people to it. I started making sales and I was making money. But I remember one day, probably a year or two into the business, waking up and laying in bed and being like so miserable because I hated my customers. I remember sitting there thinking, I wish that I had a boss so they could fire me because I don't want to go in and have to do my customer support and talk to my, I just had the wrong customers. I think a lot of times because it's so easy nowadays to build a funnel and start getting traffic, we build this amazing funnel but then we get the wrong prospects and wrong people in. More than half has to do with the audience that you've selected. And if you've selected really well, mediocre marketing will often get extraordinary results. The most important principle about magnetic marketing is what I've always described as message to market match. And the tighter that match is, you know, John Carlton's story about the ad campaign for the one-legged left-handed golfer, right? Well, if you can get that in front of a one-legged left-handed golfer, see, that's a slam dunk. Message to market match is what, is where we find magnetism. So like I've always understood their audiences that are no good for me, okay? And I'm no good for them either, corporate. We are not, you know, gonna sink. And there's no point in me trying to make that happen because there's a lot of people with whom I'm like the perfect match. So why not find them, right? The key to this is sort of source, where are they coming from, and who are they? There's subsets of every audience and every market, and the tighter the match, the better. So like if you have orthodontists who run ads about Invisalign and ad drives them to the orthodontist website, but that's a generic website about everything the orthodontist does, the person who went there thinking Invisalign, Invisalign, Invisalign is instantly disappointed. Oh crap, it's just another orthodontist, and off they go. The orthodontist, if he wants to do dentures, he's gotta have a complete marketing system for dentures, a complete marketing system for Invisalign, and never the tube shall meet, right? Can you give a round of applause for that? That actually reminds me of one of the stories, I think you wrote about it in the Ultimate Sales Letter, I think, and you talked the story about the welcome guest versus annoying pest. Would you really tell that story, because I think it kind of ties into that, and the marketing messages that people are... Yeah, so people show up as annoying pests precisely because they don't get message to market match going in, right? So it was a weekday, middle of the day, we had big wood double doors, and there's this monstrous banging, and I'm busy, I think I was on the phone, so I ignore it, confident that if you ignore a pest, generally it will go away. So this goes on for a while, but I'm pretty stubborn, so I can ignore a lot. Next thing I know, this person has climbed over the back wall of my property, which by the way has shards of glass on top of them to discourage this idea, and they are now banging on the sliding glass door, which they can see me through. So now you're kind of a, you know, if you don't, so okay. So the message is, all of the shrubbery in your front yard is on fire. Now at that second in time, he went from being a most annoying pest to a most welcome guest, and the only thing that changed was right message, right time, right? That's it. The next question I have for you, and it's funny because I quoted you in all my books saying this, and then I think three times in the last two days I've quoted you, this is like my, the quote that had the probably the biggest impact, whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins. And especially in our world right now, I don't know how much you follow, like the recent like Facebook and Apple fights, like cost to acquire customers has gone up across the internet. And I think that it's headed towards like real acquisition. But I love because I think people in this room are good at making good fun of a lot of times the economics don't work at the end of the day. I love you talk a little bit more about that. Yeah. So, so math is the gravity of the direct marketing business. Marketing is about behavioral psych and math. And most people love the behavioral psych part and they hate the math part. And they were often trying to overcome bad math with some compensating idea. I've got a product that the whole world needs. I've got the best doodad ever invented. I've got the best copywriter that's ever walked the face of the earth, etc. etc. etc. Nothing overcomes bad economics. Nothing ever. It has to do with cost per lead. It has to do with cost per sale. First of all, in any competitive environment, whoever figures out how to spend the most for their lead and their sale wins. They buy speed, they buy scale, discouragement of competition, and they buy sustainability. When I started working in the infomercial business, TV stations still didn't understand what we were doing. In a local market, you could buy all the half hours you wanted from midnight until eight in the morning. So when we walked in and said, well, buy that dead time, the station guy says, what do you give us for it? How about 200 bucks? Station guy says to himself, these people are crazy, right? Will you agree to do it for six weeks? Sure. Great. Here. Here's the keys to the building. You come in, flip the switch, you know. Well, you could have some pretty crappy marketing and you could win. The following is a paid program announcement. Because if you saw one course, you were home free. Well, five years later, that half hour is $20,000. Well, now you got to get good, right? Now you've got to like figure out a business. You've got to be able to mitigate that cost. You can't miss any opportunity for money, right? But if you do, you win big because like everybody else, kind of surrenders. So the first truth about all this is there really is no bad number. Once you get a number and you know what it is, your challenge now is how do I bridge the gap to a number I can afford and then go out and acquire all the good customers I want if I can figure out that formula. So you can have the best funnel in the world, but if you got bad math and you don't do something about that math, you're going to get bit. All right. Next question I have for you. I've gone through, I think, every course and book you've written and I think the one that had them. What a bet. Give me your credit card before you. But one of my favorites still to this day that I've probably gone through a dozen times or more was the, it was an event you did called personality and copy and it was talking about weaving these things in and for me, like when I started my business, I was very introverted and shy and I didn't talk about myself or my audience or anything and as I went through that course, you talked about companies like Marvel and you talked about Disney and all these companies that brought their personality into their marketing and brought their built entire universes around what they were doing. I'd love for you to talk more about some of those principles. I think people here can really start weaving. Well, so me too, by the way. So I'm an introvert. I'm not an extrovert. I'm happiest in the basement writing, but it turns out that building an institutional business, a nameless, faceless, devoid of personality business is much harder because people like to do business with people that they know, like admire, respect, trust and feel affinity to and you can't do that when it's XYZ company. The three that probably have had the most influence as models for me were Walt Disney, Stanley, who built Marvel, of course, and Hugh Hefner. And by the way, they're all of the same era. They all watched each other. They all knew each other and there's enormous similarities. You know, Walt had mice and ducks and have to have rabbits. But so one is personality. The other lesson of all three of those people, which I think is very important to the person who thinks of themselves as a digital or an online marketer, is that they each created a place to put their customers in a world of their own, apart from the rest of the world. After all, we said if Walt hadn't got it first, he would have said happiest place on earth. I mean, really, you know. And so Stanley did that brilliantly. He's the first guy ever. There was a rule in comic books that you never acknowledged to the reader that any of this wasn't real. And Stan broke that rule to Smithereens and let everybody in on the gag. And the fans not only knew the characters, they knew the artists, they knew the writers. There was a column in almost every Marvel comic book called Stan's Bullpen, where they talked about what Jack Kirby was doing on his vacation and what the next storyline was going to be. And it was all kind of written tongue in cheek, teen kind of lingo. But we were in the Marvel world. Kids badgered their parents to take them to the Marvel offices in New York so they could see the bullpen where all the writers worked. So what all three of those guys did just brilliantly is they took their customers, they organized them as a group, and they put them in a world of their own with media they owned and controlled. For them, it is the happiest place on earth or it is the most exciting place on earth. Hopefully it's the most profitable. But anyway, you don't get free, rich, or secure by what you do. You get it by what you own. So wealth comes from what you own and freedom comes from what you own and security comes from what you own. And the hardest asset to lose is you, your personality, your mindset, your knowledge, your skill set. Okay, so my last question for you. In a lot of businesses, people are doing things, especially I think online even more so, like they're moving forward, they're doing a lot of stuff and they're leaving a ton of money behind, leaving piles of cash. They're not thinking through just different ways to make sure they're not leaving money behind. I love some of your thoughts. I know we could go deep on this for days, but just for people in our audience, how to make sure they don't do that? Well, the plugaboo. I have a book about this called Almost Alchemy, More from Fewer and Less. And what you can't afford, either because of rising costs of acquisition, or because you want maximum power in the marketplace, or both, is you can't afford to accidentally or unknowingly leave money behind. Well, there's all these leaks internally and externally in a business, typical chiropractic office. They let the front desk staff go to lunch together and put the phones on voicemail. You go, no, no, you don't want voicemail in the middle of the day when you have three staff people you're paying. No, you take turns going to lunch. So there's always somebody, that's the bare minimums. But if that's all you do, you increase gross revenue by 20%. That's how much is being lost, just by that. So if you run around a business and you find five of those, you double the business. If you can find five internal and five external, you double double. Oh, well, thank you, thank you very much. Thank you very much. It's very kind of you. Good day to you. He was out of a cloth. Stand up. Thank you, thank you, guys.
