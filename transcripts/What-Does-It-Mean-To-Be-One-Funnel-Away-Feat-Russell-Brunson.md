I think most people get stuck with the belief of like, I believe it works for Russell or something but I don't think I can do it. Yeah. And I was the other way around like I saw other people doing it. I was like, I remember names Armand Moore and Alex Mendoza, Marlin Sanders like Yonix Silver, these are the guys who I was watching. I'm like, they're doing it. Right. And I was like, they're really cool guys. There's no way that I'm smarter than me. Right. So I just had a perfect belief like I'm going to figure it out. And so it was like, okay, I'm just going to keep trying to what works. Okay. Nothing else going on. So I'm trying this one and this one and this one and this one and and what's crazy. The first couple to do well, but then as soon as it's, as soon as you have one has a little bit of success, the next one you do has like because you're getting customers, I see some customers. Right. And then I remember my very one of my other big ones. My very first software product is called Zip Brand. It's my first product in the internet. Yeah. The marketing word Zip Brander. And it didn't do awesome, but like it was my first big idea and it made a couple hundred bucks. And then I remember I had this idea for a product called foreign fortunes. I found a program, I coded it and then I took my little customer list and I promoted foreign fortunes. I remember having my first thousand dollar a day. I was like, $1,000 a freaking out. Like that's more than I made it like multiple months before thousand dollar a day. And then the next idea was actually was a horrible it was so stupid, but it was called article spider. And I was like, I paid a guy a couple hundred bucks, made this thing called article spider. And then I watched that and then when I had a $1,700 a day, I was like, what? And like everything's really got better and better. I think sometimes people think one funnel way means I'm gonna like million dollars. Nothing, nothing, nothing. And that happens sometimes. Like train well, right? Yeah. Nothing, nothing, nothing, $20 million in six weeks. Like, but that's rare. Right. It's usually it's like each one's a stepping stone to the next thing. And the next thing is like, it just cuts growing. And eventually like, if you keep doing it, like you have customers and people that eventually like your list get big enough where it's like, I was helping people like pushing a rock up a hill, right? And then you get the top that it comes back down, boom, the other side and it starts, it starts growing. So it's just, it's just having fun and believing that that you can actually do it. And then not being so stressed out. They're like, Oh, this is, you know, I'm gonna be successful. It's like, no, like, like keep your day job. Do some inside while you're doing it. Right. So you're not stressed out about money and finances and keep doing, have some fun with it and be creative. And then eventually, like, if you keep consistent with the long enough, eventually it's gonna work.
