When I got done wrestling, I didn't work out for like eight years. I gained a bunch of weight and I didn't believe that it affected performance. You know that the brain fog you get sometimes? I used to get it all the time. Like when I started to try to get back in shape, lost some weight, and it's amazing how much clearer things were. Like easier to focus. The more your body's running optimally, the more your mind runs optimally. It was interesting, Alex Sharfinn talked about this. He said, if you had a million dollar racehorse, like what would you do with it? Like, oh, you feed it the best food, give it the best supplements, you would take care of it, all these kind of things. And it's like, so then how can you who are running a multi-million dollar business, why don't you treat yourself like a racehorse? If you want to be in peak performance all the time, it's not just your mind, it's your body. They go hand in hand. You want the truth? The truth is, huge believer in having a trainer. Many times when I come to gym and just basically look at weights and do nothing. And having a trainer actually keeps you accountable. You just have to have a coach in life in every aspect. This right here, this is Mark Schultz and he was my wrestling coach at BYU. My roommate and I were sitting in our dorm room and also we heard this knock on the door. We opened the door and it's Coach Schultz. He's an Olympic champ. He went to the UFC, probably one of the toughest human beings on this planet. Too much blood, even for the rest. He hands me this VHS videotapes, his total violence on it. He's like, this is all my best wrestling that moves. He's like, watch this every day and you'll become a better wrestler. I was like, okay, wait, wait, hold on. Go get your wallet. Hand it to me, opens it up, looks at my money, takes it all out of his wallet, puts it in his pocket and hands him back an empty wallet. Coach, what's going on? Why did you take my money? And he's like, I'm going to teach you a lesson right now that'll serve you for the rest of your life. He's like, if I gave you that tape, he's like, you'd never watch it. Like, but now you've invested everything you have, all the money you have in it. Because you invested everything, he's like, you're going to use it, you're going to watch it, you're going to pay attention, you'll become a better wrestler because of it. I learned the moves, I became a better wrestler all because I invested in my education. So as soon as we get them lifting today, we're going to go cryos on and freeze because that'll get our brain optimal performance. All right, so what's going to happen? We turned it on. It's going to drop to about negative 140 degrees Celsius. Jesus, it's so cold. The entire team will fill up with liquid nitrogen. Jump in and you stay for about three minutes. It feels like we're sitting on an iceberg. Now for men, is this going to cause permanent shrinkage of them? And then after that, we'll be heading in. The team's already there early this morning getting everything set up. They're setting up a natural telephone. But if you have never gone through the experience of paying for information, how can you sell the idea someone should pay for information? And I found that if they've never done it, I don't want them to speak. The obstacle's too hard for me to overcome. But if someone has said, yeah, I took every penny and every dollar in my wallet to get information I needed, when you told me that story a while ago, it resonated with me. That's exactly why you're good at this. Because you know what it feels like to give up everything in your wallet to get something that you know is going to make a difference to you. Yeah, I think of all the things that we do, I think FunLocking Live is probably the most important, most valuable thing that we produce and we put on. Costs us over a million dollars to put on the event. And I want every entrepreneur to be there. But the problem is it's also of everything we sell, it's by far the hardest thing to sell. You think about software information products, like it's like an impulse buy, right? With this, it's not an impulse buy because someone's got to go and they have to get work off. And they've convinced their spouse and they have to find babysitters for their kids. And they've got to flights and hotels. And tickets are selling really, really well and consistently. But we need to do some big things to sell tickets. We had a meeting probably two weeks ago and we were just like, okay, what can we do to sell tickets? And we were just brainstorming a bunch of ideas. And all of a sudden in my head, I have no idea how it popped in my head, but I started remembering PBS and the old telephones that I used to watch as a little kid. They show you a movie like Wizard of Oz and so the whole family watching the Wizard of Oz in the middle of it would stop and they're like, hey, really quick for you to keep watching the show. The way we are able to stay on the TV as a network is we raise funds and they had the host and behind the host is all these people who were taking calls and they call this number and donate some money to keep us on air. And all of a sudden it's like, what if we did a telethon? I don't know, what if we just did a fun show? I just tell stories and then we got people behind me answering calls and we try to get people to call in. And then like, what are we doing? We're like, oh, in a week and a half from now. This is one of those things that could be like the most brilliant marketing idea in the history of marketing. So we know it or it could be the biggest trade in the world. Five, four, three, two, one, we're live. We're actually live. We're live. Ah, we're live. What's up everybody? We're welcome to our first ever and maybe last ever, we'll find out afterwards. ClickFunnels Telethon. Basically what's going to be happening is over the next couple of hours, I'm going to be telling you guys a ton of stories walking you through over 150 plus funnels we launched before ClickFunnels A came out. Maybe wonder what the world will do, this is why we're doing so. What's happening is today, I feel like I have a moral obligation to everybody here who's watching this. To make sure you guys come to Funnel Hacking Live. I'm going to be bribing you guys with insane amounts of bonuses and prizes today. To make sure you come to Funnel Hacking Live. So you can get to see them by going to FunnelHackingLive.com or call these guys right here. 1-877-222-3959, give us a call and let's keep this Funnel Hacking Live for you and your family, your teams and everything. I love going back to the old marketing stuff. It's what no one else is doing these days. Everyone think they've forgotten it like it doesn't work. The reason it actually works twice as well today is because it worked well then and there's no competition. No one else is doing it. Funnel Hacking Telethon, this is Miles. How many tickets would you like? Oh, how do I answer? Oh, this is not a good start. Pick up the phone. Oh my gosh, the first phone call just came in. Hey, this is Russell. This is Russell Grant Cardone, buddy. Yeah, I love your Telethon, man. Thank you, we're in old school. So Grant has his Big 10X event and so this year he wanted to go even bigger. So it's in a baseball stadium in Miami. He's got supposed to be 35,000 people coming at it and we bought 1000 seats. And so we're going to have all of our community come and use those seats so we can have a big Funnel Hacker party. I can't think of anybody to partner with better than you, Russell. I mean, I love you. I love your organization. You guys do what you say you're going to do. You deliver a great product. So that's the kind of people we want to align ourselves with. Keep hacking the world, bro. All right, thanks man. Appreciate you. Anyone who buys today is going to get a special seat at 10X event. Just sit with all the Funnel Hackers and then Dave, I've been told we need to give away a prize right now for the next person who buys. Dave shows up and he has this money suit, money tie. And he's, I haven't helped him go out of prizes. We're going to randomly give away the coveted ClickFunnels backpacks, the Blue Yeti Mike, how to MacBooks, all of the notes for the years of Funnel Hacking Live in the past. The only way to get them is by a ticket. One of the most biggest requests they're getting right now is for me to give away the suit. Oh, I want the suit. Who wants the suit? I want the suit. Josh, look at that beautiful purple lining, huh? My biggest fear, honestly, was that I was going to rip out the seat of the pants because they were so tight. Josh, who's our winner? The winner of the money suit. Kevin Hoff. Kevin Hoff! You are so lucky! This is on its way to you, baby! 877-222-3959! Hold the number now! Like, yesterday he messaged me afterwards and his voice was wrecked. Like, we got the Smokers' Golf going on here and I've never smoked at all, so I don't know what's happened. For me, it's less of like just modeling exactly, but looking at a lot of things and then taking all those things together and blending them into like a new idea. And so, like, we saw PBS Telethon. We do webinars all the time, so it's like, it's partially a webinar pitch, but it's also like, the infomercial, like, watch the infomercial. You know, people are flipping the channels all the time, so infomercials, for like a 26 and a half minute infomercial, they will repeat the call to action three times. And this is the same thing, it's like, it's in people's Facebook feeds, they're YouTube feeds, we've no idea what they're jumping in. So we have to make the entire sales argument every about 10 minutes, we start from the beginning and retell it, like hook people in, get them excited, tell them to have the sales again. So that kept happening. So it's kind of taking a lot of those different selling systems and blending them into the Telethon that turned out the way it did. So if you haven't got your tickets yet, go to funnelhackinglive.com or call these guys right now. And that's the whole game of marketing, right? It's like hook story offering and then grab them and then get attention and long enough to be able to make your message. So I already showed you guys the video from our very first funnel hacking live ever where we had 600 people. The second funnel hacking live is where we had 1200 people there. Third one was in Dallas, 1500 people, and this was the first year that Tony Robbins came. This is from our last funnel hacking live where we raised over a million dollars for Operation Underground Railroad. This couldn't have happened without ClickFunnels. Thank you guys so much. And so when you watch this, I want you guys to again visualize yourself sitting in the room, visualize the conversation that happened, the things that... Either you did experience, if you were there, things you could have experienced, had you been a fly on the wall. And then when you think about it, man, should I be in the next one? Should I be there? And realize you need to be in the room. I promise you guys it will change your perspective, it will change your belief patterns, it will change all the things that are holding you back. It will rip those things away so you can finally run forward and do what you're supposed to do and serve the way you're supposed to serve and make the money you're supposed to make. But next year I'm coming in hot. I'm gonna be practicing all year. Double phone. You guys just ran it. We sold about 136 tickets so far, which is awesome. Yeah, so it's weird because we had no idea what... Like, it was like, what's the goal? Like, I don't know. Let's say 100 or 500, and we have no idea. I think when we left last night, it was like 160 or so tickets have been sold. Which one thing is exciting, but the second thing is by the time I left yesterday, over 17,000 people had viewed the telethon, which is cool because that means 17,000 people who didn't buy are the ones right now like talking to their spouse, talking to their kids, trying to see the dates will work, trying to get work off. And so it'll linger for the next probably, you know, three or four weeks afterwards. We'll see a rise in sales that will continue to happen. And then now that it's done and it's live on Facebook and on YouTube, now we're buying ads to it. So people continue to keep seeing this for the next couple weeks. And my guess when I'll send them, we'll probably sell 500 or 600 tickets from the telethon. Thank you everyone for making that a possibility. That was insanely cool. I can barely breathe. I'm talking right now, but that was like the coolest thing to experience ever.
