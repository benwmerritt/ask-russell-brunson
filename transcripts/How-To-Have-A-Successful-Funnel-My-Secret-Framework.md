Failing companies have leaky funnels, and this book is the secret to fixing those leaky funnels. This is one of my favorite books, I'm on my favorite author, because this book was written by me, it's called Dotcom Secrets. Now this book has literally become the bible on how to build sales funnels that grow your business, but today I'm gonna share with you three secrets from this book, and these are the exact same secrets that I tell people when they pay me $100,000 and fly to Boise, Idaho for a one day console. So you're gonna get the shortcut to success by paying attention to today's YouTube video. Let's go to the whiteboard, and let's talk about Dotcom Secrets. So this is my favorite book because I spent a decade of my life touring around the country and literally around the world teaching these principles, and after teaching it for 10 years, I was like, I wanna put this down so I can actually share it. So it became the very first book I ever wrote, it's gone on to sell literally over 350,000 copies, and I'm really proud of this book because of it. It is the book that kind of launched the funnel movement online, it taught people about the core concepts and principles of funnels that everybody uses today in their online businesses. There are a lot of things in this book, but there's three things that I think are the most important. So the first one is actually in chapter one, it's called the Secret Formula, and when I was writing the book, I was trying to figure out like, how do I explain to people why funnels are so important, how they work, and what's the overarching concept? So let me show you what the Secret Formula looks like. The first step in the Secret Formula is figuring out your who. Now for this, I just drew a picture of a fish, it's not the best fish ever, but it's a pretty good fish, right? The first thing you have to ask yourself when you're trying to build a sales funnel and grow your company is who is your dream customer? And this is what most people do wrong. Most people, when they start a business, they start like a product-centric business. They create a product and they try to figure out who to sell it to. And for me, that's how I started my journey 20 years ago as well. I started creating a bunch of products, started selling them, and guess what? Without even thinking about it, I started attracting the wrong customers. And after about a year in my business, I realized I didn't like my customer. In fact, I hated my customers. I remember waking up every morning being sick to my stomach. And I talk about it in the book, one day I woke up and I remember laying in bed thinking, I wish I had a boss that could fire me. I do not want to go see my customers, I don't want to talk to them, and I didn't know what to do. I was so overwhelmed. And a little while later, I started thinking about this. In fact, it was about New Year's. I remember Tony Robbins and his wife, Sage, put out this video and they said, hey, it's New Year's right now. And New Year's is the time for change. You can change anytime you want, but New Year's is a great time. And if you're not happy in your relationship, you should change it. If you're not happy with your health, change it. If you're not happy with your business, you should change it. And when Tony said that, I was like, I'm not happy with my business. I should change it. Who do I actually want to hang out? Like, who would be my dream customer? I would work with them for free because it would be so much fun and so fulfilling. And so step number one for me was like, who is my dream customer? So I changed it, got a different dream customer, it changed my life, changed my business. Now I wake up every single day, pumped to hang out with the people I get to serve. Step number two, question number two is where? Okay. Where are these people congregating? I'm gonna draw a picture of a lake and there's gonna be a whole bunch of fish in here, right? Okay. So that's the second question, is where are these people congregating? Now I use the word congregation on purpose. When you hear the word congregation, what do you typically think? Type down in the comments down below. What does congregation mean for most of you guys? Okay, for most people, congregation, people think of a church, right? It's like people are congregating together. So all the Catholics are congregating together on Sunday. All of the Baptists together, all the Mormons together. Like everyone's congregating together based on their beliefs and their values, right? Now if my dream customer, let's say my dream customers were Baptists and I wanted to sell something to them, where would I go find them? Were they all gonna be hanging out together every single Sunday in the same spot, right? I'd go to that congregation of people because they're already together and it'd be very easy for me to get my message out. Now really quick, I'm not telling you to go sell things at churches, that's not the goal. But conceptually, that's how the internet works. Everyone congregates together based on similar beliefs and values and things they love to talk about, right? And I really got this. My senior year at Boise State, I was a wrestler on the wrestling team. I remember student athletes, because we were not the smartest kids in the room a lot of times, we had a mandatory study hall. And so I get into wrestling practice, eat dinner, I had to come back for two hours every night to do mandatory study hall. And I remember sitting in study hall and for me, what I would do every single day is I would go to my favorite website at the time, it's no longer there, but it was called the mat.com. I'd go to the mat.com and on that site was every wrestler on the planet all talking about wrestling. Talking about what the match is coming up, who's gonna win, like their favorite moves, they all sorts of stuff, right? So every night at study hall, I'd be on the mat.com for hours just hanging out, talking with all the other wrestlers around the world. And remember one day I got up out of my chair, I was walking in the bathroom, I looked back, I noticed that like literally every single other wrestler in the study hall, they were all on the mat.com too. They're all hanging out. And I realized I was like, it's not just my university, it's every university in the country, it's every high school in the country, it's every school overseas, all the wrestlers on the planet are all hanging out in one spot, right? So my dream customers are wrestlers, where are they already congregating? They were all on one website. So if I wanted to get their attention, I could go and just put my ad and put my message out in front of them, right? Because they're already congregated together. Okay, so for you, if you know who your dream customer is, they're already been congregated together on Facebook groups, on blogs, on email lists, on podcasts, like they've already been congregated together. Okay, all right, that's step number two in the secret for me. Step number three, that's what I call bait. What is the bait that you were gonna put out there into the lake, into the congregation to grab those people and to pull them out? Okay, so the bait is like some kind of offer, so kind of advertising, something that's gonna go and grab them. Okay, I'm gonna go deeper on bait here in seconds. That's gonna be the second thing we'll talk about in the video, but the bait is the key to get that person to come in, okay? After you get the bait and you get the person, you get their attention, right? You grab their attention, then from there, then we're gonna take them to step number four, which is the result. What is the big result you're promising, right? So in the book, I have a picture of a mountain right here and there's this person up here, there's the result and the hole in the flag, right? So you're trying to take them up the mountain, all right? This is how you're gonna serve them long term when they come into your world, all right? So this is the very first thing I wanted to teach you guys from the DotCom Secrets book. Again, it's called the secret formula, okay? It's chapter one, literally. Secret number two, now this is my favorite framework in this entire book. In fact, this framework is so important, it's literally been in all my books. I publish DotCom Secrets, Expert Secrets, and Traffic Secrets because it's the one thing you have to have to be successful, okay? And what's funny is when people pay me $100,000 and they fly to Boise to have me consult with them, they always ask me questions like, okay, Russell, my funnel's not working, the ads aren't performing well, it's leaky, people are falling out like, how do I fix this? And the reality is the way I solve that problem 100% of the time is the same thing. It's always focusing on either the hook, the story, or the offer, okay? So that's the secret, second secret I want to teach you guys is hook story offer. And hook story offer for me, I tie it back here to bait, okay? So step number one is hook, okay? What is the hook we're using to grab somebody's attention? Okay, now we use the hook in a lot of different places, right? I always think about a hook, like if someone's at home and they're on their phone, and they're sitting on a couch and they're scrolling through Instagram or YouTube or whatever, right? Or maybe they're driving the car or whatever, right? But like, they're sitting there and they're just scrolling, right? So hook's job is to grab their attention, to hook their attention just long enough for you to tell them a story, okay? So hook is the key. And so for us, we're always doing these hooks. We're throwing these hooks out there to grab somebody's attention, okay? After we get their attention, right? When hook grabs your attention, it opens up just a little tiny gap for you now to insert your story, okay? So number one's hook, number two is story, okay? I stop their attention, I stop the scroll, I hook them, then I have a chance to tell them my story, right? I'm gonna tell them the story and then the goal of the story is to increase the perceived value of the thing I'm about to offer them, okay? That's step number three is the offer, okay? Hook's story offered. Now what's interesting is that it doesn't matter where in your funnel you're in. Again, if something's broken, it's always either the hook, the story, or the offer, okay? That seems simple, but literally people have been me a hundred-granded aid to fly out there, fly out here and ask me how to fix their funnels and this is, like, this is how it works, okay? We'll walk you through the process. Russell, my funnel's not working. Why do you think it's not working? I'm like, well, let's look at the ads. What's wrong with the ads? I don't know, it's not working. I'm like, well, is it the hook or the story they offer? They're like, well, maybe it's the hook. The hook's not that good. No one's really clicking on it. I'm like, yeah, okay, let's try making a new hook. We make some new hooks, right? And then that starts working and then we go to the landing page. Okay? Russell, why is the landing page not working? I'm like, I'm not sure. Look at it. It's either the hook, the story, the offer. Which one do you think it is? I'm like, well, the hook's good, but the offer's not that good. Why would someone give me their email address? The offer sucks. I'm like, yeah, well, maybe we should fix the offer, right? Then we go to the next page in the funnel. Okay, well, it's not working. What's wrong? Well, it's either the hook, the story, or the offer. And we literally go page by page, step by step, figuring out if it's the hook, the story, or the offer. It's always one of these three things. Does that make sense? Okay, that's why this is my favorite framework because it's literally the answer to every single question. If a funnel's leaking, if it's not working, if it's not converting, whatever it is, it's always either the hook, the story, or the offer. If you start looking at everything through that lens, you can figure out, it's one of these three things. You diagnose it, you fix it, and then boom, that's how your funnel to actually work. Okay? So I'm gonna go on to the third framework, which I'm gonna teach you guys here in a second, which is how to get your customers to give you a whole bunch more money. I wanna show you guys an example of hook story offer. Okay? So I'm gonna walk over here. This is actually an ad that we ran for my expert secrets book. And I'm gonna show you guys this one because this is one of my highest converting ads of all time. I want you to see how I've got a hook, a story, and an offer. Okay? Again, the hook's goal is that someone's scrolling through their phone, they grabs their attention just long enough, I can insert my story, and then the goal of the story is to increase the perceived value of the thing that I'm about to offer. So with that said, check out this video right here, showing a hook story offer with me selling the expert secrets book.

I cannot wait to ship you out your copy of the book. Thanks. All right, so there's an example of Hook's story offered. Now really quick, if I go too deep, I recommend you guys do not actually light your books on fire. It was a nightmare. We were soaking in gas, it's dripping down my arm as I'm lighting it, and trying to hope it's not gonna chase down. But you see how it works? You're scrolling, you see the book on fire, you stop. I what? You click the video, the button, also there's me telling a story about this book. It's gonna help you take your advice and turn it into money, and then make an offer. Go to expertssecrets.com and get a free copy. Hook's story offer. And that is the key, hook's story offer. So there's hook's story offer on the ad, there's hook's story offer on the landing page, there's hook's story offer on the upsell page, hook's story offer on the thank you page. There's always a hook's story on the offer at every single step inside the funnel, right? The email that comes up, right? The email, subject lines hook. Inside email there's a story. Then the email there's an offer. Like hook's story offers in every element of the business over and over and over again. And mastering this, seeing this, understanding how to make them better is the key to making sure your funnels aren't leaky, okay? All right, I got one last framework I wanna show you guys, and this is the framework that shows you how to make more money from every single customer. I learned this concept from Dan Kennedy. He said, whoever can spend the most money to acquire a customer wins, right? That's the key, that's how this game is played. And funnels give you the ability to outspend all of your competitors. Literally, when we launch ClickFunnels, we're competing against companies that had between 30 and $150 million in funding, and we had nothing. We had a credit card and that was about it, right? So the way that we won, we build funnels where the advertising cost was covered upfront by the funnel and it paid for the acquisition cost. And from there, we moved them up, what's called a value ladder. So the third thing I wanna teach you guys right now, and this is actually chapter number three here inside the .com Secrets Book when you have a chance to read it, is the value ladder. So this is how the concept of value ladder works, right? You got two different accesses here. You have price and then you have value, okay? So price and value. Now you think about this, when somebody first comes into your world, right? If you go and you take the thing that's like the most expensive, the highest value, let's say this is like the top tier, right? So let's say this is, let's say you have a coaching program for $100,000 or $50,000 or $25, right? This is the most expensive thing. So let's say 100K, right? And so you think about this, like the price is really high but the value is really high, right? And this would be like the thing I'd want to sell something, the best thing I possibly have. I could help some of this level more than anything else, right? But if I walk up to some stranger on the street and I'm like, hey, my name's Russell Brunson, I can help you build a funnel. This is the deal, if you give me $100,000, you can come to my office for one day, eight hours, and I'll help you build a funnel. Like we think most people would say, they're like, are you crazy? You look like you're 11 years old. Why in the world would I give you 100 grand? You're insane, right? And so because the reason why is because they're coming in here, I'm trying to offer this thing where the value's high and the price is high, but so far they don't have any relationship with me, right? So typically what happens when I'm doing this process, I got who, I got where, I throw out the bait, hookster offer, I bring them into my world. What I typically do, I bring them in at the bottom of my value ladder, right? Where the price is really low, but the value's also there. And what happens is they go through and they're gonna buy this first thing. So for example, it might be a free book, right? The free.com secrets book, the free expert secrets book. They buy the book, they get it, they receive value, like this is amazing, right? We receive value from somebody, what do you want? You naturally want more, right? So this is awesome, I want more. So then you can move them up the value ladder, now you can offer something with more value at a higher price. If you have a more expensive thing, right? They receive value, that's the value ladder, they'll keep going up and they'll keep going up all the way up until here, this becomes really easy, okay? Now what's cool about this is that every step in the value ladder, you increase the price, we also increase the relationship with that customer, okay? Now people will continue to buy from you until you either offend them or you stop offering them things to buy, okay? This is crazy. For me, I remember for a long time, my value ladder ended at 25,000, I was gonna have an inner circle at $25,000, and people bought there, I was like, this is crazy. And then a couple years later, I relaunched my inner circle at a higher price when I launched it at $50,000, and a whole bunch of people came up. Then I launched a category king program at $150,000 people, $150,000, and a whole bunch of people came up, then I launched my Atlas Group at 250 grand, even more people came up, right? And so what's crazy is that you have the value ladder, if you are giving value every single step, people will naturally wanna keep us setting up and up and up the value ladder, okay? It's similar like when I met my wife the very first time. Think about this in your dating situation, right? If I would have met my wife the very first day, say, hey, you are gorgeous, let's get married, have some kids, she would have freaked out, right? But that's what some of you guys do to your customers. Instead, I took her on a date, right? We had a good time on the date, this was a lot of fun. Like, hey, we'll try to go on a date again next week. She's like, yeah, I received value, that was fun, let's do it again. Next week I go on another date, right? Maybe here I hold her hand, right? I get a little more value, then here I give her a kiss. And eventually, we have the conversation like, hey, we should get married, have a bunch of kids. And she's like, that'd be amazing, right? But it happened because I took her up a value ladder. Okay, and the same thing is true with your customers. As you bring people in, you move them up the value ladder. And that's the key, right? The end goal is I wanna give them a result, right? All of you guys, my end goal is I wanna help you to build funnels to grow and scale your companies. Like, that's the end result I want. And there's different levels I can do that, right? But I bring people in down here, very simple, with a free book, right? If you're a reporter, free video, a webinar, a challenge, something that brings people in, I can give them value, and from there, remove them up the value ladder, okay? For me, guess what YouTube is? YouTube is literally at the front of my value ladder. You guys come in, you receive some value, you're like, this is awesome, I like Russell. I'm gonna go to his event, I'm gonna go to his challenge, I'm gonna go to whatever it is, right? Because we have this relationship, I provide value here, and you naturally want more, and that's how we move people up the value ladder till eventually, again, our highest level right now is $250,000. We do have a million dollar offer as well, so if you want that, eventually, it'll make sense for you. Right now, I gotta keep providing value, but eventually, a lot of you guys will be like, Russell, I'm gonna buy you a million dollar offer, it makes a lot of logical sense. So that is the game plan. So those are the three frameworks I wanna share with you guys, okay? The secret formula, who, where, bait, and result. Number two, with the bait, is hook story offer. Every single page in the front of hook story offer, hook story offer. After you bring those people in, now you're moving them up your value ladder from funnel number one to funnel number two to funnel number three, as you send them up your value ladder and build the better relationship with them. All right, come over here, I wanna share with you guys my evil motivation behind this video, this book, because I think if you understand it, it's gonna change your business as well. All right, here's my evil motivation. I want you guys to read this book. The reason why is because this is the beginning of my value ladder. If you read this book, you're gonna get so much value from it, it's gonna blow your mind. This book, literally, we launched it when we first launched ClickFunnels 10 years ago, and it changed the industry. I hope people understand how to use funnels to grow and scale their companies. It was the catalyst for the funnel movement of the last decade. Five years ago, I had a chance to rewrite, add in a whole bunch of really cool things for some of our clients and students who have been using funnels. Anyway, I'm very, very proud of it, and so I want you to get the free copy. There'll be a link in the description down below.
