## Transcript
I remember getting so upset. This is like the best stuff I have. Like this is people understood what they were getting. They would be blown away. But I remember looking in the audience and it was just like crickets. The man, Russell. Pay to sell your product. I love this guy. Love this guy. I honestly believe the Archbrewers are the only people that can actually change this planet. I wanna walk you guys through a process, okay? We're talking about frameworks. But a lot of times people are like, get the concept, okay? I'm gonna make it, build a framework. Step one, two, three. You kind of build a framework. But a lot of times it's like, well, how do I actually teach that framework? This is my framework for how to teach frameworks. And so I'm gonna walk you through this process right here. So this is kind of like one of those inception things like a dream inside of a dream, okay? All right, so the very first step in this framework for how to teach frameworks. Actually, before I tell you that step, I wanna tell you guys my very first mistake that I made when I first started doing this. And this is important for you because I guarantee you're gonna make the exact same mistake that I did. I spent about two years in the internet business learning how to start businesses and how to grow them online and how to scale them. And during that time, I became obsessed with the education side, like you guys are, right? And then one day I got a call from a friend and he said, hey, I'm doing this internet marketing seminar thing, do you wanna come teach what you do at it? Just come teach people what you do. And I was like, okay, so this is the picture of me and my very first internet marketing event. I was at this event teaching my framework. I remember getting out and saying, okay, hi everybody. And I was so awkward back then. I'm like, okay, let me teach you what I do. Step number one, I started teaching step number one. I teach step number two. But I remember thinking like, this is the best stuff I have. This is like, oh, if people understood what they were getting, they would be blown away. But I remember looking in the audience and it was just like crickets. I remember looking in the audience some guys asleep in the side, some of the ladies are like passed out. Like everyone's like talking and I was just like, they don't understand what I'm giving them? And my presentation got done. I was just like, that, that just didn't feel right. Like I don't think these people understood what was like, what was happening. But I tried my best and then I remember I got invited a couple of weeks later to another event. Someone invited me back and said, we wanna come teach again. I said, okay, this time they're gonna understand it. They're gonna moot. I'm gonna change their life. I'm so excited. I started teaching again. I was in like two or three steps down the bullet point. I looked and people were falling asleep, people walking out. I remember getting so upset. I mean, I've never felt this before. I remember I got so mad, I slammed my hand on the table and I ever kind of stopped. I said, do you guys understand what I went through to learn this stuff for you? Let me tell you, I started going through the story about how I learned and how I earned all the stuff. And as I tell this story, everyone's eyes get this big and they're all paying attention. And I was like, oh my gosh, I have their attention. And then I started teaching the framework. Everyone's taking notes and it shifted everything. And so instead of me just going and teaching the very first thing I did was actually the first step in the framework. I didn't just go and start teaching my framework. The first thing I did is I told them the story about how I learned it or I earned it. Now earned it means your experience. It's the things you went through and learned it means your knowledge. If you learned, you read, you studied, you figured out. You have to understand, you guys, without the story, nobody's gonna buy into your strategy. The strategy is an overview of your framework. The framework is like, if I was to whiteboard this out for you, that's what it would look like. The strategy is the what you're gonna be doing. If I was a general, I would have a whole bunch of soldiers and they're like, okay, this is where you're gonna go. And they tell people where to go. They're like, wait, why am I going over here? Like, what's the point of this? Okay, the first step is not to give them the tactics. The first step is to step back and say, okay, here's the strategy. This is what we're doing and why we're doing it. I help understand that and they say, okay, and then they buy into the strategy. Okay, that makes sense. Then when I shift to the tactics, now they're willing to go do anything I tell them because they understand the strategy of where they're going. So step number three now, here's where you finally start teaching the tactics. Okay, and the tactics are, okay, let me show you what we're gonna do. Step number one, we're gonna do this. Step number two, step number three, step number four. Okay, if you've ever bought my course or Dean's course or Tony's course or anybody's course before, you've probably seen this, right? Most courses are teaching the tactics. Okay, the courses you remember, the courses that have transformed you, they start with the first two things we talked about. They don't just lead right here. Most people just lead with the tactics. This is where they're going directly. These are all important. If you don't set up each of these pieces and show them each individually, then you miss people all along. Does that make sense? Okay, now we move on to the fourth and last step here inside the framework is giving them social proof that's gonna work for them as well. There's this weird thing you're gonna find is a lot of times, as soon as you start publishing, you start putting products out there and courses out there, people are gonna look at you. Course Russell's gonna do, it looks like he's 11 years old for crying out loud. Of course he can do it, right? Like everyone's got a thing and they're gonna say the same thing about you. And you're gonna be like, wait, me? Like I'm just a normal person. But for every reason, because you're positioning yourself and you're showing them, like you're the one that is this guide, if you are taking this, they're always gonna be skeptical initially. So your job has come back and it's okay. Let me show you other people I've taken on this path. I took So-and-So on the path and So-and-So on the path and here's other people I've taken on this path before. And so this is an example right here. This is Stacy Martino, but she's created a whole bunch of frameworks that help people in their marriages. Her and her husband have created this company that's saved over 10,000 marriages. So they went initially themselves, they went on this thing and they got this result for themselves. Then they came back down and started helping other people and now they help 10,000 people get this result over and over and over and over again. And they have frameworks to take people through every single step. Inside their program, they have less than a 1% divorce rate, which is insane. Now it's important you have these case studies because without a case studies, they're not gonna actually believe your framework. So that's my framework on how to teach frameworks. And I wanna share with you guys because so many times people are like, they just teach to teach. I don't know about you, but I went to school, I went to college and there are some amazing teachers out there. Some teachers that changed my life. But so many teachers come up there, they open the textbook and they start reading. They're going through the tactics and half the kids are asleep, no one's really getting changed, no one's having the transformation they want. When you learn how to teach this way, where you go through a process, you tell them the story, how you learned, you earn it, you show them your strategy, you show them the tactics, you give them results, then you're not only gonna become a better teacher, you're gonna be able to give people what you really want, which is giving them a transformation. And that's the goal, that's the process. That's why we're doing all this stuff. We give them the transformation, that's when you get more customers, that's when you change life. Like it feels so good. As much fun as this is for you to, like whenever you did this, the very first time you did this, and you got the result for yourself, I promise you, this is amazing and you thought it was awesome, right? But I guarantee you, there's something even better than that. The first time you get somebody else to get that result and you give them that transformation, it always feels better. And that's the gift we wanna give you guys, okay? The money is awesome, the branding is awesome, all these things are cool, but the thing that, the reason why I do it, the reason I Dean does it, the reason I Tony does it, is because when you give someone else that transformation, there's nothing in this world that feels better than that.
