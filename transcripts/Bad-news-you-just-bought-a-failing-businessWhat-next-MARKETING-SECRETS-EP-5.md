## Transcript
We made a big mistake. We shouldn't have bought this. It's losing money every single day. We wired tens of millions of dollars for this company. It went from being really, really profitable to not profitable almost overnight where now we were like losing money where like every single day, losing tens of hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is not the highlight reel of like, we bought this company, it's super successful. This is like all of the rest of the stuff we learned along the way that I wish I would have known. It would have saved me so much time, energy and effort. It was, it was crazy. Hey, this is Russell Brunson and you are listening to the Marketing Seekers podcast. I'm so excited to have you here today. I could have paid cash by a private plane but instead I took that money and invested it in a hand doodle whiteboard software company that turned out to be one of the biggest mistakes in my life almost until we fixed it. There's some big ups, some downs, a whole bunch of stuff. I'm sure you guys behind this is what we did. I'm gonna talk about what the company was, what are the front-end offers, where why we were so excited by this specific company, what happened when we bought it and how everything crashed to the ground, the things we learned to get people to actually migrate from their platform, two click funnels, a bunch of things are doing in the future and a whole bunch more. I want to put this intention for you guys as you're listening to this episode today. As you're listening to it, I'm gonna, again, I'm walking you guys behind the scenes of this acquisition we did and you may or may not be looking to acquire a company. It doesn't matter. The lessons I learned along the way will be good for you no matter where you are. This episode is actually brought to you by a really cool software company called Doodly.com. If you go to Doodly, you'll find out a hand doodle software. We'll talk more about that but they are definitely sponsoring this episode. With that said you guys, let's jump in the podcast and have some fun. You're listening to Marketing Secrets with your host, Russell Brunson. Back story goes back to when I was in college and I was just first learning this whole internet marketing game and one of the guys I met also dabbling in internet marketing and his name was Brad Cowans. This had been like, man, early 2000s, 2001, 2002. He was a big SEO guy back in the day. Eventually he created a product called Fat Loss Factor which was a weight loss offer which literally was like my favorite funnel back in the day. He had hand doodles software that doodled out the sales video. Hey Brad Cowan here. I own an online video software development company and I've been selling products and services online since 2002. And it converted great. He made tons of money with it and then eventually he sold that business or that product and I remember the other time he actually joined me in a circle and he showed up and it's funny because in their circle everyone would get up and talk about their business and Brad got up and he's like, I don't have a business. I sold my business and we're like, oh, we don't talk about it. He's like, I don't know yet. We're trying to figure out what to do. Shortly after that I remember me and a message back and forth and he said he wanted to create doodle software. He's like, I had a ton of success with that. I want to create a doodle software. And I was like, there's a lot of people that have created doodle software. Like that doesn't seem to be that big of a market. Like why would you even do that? But he really wanted to and he created the product and he launched it and I didn't hear much about it. And again, I have two or three friends that actually sell hand doodle software. So I just like, oh yeah, it's hand doodle software. It's like a year or two later. I was messaging Brad just asking him how it was going. And he told me he said that we're selling like 500 copies of this doodle software a day. And I was like, wait a day? Like 500 new buyers a day? And he's like, yeah, this is amazing. And then he's like, I took the model we figured out and I created a new software called Toonly. So Doodly was like the hand doodle software. Toonly was like a cartoon version. We have cartoons and stuff. And he said, I have 500 buyers a day. He's like, we're making tons of money because like, but I don't have what you have with ClickFont. I was like, I don't have a back end. Like I wish I had a continuity program. I'm always 500 people a day. I could put him into where I was getting paid monthly, but I didn't have something like that. So the next two or three years I kept going back and forth with him. And I remember he showed me, he's like, I figured out this model. And it's the reason why I'm able to sell 500 copies a day. So what I did is like, I created the Doodly.com homepage. If you go to that homepage, you'll notice that there's the sales page for the sales letter software. And inside of it, it's like $67 a month for the software. And he's like, but I don't drive any traffic that page. He's like, I have a special page. It's like Doodly.com slash whatever, Facebook or YouTube or whatever, wherever you drive the traffic from. And he's like, you go to that page instead of selling it monthly, we have a one time fee where you pay $67 for lifetime access to the software. And the page, it literally says it's like special offer just for Facebook visitors, normally $67 a month if you go to the homepage, but because you're here it's $67 lifetime access right now. So that was the first thing, like this irresistible offer where you go from $67 a month to $67 lifetime. That was the offer that got 500 buyers a day to come in. So he was making $67 for everyone that came in, but then his first upsell was a whole bunch of templates for people who were using the software. And he sold that for $97 one time for like three or 4,000 templates. And his take rate on OT01, which was $97 offers like 60%, which is crazy in the upsell two and three. And like, but the funnel was just killing it, right? All these buyers are coming in. But the biggest thing he says is like, I don't have continuity, I'm a click funnel, so I need to build something. So he spent the next couple of years building out this video, like a video hosting platform called VOOM-LIDI, he was gonna let, he was gonna host all these videos on. Hi, I'm Brad Callan. And today I'm extremely excited to introduce you to VOOM-LIDI. The first and only all-in-one software that can instantly and automatically upload, sync, store, and then host your online videos. And after he created it, it was actually really, really good. And so what he was gonna do is make it where when someone creates a video, then they can host it on his video platform. That would be the continuity that he was gonna, he was gonna make from it. And then for some reason, he created the continuity, like the platform, and then it never really took off. I don't know exactly why, if I'm completely honest. I know he tried to launch it one way and then he tweaked it to be like this course creation platform, and then he just never really figured it out. And Brad decided he wanted to sell the company. And he actually reached out to me, because about the time is when we were looking, we were talking to people about potentially buying ClickFunnels, and said, hey, do you have somebody that you could introduce me to? So I was like, yeah, I have this really good business broker, so I introduced Brad to this business broker, and had him crossed our mind that we would potentially gonna buy it. And about the time we decided we weren't gonna sell ClickFunnels, and instead we're gonna build ClickFunnels 2.0, and then one of the big things that I kept thinking through was like, I wanna figure out ways to have more non-rustle-based front-ends, right? Like my face is on the front end of all of our front-end products and our courses and our things that bring people into ClickFunnels, which is cool, but if we ever wanna sell some there, go public, or whatever the next step would be, it's weird if I'm the only person. If I get hit by a bus, what happens to the company, right? So the question was like, how do we build more non-rustle-based front-ends? That was kind of the thought, and then all of a sudden, Brad messes me one day, he's like, hey, we got three or four people looking to buy the platform, and he's like, you're opinion on something we're talking. And I also had this idea that popped in my head, I was like, he's getting 500 buyers a day just on duly.com. It's like counting tunely.com and the other ones, like what if we bought that company and we put these 500 buyers a day, got them into ClickFunnels, like what would that look like? That would be the huge, like these are non-rustle-based front-ends, they're software front-ends, like there's this thing, he's figured out the model, he's figured out this thing, he's crushing it, like we should just, we should buy that, and also now we have all these different front-ends that aren't my face on them. The opportunities seem to be really, really good for us. We took all the customer lists from Brad's company and from ours, and just to see if they're the same customers, there's only like a 5% crossover, it's like 95% of the customers were not ClickFunnels members, which in our mind was like, this is this huge thing. And so we all decided, we decided to buy it, it was extremely expensive, as you can probably tell, his company was killing it. So it was our first big acquisition, we had to get a bank loan, and like it was stressful and all those kind of things. The first problem we ran into is, right when we were about to close this whole deal was the same time that Dave Woodward, who was our CEO at the time, was running the company, got his brain tumor. So that was the first thing of just like, we lost the person who was running the entire deal, which was, and you know, a year later, it's still like, just this been really, really hard thing. The second thing is we never bought a company before. So we didn't know how it works. So we're buying this company with Brad and all these products, and there's like 100 employees. And so we buy this company, and then the day, we close on the day we close, then Brad's like, okay, here's the company, like good luck you guys. And we, I never even thought through, like I think most companies that are buying companies have like a mergers and acquisitions department, they're like onboard people, and we didn't think through any of that stuff. So we bought the company, wired in the money, and like, oh, we have this company, that's all of a sudden like, we have to hire 100 people, we have to like figure out contracts, we have to figure out, and it was a nightmare, we didn't have any migration plan. And again, I lost Dave's, now it's like, Russell, like, what are you gonna do with these 100 new employees? And I was like, I have no idea. So that was really, really stressful and painful. We also found questions we should have asked. The company was basically Brad, and Brad's insanely talented. So there's Brad, and then there was like, 100 people that worked under Brad. There was no organization, there were no managers, there were no, like all that kind of stuff that you have in a typical company. Brad didn't have it. He's just super talented and managed all these people. So when Brad's company was gone, all of a sudden like, I had 100 direct reports reporting back up to me, and everyone asked me a thousand questions, and I was like, I don't even know what to do right now. Like it was kind of crazy. The operations was not in place for that company. Brad was running his own ads. He was, you know, he would be checking ads hour by hour, minute by minute, making tweaks and changes, and like, so when we had our ads to take it over, you know, they're not checking every single ad set multiple times an hour, like he was able to do. So he was optimizing constantly, tweaking the funnel, tweaking stuff, and like, it was his sole focus for four or five years he was building it up. And so when we took it over and we're plugging into like, a machine with media buyers and people and all that sort of stuff, and there's different divisions from funnel team and from ads team, and like, it went from being really, really profitable to not profitable almost overnight, where now we were like losing money, we're like every single day, losing tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. But Brad, it's okay because we have this huge customer list people are coming in, except for one, let's get all these people into click funnels, maybe we'll add 10 or 20,000 people in click funnels. We promote this big webinar to the dudely and the tunely and all the customer lists. We have three or 4,000 people registered and we're like, this is gonna be amazing. Hey, my name is Russell Brunson and first off, I wanna thank you so much for registering this special web class we're doing for dudely and tunely customers. In about halfway through the presentation, I look over to the comments, they were not, they were not going well. People were upset, they were complaining, this is sales pitch. What I quickly realized is that the customers who were buying dudely and tunely were not who I thought they were. I thought they were marketers using videos to market their business. When I found out really quickly, it's people who are buying and we're people who are course creators, not business owners and marketers. These people had never done a webinar, they never been sold to. It was bad. We sold a few on the webinar, but it was not slammed dunk by any stretch. Yeah, that night we were all like stressed out and we're like, we made a big mistake, we shouldn't have bought this. It's losing money every single day. The buyers are not buying click funnels and we got 100 people messaging us for support. We didn't know what to do. So I sat down and I wrote an entire script that we're gonna hand animate. We found one of the animators who did a lot of work with Brad to do dudely videos. He said, here's the script, dudele this video out. And then we found something to do, the tunely videos. And he said, here's the same script. I tweaked some things for tunely. I need you to make a tunely version of it. And so now someone went and they spent a month or two going to making a dudely hand doodle video and a cartoon video. The whole goal was to take people from who are buying dudely or buying tunely and bridge the gaps so they would want to become funnel builders. And so much of marketing is just bridging gaps. You guys understand that? If you think about it, whenever you're trying to sell whatever your product is, like you're selling a book, someone may not like, why do I need traffic seekers? It doesn't make no sense. Why I need to bridge the gap. Like would you have a business? Business needs customers, right? Customers are traffic, that's why. So I had to bridge this gap with like, oh, I actually need that thing. Right, so all of business is about that figure. Like what is the result that you offer people? What is the thing that people are looking for? Like how do you bridge the gap between those two things? And so dudelefunnels.com and tunelefunnels.com were a sales video to bridge the gap between where they were today and where I need them to go to actually buy ClickFunnels. And from that, it was cool because we started seeing people actually start signing up for ClickFunnels through these different funnels. Oh, I think Kevin's like, not all is lost. Like we can bridge the gap. We can convince these people why funnels is what they need to really get to the next level. So we made those bridges. By me just taking my existing webinar that had converted for internet marketers for the last 10 years and trying to put it on these course creators, it wasn't a bridge that they were able to follow, right? I had to create something very specific for them. And then after we had those things and they were working, then we went back and said, okay, let's go and let's actually add the dudelefunnels offer as upsell number three in the funnel. And so we went back through and added it as upsell number three. So now when you go, if you buy a dudele, you'll see, dudele for $67, then there's $97 lifetime pack and then there's another offer. And then it's ClickFunnels trial, which is basically the dudelefunnels video. And then we pushed people to trial with that on the dudelefunnel and the tunelefunnel built into the funnel now. dudele.com, like that funnel is one of the top 10 ClickFunnels affiliates. That's how much new trials they consistently bring in. It's one of the top 10 lead sources we have right now, which is amazing. So it's finally starting to work. I need to give credit where credit is due. When all this stuff was happening, Kevin Richards, who's been one of the man, one of the greatest gifts of my life over the last year. And he came in and has become like our CMO and COO of ClickFunnels. Kevin's the one who like took the dudelefunnels, tunelefunnels and after I built the sales video and the initial sales layers, we've them into the ClickFunnels funnels. And so like he's been just insanely good, helpful for us to get these things in place. And so like, how do you juggle all these things when you're struggling? Like it's finding more help. It's finding the right people. It's getting the right people who can, who skill-set is to do these things. And so I was lucky I was able to find someone to help with that. It took us a year to get the structure, the people, the offers, the bridge points, like all those things in place to where now this becomes a really good front end engine to bring people in the ClickFunnels and things like that. Where we're going so that you guys can watch over the next couple of weeks, months and years, I told you guys before that Brad had built a video hosting platform called VOOMLY. Video hosting is like the big thing, right? Like we can do video hosting with VOOMLY just as well, if not better than them. Plus Brad had built this really cool engine into it, like a video funnel engine where you can build super complex video funnels through the VOOMLY player, which is insanely cool. And so you'll see the new version. It hasn't launched yet, but basically by Doodly or Toonly, they're all kind of cross out inside of the software. On top of that, we're also gonna be taking these video, VOOMLY video funnels technology and plugging into ClickFunnels. So ClickFunnels members will hopefully stop using Vimeo and Wistia and YouTube to host their videos or start using VOOMLY instead, because first off, it's a better platform. Second off, you're able to do video funnels, things like that. And third off, it's just gonna be super easy integration. And so over time, I think VOOMLY, just the video hosting platform could be a 20, 30, $40 million a year business just by itself. There were a lot of things we learned on the way. We learned that you need to have somebody in place of migrating people over. We learned that you gotta make sure when you're buying a company, you're not just looking at like, ooh, the marketing. Like the ads are converting, the funnels are getting, da, da, da. It's like, who's looking at the operational side of things? Like who's gonna manage these people? Like what's it gonna look like? Like is there a process for running ads? There's one super genius who is doing all this stuff. And if he leaves and he is leaving, he sold the company, like what happens? Like do the ads just crash? Like we've known now to ask the right questions. So hopefully that helps some of you guys. If you haven't used Doodly or Tune the Ad, you should go check it out. But I would go to the homepage, you'll see it's $67 a month and then just wait and we'll retarget you and you'll get an ad somewhere that'll give you the lifetime deal. So there's your guys homework. Is go let us stock you with some ads and go find it out. But then look kinda at the scenes, like buy slowly, watch the funnel, look at the process. Like for you to go and funnel hack that and look at the process is worth at least the price of buying the software. So go buy the software, funnel hack it, watch it, and then figure out how could I reverse engineer a funnel like this for my specific business. Thank you so much for listening to this episode.
