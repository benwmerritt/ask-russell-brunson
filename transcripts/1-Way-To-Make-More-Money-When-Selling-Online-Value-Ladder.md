All right, welcome back. Now in the last video we talked about what is a funnel. And by the way, if you haven't had a chance to read the Dotcom Secrets book, I would recommend it because this is where we go deep into like what is a funnel. The whole concept of whoever spends the most money to acquire customer wins is all talked about in here. We talk about funnel structures and like it's a really good book to help you understand the strategy behind funnels if you don't have it yet. So click on the button down below. There'll be a page where you can go get a book. I think it's $7.95 shipping and handling, but that's what this is all about to help you understand funnel structure better. Now one of the core concepts inside of here that I want to share with you because it's such a key to understanding how funnels work is a concept called the value ladder. And so the way the value ladder works, if you look at this image right here, on the left hand axis you have value. This is how much value you're giving someone. As the arrow goes up, the higher the value is. On the bottom axis it has price and as you go to the right the price gets more and more expensive. Now most business owners, like the most ideal thing would be able to provide the most amount of value for somebody and get the most amount of money, right? For example, we have a coaching program. We charge a million dollars to create somebody's funnel for them. And that's amazing, right? Like in a perfect world I could go to every single person and be like, hey, it's a million dollars, I'll create a funnel for you and it's going to be awesome. The problem is like if I walked up to this and I saw you on the street for the first time and I'm like, hey, my name is Russell Brunson. I know I look like I'm 11 years old, but if you give me a million dollars I will build a funnel for you. You're going to think I'm insane, right? Because I provided zero value to this point. Yeah, that's what a lot of us as business owners are doing. We're coming and we're pitching our most expensive high thing and shooting for the fences. But people have not received value from us so they don't want that. So if you look at like how businesses work, it moved through this thing called a value ladder where initially when someone first comes into your world, they're kind of testing the water and they're filling things out. So what you want to do is try to provide value for them right there for free. And if they get value, they tip their toe in the water and they're like, wow, that was really, really cool. I had a good experience with so-and-so and they receive value. Us as humans, we naturally will want more and we'll start sending up saying, well, that was a really good experience. Like what else do you have? And we'll move up the value ladder. We have a chance to offer them more value, but they'll give you more money. And then if they receive value at that level, they'll naturally want more and they'll keep moving through this ascension until you either stop selling them something or tell you offend them. And that's how business works. And so for you is understanding this process of the value ladder. And you know this in the real world, right? Somebody came to you the first day and said, hey, what do you do for a living? You would tell them and you try to explain some stuff and try to give them something like, oh, cool, that's awesome. And you build some rapport and there'd be some value there. And then the next thing you do is you could offer them something else. Okay? It's the same thing like if and when you met your spouse, like the first time you met them, you know, the first thing you ask them on a date and then you provide value. If they have a good time on the date, then you go on a second date and it keeps going on until you get married, right? There's this logical progression. Yet for some reason online, we all forget that all these like common sense rules fall out of the world because they're like, oh, they're pixels and they're things and it's traffic. But no, it's people. You have to understand that. So what happens is every single funnel is a value ladder. Okay? When somebody comes to my very first page and I'm saying, hey, my name is Russell Brunson. I want you to give me your email address. If I stop there, you receive no value. Like why would I give you my email address? Okay? If you come to a page and I'm like, hey, my name is Russell and I wrote a really cool report called blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever it is and say, I'll give you this report for free. Just give me your email address and I'll send it to you. And you're like, huh, okay. You give me your email address. I send you this report. You get a report, you get some value. Like that was really, really good. Russell's a cool dude. And on the next page in the funnel, that's like, hey, I just sent you the report. Go check it out. I think you're going to love it. But while you're here, I want to make a really special offer to you and I try to provide value again. Like normally I sell this thing for blah, but I'm going to give you a special discount because you're here right now. Or you know, whatever that thing might be. Because you're a first time subscriber, normally, you know, the first thing I want to sell you is this thing. So like a lot of times in my business, I sell books for really, really cheap. Or we do, you know, if you're an offline business, maybe it's a free exam or whatever it is, but it's something you're providing value. Okay. And if someone gets that, they buy the next thing, then the next page is like, hey, you just bought my book for $7.95. On the next page, it's like, hey, your book's coming. You're going to love it. But you know, some people like to learn in a classroom situation, I have a home study course. It's this or whatever that thing might be. Same thing works in e-commerce. Okay. People always tell me, well, that works in information, but not in e-commerce. But the same thing works in e-commerce. One of our number one click funnel sellers right now. He built a huge funnel. It was the most successful funnels I've ever seen. And it started with a flashlight. Hey, this is a tactical flashlight. Would you like to buy it? And people bought the flashlight and they started thinking, how else can I provide value to this person and start bringing them through a value ladder? He said, look, you bought a flashlight for this price. How would you like a second? I want to 50% off. And boom, like half people said yes. It's like, hey, now you got this flashlight. We want to kit like a carrying case. We can put it in. And people are like, oh yeah, sure. Yes. Boom. And then took the next thing. And he kept thinking, how else do I provide value? Hey, do you want rush shipping? Yes. Hey, do you want this? Yes. And so the value ladder is always thinking about that. So every time I'm working on a funnel, I'm thinking about this as like somebody they see an ad, they see something, they click on something, they come to my page, the first page of my funnel. And I'm thinking, how do I provide this person value? What do I want in return? I want their email address or maybe I want their credit card or maybe I want them to register for a webinar or maybe I want them whatever the action is on that page. I'm thinking, how do I provide value to this person? And if I do it in a cool way and they connect and have a good experience, guess what? They're going to want to buy again and again. And that's how you build a business the right way. OK. And so as we do more and more of these trainings, we'll go more into value ladder because value ladder is happening in a bunch of places. Happens inside of your funnel. Every page in your funnel is the next step of a mini value ladder. OK. Also, and we'll talk about this in the next major training, after some goes to your first funnel, then usually we have a second funnel and that's a bigger piece of the value. So kind of like the micro and the macro. But right now, I just want you thinking about that. It's like every single interaction I have with somebody, I need to provide them value. And then if they like that, they will naturally ascend up and they want more value. And I can charge them more. And if they like that, I can provide them more. And we take them through this process. OK. That's how I can go right now and get people to pay me a million dollars to build a funnel for them because I provided value to all these levels. I provide value to my books, to my software, to my training, to my events. Now when it comes to there, it's like, yes, I trust Russell. I have rapport with him. He's awesome. I believe that he will do what he's going to do. And now they're willing to invest the big money. OK. And so if your business is the same thing, and so you have to start thinking through that. And so I want you guys to understand that concept of the value ladder. Other thing is if you don't have a copy of this book yet, I highly recommend. We'll have a link down below to go get it. And again, this will teach you all about funnel structures and teach you about value ladders and a whole bunch of other things. This will help you understand the strategy of funnels in a much deeper way. So get the book if you don't have it yet as well. Thanks so much and we'll see you on the next training.
