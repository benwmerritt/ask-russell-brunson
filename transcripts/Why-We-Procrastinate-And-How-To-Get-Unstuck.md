My name is Russell Brunson and the second question today to go over is procrastination. How many of you guys are procrastinating too long and you know that? So if you have a problem and you're busy watching YouTube videos, how do you beat procrastination? So I'm actually going to do this one out. So this right here, this is your computer. And on your computer there's tons of stuff happening. You've got your, in fact I'm going to make a little laptop. You see my mad drawing skills. I'm actually really bad at doodling. There you go. There's your laptop. And there's all these things happening. There's YouTube and there's Instagram and there's Facebook. In fact, most of you guys are watching this on one of these platforms. Right now I guarantee. And so you're probably in this procrastination mode where you're not focusing on just getting stuff done. And so for me what I have to do is a lot of it comes back to like how you structure day and how you figure some of these things out. But if you want to stop procrastinating, there's a couple of things. One of the reasons why entrepreneurs procrastinate. I learned this from Dan Sullivan. He talked about, I'm going to move my books over here. So he talked about most of his entrepreneurs, right? We have this vision of this thing we want to accomplish, right? So here's your vision and you're like, I want to do that. I want to serve these people. I want to create this product. I want to make money doing what you have this vision where you're trying to go, right? And here is you over here and you see this vision and you're like, this is how, what I have to go. And so you start on this path and you start walking towards your vision and then something happens where you get stuck, right? Where you're trying to learn something new that you don't understand and you're like, and you get stuck and then what happens? I don't know about you, but I've written now a couple books and I get this all the time to write my books where I'm writing and there's like pain associated and my brain's like, I need to do anything except for the painful thing that's over here. So you start trying to figure out other things to do and what happens is then you start shifting to this mode of procrastination. And usually this detour happens when you're trying to figure out how do I do something, right? You're like, how do I do this thing? You start researching and you're listening to podcasts and you're reading a book and another thing, another thing, another thing and you're going to search on YouTube and then you listen to the video that shows you how to, but then you see all the cute girls in the video there, so you watch those and you're off on this tangent and then you're and next thing you know, it's like three days later, right? How many guys has that happened for more than once? And so what Dan Souleman talked about is, so look, if you want to get to your vision, you can't keep procrastinating. That's what this says right here, procrastinating. Because the reason, the thing that causes procrastination is this, how do I do this thing? You say, well, you have to start shifting your focus to, instead of like, how do I do it, is this question of who? Who already knows how to do the thing I'm trying to get done, right? So for me, when I was building ClickFunnels, I could have been like, all right, first step, I need a code software called ClickFunnels, right? And I would have sat down and I would have like, okay, I got a programming book and I'm going to read programming, I'm going to learn Ruby on Rails, I can learn JavaScript, I can learn all these things. And I would have been procrastinating forever because I'm not smart enough to be a programmer, right? Or I said, like I said, who do I know who actually knows how to execute on this already? And I met my partner, Todd Dickerson, who's the dude who built ClickFunnels initially and Todd was the who who already knew how to do it. So I had to learn how to do programming, I just found Todd, who's the who, and he went into our programming and got us closer to the vision, right? And that's like, okay, I need to design a sales letter. Now I'm not a designer, so I needed somebody to help with that and then I needed, and instead of me trying to figure out how to do, like how to use Photoshop, how to use Facebook ads, how, how, how all these things, each of those hows puts you into this like mode of procrastination where you're stuck forever, right? And so instead of doing, figuring out the hows, I figured out who are the people I need, okay? If you look at any good superhero movie, what always happens, right? Usually there's like this person, there's you, and they say it'll put a little capo on you, so you're a superhero, right? But most superheroes can't say the day, maybe it's just because I watched Justice League and Avengers and everyone recently, but if you look at all the superhero movies, when they got a big vision, what do they do? The Justice League calls their people in, the Avenger Group gets, they get the Hulk and they get Thor and they get all the people and they get all the who's around to help them to dominate this vision, okay? So for you as the entrepreneur, if you're not careful, you can get in this procrastination mode where instead of saying who are the people I need to build this vision, then it gets you off this procrastination or it gets you moving towards your vision. And some of you guys just sit back and say, well Russell, I don't have any money to hire a Todd or hire the people I need to get my vision, so I have to learn it because I don't have any money, I'm broke, right? Well, I got good news for you. Guess how much money I pay Todd to build ClickFunnels? At first zero, now he gets paid a lot of money, right? But what happened? We partnered on it, he saw the vision, he's like, oh, that vision's awesome, I want in. I said, cool, let's get together and let's do this thing. And we both got together, we both put our skin, our time, our effort into it and then we build the thing, right? And then I don't know how to buy ads, so then John on my team, I'm like, John, here's the vision, John's like, I'm in, boom, he started buying ads and then we started bringing all our Avenger team together to go and conquer this vision. So for you, you just got to figure out what's your vision, who are the who's you need to execute on that vision and then bring them together and all the users, superpowers, partner together and then go and create the vision. That way you won't get stuck in procrastinating, which is where most people get stuck. And I always tell people, entrepreneurs usually don't, it's not that they don't have the vision, the problem is they either run out of time or money before they ever get to the vision. It's because of this, they're trying to figure out the how, the how is on every single step of the path. And when you do that, you never actually get to the end goal. So take your computer, turn off YouTube, turn off all these things that aren't helping you and start focusing on who, who are the who's I need to dominate this. Now, depending on when you're watching this video, I have a really cool service coming out called FunnelRolladex that's full of a whole bunch of who's to help you get to your vision. And so it's either there or it's going to be there very, very soon, but FunnelRolladex is a tool for you guys to help get your visions created as an entrepreneur, to launch your business so you can make money and change the world. So that's the second question about procrastination and hope that helps you guys. Thank you so much for watching.
