Today we are diving into a topic that is near and dear to me, which is entrepreneurial ADD. So you know what that feels like, right? Well, you're trying to focus on something. I need to get this project done. And all of a sudden you're checking social media and then Twitter and then text and then phone call and then this and that and then lunch and then someone's coming by and there's a squirrel outside like all the things, right? It's hard to focus sometimes. And so this video is going to be about all the things that I do personally to help me be able to get focused so I can get projects done. If you don't understand how to function, how to work with ADD, it can be really hard. But if you understand it, ADD is actually a superpower. It reminds me of the X-Men, right? The X-Men are these amazing people. Like, someone can fly, someone can walk through walls. It's like the greatest superpower of all time. But then in the movie, they're always trying to like get rid of their superpowers and making them like everybody else. What you don't understand is that entrepreneurial ADD is a superpower. It's what makes you great. And if you understand how hard it is, you can literally use that as a superpower to change your life and the life of the people you can call the serve. So let's jump right into exactly the five things I do to help me with my entrepreneurial ADD. The first focus hack that I use is very simple one. It's setting a deadline. Okay, this is important because for those of us with entrepreneurial ADD, like we're not careful we get in this motion where we're just spinning around in circles, right? To be successful as an entrepreneur with ADD, you have to have something you're moving towards. Okay? It's all about momentum. Okay? We're in a weird spot where we don't normally feel like happy instead of like most people, we either feel like we're in momentum or out of momentum. And you can't have momentum unless you have a deadline, something you're working towards. Okay? So first thing to do is we set a deadline. And this is important because if you don't have that deadline, we have this thing in our brain where like, oh, we'll do it tomorrow. I call this the maniana principle, like, oh, maniana, we'll do it, maniana. Right? But the problem with maniana is when you get to tomorrow, tomorrow never comes because now it's tomorrow again, and we keep pushing this thing. Yesterday, you said tomorrow, so just do it. That's a very firm deadline and then not let it shift. I usually put it on a calendar. I let my staff, my teammates know like, this is when this is going live. That forces me to say, I have to get this done because otherwise I'm going to be on stage or doing a webinar or going on Facebook live or something without something to show for, right? So by creating that deadline and calling my shot, it forces me to actually get things done. Now, focus hack number two is after you've set your deadline, now we have to reverse engineer all the things you need to do to actually hit that deadline. Now, if we don't do this, the problem with our brains will say, okay, this is the deadline and we'll wait till like literally like the last possible hour and also like, oh, we're stressed out trying to get things done. So what I do is I start reverse engineering all of the milestones I got to hit to be successful and each of those milestones I attach a deadline to. That means in three days now, this has to be done in five days after that, this is the idea. I set what I call a plateau or plomo deadline. Now, I first heard this concept from the greatest copyrighters who's ever lived on this planet. His name is Gary Halbert. He said, what I do is I set plateau or plomo deadlines on every single thing I'm doing and explain this principle and I'm sure it's not politically correct, but it's his explanation, not mine. Plot to plomo stands for lead or gold, right? The bullet or the bribe. So what he explained is that in some countries, when there's somebody that wants to get a law passed, right, let's say someone from a drug cartel or something, they want to get something done, they break into the politician's house and they come up to him and say, okay, you got two options and you can change this law and you get gold, the bribe or you don't and you get lead. So when those are your options, plot to plomo, somehow you figure out how to get the thing done, right? You said you have to trick your mind to be the same things. You set this deadline that in your mind, like, if I get this, I'm going to take this bribe and it's going to be this thing I can celebrate. If not, like, I'm going to die and I know that's kind of morbid, but I literally trick my mind to believe that. If I know this is due in three days now, I'm going to be until midnight that night getting it done because I do not want to miss it because in my mind, I'm like, this is let her go. Like, I have to get this done or else nothing else matters. All right, focus act number three and this one's going to be probably opposite of what most people will think and what most people have ever told you, okay? Number three is I'm going to block out focus time, but I'm not going to try to create a distraction-free zone. A couple of years ago, I had a chance to sit down and have lunch with one of the top ADD doctors on the planet and he told me something really fascinating. So that if you are a student or you have a son or a daughter who's struggling with ADD and they're at school trying to pay attention to the teachers, if you give them like a pencil or a fidget spinner, something to do and they're distracted by doing that, it's easier for them to pay attention to the teacher versus no distractions trying to sit there and listen. It's the reason why all of us struggle in school because of no distractions. When you have ADD, you actually need multiple distractions to be focused. So what I do personally, if I'm going to be writing, I need to get something done. What I do is I go in my office and I have a standing desk. I raise my standing desk and then I have a walking treadmill. So I put the treadmill desk on and I start walking. Okay? So now I'm walking and I'm writing. Next thing is I put something on my headphones. So I put headphones on and I listen to brain.fm. This gives me these binaural beats to help my mind to focus. But now I'm doing like three or four things. I'm walking, I'm listening, I'm typing and because I'm doing three or four things, it distracts me the point where I can actually be focused. This is what most people with ADD don't understand. I'm going to give a bunch of distractions to try to short-circuit everything else so I can focus on the one thing I actually have to do to get done. Focus hack number four is after you have got the deadline, reverse engineer, you're doing cool stuff to make sure you get the project done. Now what I recommend doing is actually documenting the journey publicly. This lets other people see that you're being accountable to what you're doing and you're more likely to do it knowing that you're going to disappoint other people if you're not doing it. Okay? So for example, about two years ago, I signed a contract with Hay House to do my next book and I spent two years not talking about it. Just trying to write it. I'm trying to write it. I'm trying to write it. Two and a half years later, the book still wasn't done. I decided I wasn't happy with it. So I literally deleted the entire book and I said, look, if I'm going to do this, I need to publicly show people what I'm doing, take them on the journey with me. And so on Instagram, we started documenting every single day, day by day, what I'm doing to write the book. What this did is first off, it gave me something fun to look forward to every single day, right? Number two, it gave me something like our sharing the journey with other people, which gave me energy and excitement to it. And then it also held me accountable to actually getting the things done. Now, the progress on this book is going so much faster in just like literally the last two weeks than the last two and a half years prior. So focus hack number four is to document the journey publicly to hold yourself accountable. All right. And our last focus hack is that every single milestone along the way, you need to celebrate the journey, right? Talked about how we have let her go the bribe or the bull, right? This is the bribe. This is the goal. Every single time along the journey that something happens, do you succeed, do you get done? You can't expect, oh, I got it done. Because if you do that, your brain's gonna be like, man, I keep hitting these milestones and nothing cool is happening. All that work and what did it give me? Why did I do it? Right? I told you earlier that people with ADD that we don't feel happy or feel sad. We feel like we're in momentum or not in momentum. So if we're not celebrating these things, we're not giving ourselves the gold or the bribe along the way, then our brain's not going to recognize momentum. It's gonna be easy first to get distracted to fill out a momentum, which makes us feel unhappy, depression, all those kind of things from not having rewards along the way. A lot of times for me, I'll celebrate something by coming home and we have ice cream that night or maybe I'm gonna go on and take a day off or I'm gonna do something crazy, but it's picking something little along the way every time you hit a milestone to celebrate and by doing that, it gives you moving towards the next milestone. Massages, treat yourself, mimosas, treat yourself, fine leather goods, treat yourself. All right. So those are my hacks. That's how I get so much stuff done. I'm curious for you, what are the hacks and things you kind of learn along the way? I would love any new ideas, any new updates, anything you guys have that I can use and apply to my process as well. Please let me know in comments down below. If you don't have one yet, which one are you most excited to try? I bet most of you guys is number three. I want to see you all listening and drooling treadmill when you're writing your next project. And if you enjoyed this video, I got another really cool video on the channel called How to Get Anything You Want. I think if you like this one, you are gonna love that one.
