I have two kids and after I had my first son I gained 70 pounds when I was pregnant with him. I stoned, he was a 10 pound baby and my stomach was like way out here. And I had him and I still had 50 extra pounds on me but it was hard. I started trying to learn more about eating right and exercising properly and I created a little website and I started getting some traffic from Pinterest, quite a bit of traffic, like 30,000 people a month. If I'm getting this much traffic I might as well monetize it. I got certified as a personal trainer and I decided to start writing some ebooks. So I wrote just a 10 day at home training program. I wrote a 12 week gym training program. What was really cool is they put out that first ebook and people bought it. Like people wanted something that they could purchase from me. I just kept writing different ebooks on things that I had interest in. During this time I also had my daughter so I had my second baby again gained 70 pounds. Again another 10 pound baby and after I had her I started getting frustrated because I felt like man nobody talks about like the real changes that happen after pregnancy. I made a video where I stood up and I said look standing up I have six pack but when I bend over like and I just showed my skin and that video weren't really viral. It got like 10 million views and I built this Facebook audience of about 400,000 people without spending any money on Facebook ads. Like in one week seven different people emailed me and said hey I want to build a funnel for you. What are funnels? I started googling and I kept seeing Russell Branson's name. I reached out to him and I was like hey your company is it like is this legit? And I'm like now and I said I'm like oh I can't believe I said that to Russell Branson but he ended up responding and he encouraged me just open a ClickFunnels account. What's cool about ClickFunnels is one it has helped me monetize you know audience my blog audience that I really enjoy writing and providing free content for. About 80% of my content is free. I just like helping people and putting that content out there. But two you know I now have all these different kinds of ebooks so I have an at-home training program. I have Cookbook. I have this program that helps women stop accidentally peeing their pants after they have babies. I'm coming out with a pregnancy trainer right now because we were able to utilize the marketing advice that Russell teaches and I had my audience and I was willing to be vulnerable and create that deep connection with women. The program just exploded. In the first week we sold $20,000 worth of copies of this ebook and I'd log in and I'd be like what we sold $5,000 today like in one day and then get super excited and I'd like text the team can you believe this you know and then I remember like I vividly remember where I was sitting when we had our first $20,000 day in one day we sold $20,000 and I was just like I remember being like this can't be real life like how is this even happening like I'm making more money in one day than before maybe I had made in six months you know and last year we helped over 50,000 women go through my programs using ClickFunnels like me as a single mom who just had a blog years ago sold over a million dollars of ebooks in four months as soon as I found out about ClickFunnels and I started leveraging the power of Facebook and learning how to drive traffic and like to be able to provide for my kids that way something I'm really really proud of.
