Really quick, in this video, I have my brand new book called Traffic Secrets and the last section I talk about growth hacking. What are all the ways you can use growth hacking to grow your companies? I'm going to show you guys in this video how Dropbox uses growth hacking, how Facebook uses growth hacking, how Hotmail uses growth hacking and then how we took those ideas and we used them to grow click funnels into the companies today. That's what's happening in this video. It's going to be a ton of fun. We watch that video when you come back. I'm going to share with you something really cool at the end. Make sure you watch this video and if you like it, please let me know down below. I'll see you guys when it's over. This is the title of this next segment. How hacking Facebook, Dropbox and Hotmail have earned us millions in free traffic secrets. As you guys know, there's this whole Funnel Hacker community. I am the original, the OG Funnel Hacker. What does Funnel Hacking mean? Some people would think it means going and stealing stuff. The answer is not that. Funnel hacking is all about looking at what people are doing and modeling it. As we're doing click funnels, I'm looking at how ... because I'm not a coder, I'm not a programmer. I have no ability to actually code and make click funnels. People always tell me, Russell, thank you so much for building click funnels. I don't know how to build click funnels. I have a genius named Todd Dickerson and a whole development team who built click funnels. I'm the dancing monkey on stage who gets to talk about it. My job was like, I got to figure out how to sell this thing. I'm looking at how do people sell software? I've never sold software before. I'm looking at it. I looked at what does Facebook do? How does Dropbox? How do they do ... to start looking at those things and Funnel Hacking the ideas? I'm going to share with you some of their ideas and then show you how we actually Funnel Hacked them to grow click funnels. You guys want to see that? All right, cool. To lead off this session, I want to talk about one of my first early friends and mentors in this whole business. I got a name, Mike Thillsame. This is Mike right here. Back in the day, he had a course called Butterfly Marketing, which is right here. It was still one of my favorite courses of this day. I keep telling Mike, you should write a book called Butterfly Marketing and bring these principles back. It's been almost a decade since they've been out there. Butterfly Marketing was a great product. Some of the basic gist of it was he, in Butterfly Marketing, talked about the Butterfly Effect. Some of you guys have heard this concept before where a butterfly flaps its wings in San Francisco, which causes a chain reaction events that turns into a tsunami on the other side of the world. Something like that. That's the concept of Butterfly Effect. He took that to marketing. He said, well, maybe this is true marketing. What are the little tweaks we can make on our pages or our funnels or our upsells that cause huge increase in profits in our business? In fact, Mike was one of the original originators of the OTO, the one-time offer. He was the first person that showed it to me. Here's how you do an upsell. I was like, oh my gosh. Adding that little thing in there, it changed everything for me. It's these little tiny Butterfly Marketing techniques. In fact, all you guys should tag Mike down below at Mike Thillsame or whatever and beg, Mike, write a book called Butterfly Marketing. We all want to buy it. That was the concept. All these little things you can do that have huge dramatic impact in your business over time. A lot of these things that I saw Facebook and Dropbox and all these companies do were like these little Butterfly effects. To make something truly viral, you have to get past your referral point. The market joiner calls the copulation rate, where the rate that your viral marketing grows. This is not planned, but I'm going to explain how viruses work according to my expertise. Since we're in the middle of the coronavirus, we might as well talk about this. Just kidding. What happens with the virus? Let's say you have a thing. You have one person that goes into the sink. For our intents and purposes, it's the landing page. Here's the landing page, there's your headline, and somebody opts in. If every one person that comes in here, on the backside, zero people pop out. I guess you have how to explain this the best way. The copulation is how many people come back through. If you have one person come in here and from there, maybe the word of mouth is like, well, that person, one out of 10 people tell someone else. You have a 0.1% copulation rate. Every person that comes through, every 10 people come through, one person will come back through and refer a friend and they come back in. That's not viral growth. If I said 100 people, it means I'll get 10. Most 10, I'll get one and eventually just stagnates and dies. The copulation rate is really low. If I create something where one person comes in here and they refer one person, then you have something that's not viral growth, but it's growth. If every one person joins, one person will come out and you have this thing just flat lines, which is cool. But viral growth happens when you get one person come in and you get more than one person come back. So 1.1 or 1.2 or whatever that might be is copulation rate. Now you send 100 people into here and you get 101 people that come back through viral growth and then 200 and 300, that's the whole mechanism. That's how a virus grows. In marketing, the butterfly marketing effect and things like that, how do you create things that make it so that for everyone who joins your landing page, how do you get more people to come in? Everyone who joins, click phones. To get true copulation rate, to get more than 100% referral is really, really difficult and doesn't happen very often. But even with that said, what can we do to get this number from 0.1 to 0.5 to 0.7 to 0.8? Because anything that happens there, other than that viral growth is just free traffic. So that's kind of the premise of what we're going to be talking about during this session here. Okay. So to have something go truly viral, each person who comes into your funnel, into your world, into your product to refer more than one person. That's how you start growing virally. All right. So here's how Dropbox did initially. And you guys probably heard if you follow the growth hacking strategy, that's how Dropbox did. So Dropbox came in, when a new user would sign up, they'd say, hey, if you tell your friends and your family by postings on Twitter and Facebook, we're going to give you more storage for free. And then people did that and Dropbox grew. Because everyone's like, oh cool, I got 10 megs of free storage. If I post this on Twitter and Facebook, I get an extra 30 megs or gigs, whatever it was. And Dropbox did that. And that's how they went crazy. For a while, they had true viral growth. For every single person who got sent for Dropbox, they had to bring in three or four more people. And then boom, it became Dropbox, viral growth. So that was the Dropbox hack that we learned. I was like, how can I apply that to click funnels? I'll show you how we did here in a second. I was like, that's so cool. Again, it helped Dropbox to go to over 500 million members worldwide, which is a lot of people. All right. Someone would join Facebook back in the early days. And I don't know if it still does this, but I haven't joined Facebook in 12 years. But back in the day, when you joined Facebook and you became a new user, it's like, hey, do you want to see if your friends are on here? Click this button. We're going to scrape your address book and see if your friends are on here. So scrape your address book, found all the people and say, cool, here's a lot of people on your address book who are already part of Facebook. Do you want us to contact all the people who aren't and invite them as well? Like, sure, you click a button, boom, and they would go and invite all the non-Facebook users to come to Facebook and really quickly Facebook exploded because of using a viral growth hack like this. Okay. Hotmail had a really cool growth hack as well. You probably heard this one as well. Hotmail came out and in every single email they sent out, they added a PS line, said, PS, I love you, get your free email at hotmail.com. And so what happens is that a group of people start using Hotmail and they ever start seeing like get your free email. Back in the day, email wasn't free and then people are like, oh, that's cool. So they signed up and they signed up and soon millions and millions and millions of people are all sending out emails to their friends, their family members, everyone they love, all driving people back into Hotmail. And that little butterfly thing, that little hack, that little growth hack where everyone called it, dramatically increased how many people came into Hotmail. Okay. All right. So again, I'm looking at that as the original funnel hacker. Like, how do I use these ideas? How can I use that to grow click funnels? And obviously I can't do the exact same thing, but like, how can I make something similar? So the first one, when we looked at Dropbox, we modeled Dropbox hack, right? So Dropbox, when someone came in and they sent it for Dropbox, they said, we'll give you more storage if you refer your friends. So initially, we launched ClickFunnels, but the same thing. The user would come to ClickFunnels, we'd give them 20 funnels in their account. And then the first page said, hey, if you refer your friends through Facebook or Twitter or whatever, we're going to give you more funnels. So when they refer at least one friend, they double, we doubled how many funnels they got. And then they had 40 funnels just by doing that. So when we first launched ClickFunnels, that's when we got tons of our initial viral growths by modeling Dropbox's growth hack, by doubling their funnels when they referred more people into the site, which is how we got a lot of initial growth initially. Okay. Next one is ClickFunnels plus Facebook's growth hack. The next thing we did is I didn't have the technology like Facebook did to go and grab your address book and spam all your friends. I wish I did because that'd be amazing, but we had to figure out how it's going to do something similar. So when we had our first webinar, people would sign up for the free webinar and then we'd give people a free 14-day trial of the ClickFunnels. And after they joined the webinar, we would say, hey, if you refer five friends, we're going to give you one of our products for free. And what happens when we register for the webinar, they refer five friends and then you get their free 14-day trial. Those five friends would come back and they would join, they refer friends. What happens, we were looking at the time, I think about 20% of the traffic that were coming in to register for every webinar were not from our ads that were spending there from the people who signed up for the webinar referring their friends back into it. So 20% of them lived in free traffic just by adding in a tele-friend script on the thank you page of our webinar. Okay. So again, we've used Facebook's growth hack. We modeled it. We tweaked it a little bit, put it on our page and got 20% more visitors for free to every one of our funnels that we were driving, people in the ClickFunnels at the time. All right. And then number, oh yeah, there you go, 20% in free signups. All right. And then this is the third last, this is my favorite one. You've probably seen this. We were looking at Hotmail. Hotmail had the PS, I love you, get your free Hotmail account here on every email. We said, what if we did it on ClickFunnels? So we create this little badge that's on every single page that says, built with ClickFunnels. And when you build a page by default on ClickFunnels, that badge is on there. And if you're building it, we plug your affiliate ID in there so you get paid commissions when they, and times someone clicks on that and signs it for ClickFunnels. But we built that in day number one into ClickFunnels. So every page by default had it and you can turn it off if you want, but it's there. And the results have been amazing. Over the past five years, the badge had generated over 10,000 people who have joined ClickFunnels. That's a million dollars per month in revenue because of that little badge we put on there, almost as an afterthought. Okay, that's $12 million per year right now in revenue we get because we put that badge on there. Okay, these little butterfly effects, these little things that cause huge, huge changes in your business. And so for you, I want you to start thinking about that. In your businesses, in your funnels, in everything you're doing, what are little hacks, little butterfly effect things, little viral things you can add in there that will increase how much traffic you're getting. And as you're going through other people sign up for like, watch what they're doing, be a funnel hacker, watch like, oh, that's how Dropbox did it. How can I apply that to what I'm doing? Oh, that's what Facebook did. How can I apply that to what I'm doing? Because little hacks had a dramatic increase on our company as a whole. It's fun because as you start looking at it that way, literally marketing is like hunting for buried treasure as you're going through years. Like you're looking for this thing like, where's the pot of gold? Oh, that I did. That's some gold. That's some gold. You're finding all these things and it's really, really fun. All right.
