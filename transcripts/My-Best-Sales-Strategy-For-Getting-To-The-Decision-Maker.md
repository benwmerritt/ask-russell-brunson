Okay, so Jack just asked a question. How do you get past the gatekeepers to the decision makers? All right, so this is something to understand. So here is any office on planet Earth, right? Here's the front door of that office. And somehow, and then out front there's like, usually there's, this is like chess, like me about playing chess, right? Outside there's like the first guard and there's usually like a table or something that like, hello, how can I help you, right? And then somebody get past that guard, then there's like all the other people here, right? You have to get through. And then back here is like the person you're trying to get to. Here's the decision maker. Like I must get to this person. If I get to them, all my wildest dreams come true, right? And usually next to the decision person, there's another guard that's blocking him, right? Okay, so this is like how it all works. So if you try to come in the front door, you're gonna get stopped right here the first person and they're gonna come back and be like, there's some crazy person in the front door. I'm only saying that because this happens all the time in front of my office here, just so you guys are fully aware, okay? And I'm like, and they come back, there's some crazy person. I'm like, oh, get away, because I don't know who they are. And they show up with a gun, who knows? You never know, right? And so you don't want to be that crazy person. So this is the strategy I think through, okay? This person's decision maker that you're trying to get to, the problem is that they're making so many decisions. They don't make the initial set of decisions. This person next to him, this is the gatekeeper. This is the person you care about, okay? Now this person could be an assistant, it could be a spouse, it could be a lot of things. One of the number one mistakes I see people happen all the time when my wife and I are flying. Almost every time we fly now, we get approached by somebody and they'll come up and they're like, oh, Russell, I'm so excited to meet you. You're like, oh, Russell, and my wife's sitting there. And I'm like, hey, it's my wife, Collette. And they're like, oh, hi. And they look back at me and they totally blow my wife off. Guess what happens? Instead of my wife's like, I don't like that person. And then I see my wife, I'll even see her all the time. She'll be like, she'll ask a specific question. Like, someone will say something, and she'll like, oh, and she'll say something to that person. And then that person will blow her off or ignore her or whatever. And then I'm very aware of it, she's very aware of it. The person's really so excited, I don't even notice it. But they offended the decision maker. Now I don't care how cool you are in the future, you're never gonna get past all the gatekeepers because my wife, oh, that's the person that blew me off in the airport. That's the person who didn't give me the time of day. That's the, you know what I mean? Same thing with my assistant, Melanie, some of you guys are my assistant, Melanie. All my decisions will go through her initially, right? And if she's been treated good, there's people that treat her really good, that know her and then they get through the gatekeeper. So I'd be looking at like, how do I do Dream 100 to the decision maker? How do I appeal to this person? Because this is the person that actually matters. Because if it doesn't get past that person, I'll never get to you as a whole. And so for me, it's all about figuring that out. Like who are the people? Like there was a big person I was trying to get hold of and I actually got some of that person's time. And so I just, I sent the spouse of that person a gift. And the person called me the next day, like in tears, was like, no one in my 20 years in business has ever thanked my wife for my time. And the fact that you did that now will be friends and partners for life. And we've done tons of deals together because of that, right? Cause I was very aware of like the person supporting the decision maker. Other times I'm like, I need to get the decision maker. I'm like, okay, who's the person supporting the decision maker? How can I make their life better? What can I send them? Can I send them gifts? Can I contact them? How do I build a relationship with them when I'm in an event? And don't try to bombard this person. You've already got a million people talking to him and like going crazy. And like, and I just know from my personal standpoint, and then I go to an event, I get 50,000 people asking me questions. I'm so like, over the line, I don't know what's even happening. The smart ones walk over to my assistant or walk to one of my partners and they talk to them. And that person then comes back to me later. Like, oh, did you meet so-and-so? This person's awesome. And that's like how you get around is by befriending the gatekeeper. So it's not how do I get past the gatekeeper? How do you build a relationship with the gatekeeper? Cause they are the gatekeeper. So there's the big secret for those who are wondering.
