## Transcript
All the most successful groups of people throughout time have had a mastermind group. Think about King Arthur in the Knights of the Round Table. You think about my group people, the funnel hackers, like the Illuminati. That's actually probably a bad example. But, all of us have a mastermind group of people where we get together and we share ideas, thoughts, passions to be able to get something even more successful than where we are today. If you think about it, they always say that you are the average of your five closest friends in terms of how much money you make, how successful you are, the things, the vision, everything you are doing is all based on the people you are surrounding yourself with. And the right mastermind group can elevate you to the next level. So, why should you have a mastermind group? And if you do have one, how do you actually run it? Well, if my mastermind group, the way it works is we get together twice a year and it gives us a chance to hold each other accountable. Every time before the next meeting happens, everybody is so excited to get stuff done that they promised they'd do last time because they don't want to disappoint the rest of the group. It gives you foresight and vision of what to do next. It's kind of like Wayne Gretzky. He said that the reason why he was so good is not because he knew how to find the goal, it's because he knew where the puck was going. Because he knew where it was going, he's able to get there before everybody else. And the same thing should be with the mastermind group. You figure out the vision of where you're all going collectively and you get there before everybody else. Other amazing benefits are you get some amazing collaborations. Your best partners are typically inside of your mastermind groups. One of my favorite things is actually the best way to learn. It's way better than our traditional education system. Here I'm learning from people who are in the weeds doing it every single day as opposed to people that read theory about it in a book. Now I want to tell you about how I created mine so that you get some insights on how you can create yours as well. First things you have to think about as you're deciding to do your mastermind is what's the topic? Like every mastermind has to think around a topic. Some around business building, some around fitness, some around financial planning. Like whatever your market is, you've got to find that group of people that are interested. The second phase is then figuring out who are the right people in the room. Who could actually complement each other? Whose ideas, if they were shared, would actually help the group grow together as opposed to competing and kind of tearing the group down. And really figuring out like what's your space in this ecosystem? Like why is your mastermind different or unique than anybody else's? Why would some come all the way to you to Boise, Idaho, wherever you live to be part of your mastermind group? What is it that makes you special? Mine's called the Inner Circle. What makes our special is really only mastermind groups that specializes in sales funnels and using sales funds to grow your companies. So that niche inside of all business building makes ours unique and makes ours different. You've got to figure out for yourself what makes yours different. And that's what's going to get the right people to come to you and be attracted to your group. Another example of my friend, Stu, he's got a huge mastermind group teaching people how to own membership sites. Another one is Rhonda Swan. She lives all the way out in Bali and she helps people to do branding, but also it's a niche inside of that where people actually want to travel as well. So they're traveling to Bali, they're talking about travel, so it's taking the people who want branding and people want to travel. And that cross-section is what makes her mastermind magic. And so it doesn't matter what market it is you're in, as long as you pick a market and find people inside that market who are interested in your topic and bring those people together and collectively you all grow together. Alright, now one of the most important things when you're building your mastermind is how you get the groups. The first thing is you have to run people through an application. If you let everybody in, you have no idea what kind of crazy people can get into your room and destroy the whole group from the inside out. All I'm saying, they're going to get a... I'm just... Knock, knock. Who's there? You always have to have an application process to get somebody in to make sure the right fit for the group you're trying to build. Number two is when somebody's in there, you have to be protective of your family, of the group you are building. Multiple times, they've had to kick people out because they weren't willing to share or they were takers and not serving the group as a whole. It's going to be willing and okay with actually kicking people out and giving them their money back. And number three is you have to cap how many people are inside of the group. As it started to grow, I decided I was going to cap it off at 100 people, which was the smartest thing I did. Two things happened. Number one is it kept people in. People didn't leave because the group was fine and they didn't want to lose their spot. We call it inner circle for life. If they leave, they can never come back in. So if somebody's in, they're in. And the second thing is that as soon as the spots are filled up, no matter what happens, we do not sell more than our 100 spots. That point, the group is locked out. And that way, it keeps the family atmosphere because as everybody keeps re-upping year in and year out, that family gets tighter and tighter and everybody collectively as a whole, all their companies, all their businesses all grow together and you see a bigger impact amongst the people you're serving when you cap it and keep everybody within. As opposed to having mastermind where new people are coming in and out every single week, every single month, and every single year. So after you got your group and people are signed up for it, you're going to do it. Then the next question is like, where do you do it? Do you do it virtually? Do you do it online? Or do you actually go somewhere to a physical location? I'm a big believer that there's some magic that happens when people are together in a room that you kind of miss when you're just online. So I'm a big believer in getting people into the room. There's two kind of places you can go. Some people like me, who'd like to stay close to home, can do it in their hometown. Or the other idea, which a lot of people do as well, is find a destination location. Go somewhere where people want to go on vacation anyway. Do the mastermind group and then have an extended vacation either before or right after the mastermind as well. Which is a good way to get people to want to go there because not only going for your meeting, they're going to the vacation as well. When people come in the room the very first time, we try not to just allow them to sit anywhere. So they do that. They go sit by their friends and by the different relationships they already have. And when you're super comfortable, it's hard to be vulnerable. So what we do is we actually set the room and we move around the seats so you're not sitting next to people you're super comfortable with. You're sitting next to people who are new so you can get to know them. You can talk about them and it's the easiest way to start opening yourself up. And each day when you come back in, all the seats are mixed up again. So you're never sitting two days in a row next to the same person and that way you get different perspectives and different insights than you would by hanging out with the same friends you know every single time. When they first come through the door, one of the things we give them besides the swag that we have been put on is a notebook. And it's always a new notebook that's completely blank from the very beginning. And the reason why we did that is after the first two or three years of giving out notebooks, we had one of our members, his name is Jamie Amos. He came on stage and he held up three or four of his notebooks he had. He said, I've been the mastermind group now for two years. I've been through four meetings. He said, every one of these notebooks, I feel full of notes when I'm sitting in the room. He said, as I've gone home, every one of these made me at least an extra million dollars. He says, this is four million dollars of value right here in this hand. He said, I'm back excited to start filling out book number five. And ever since then, we've always had a brand new, clean, clear notebook for everyone as soon as they come through the door, because their next million dollar idea is about to be put into that thing. And if they get it, they can take it home and they can execute on it. First, I started really, really small and I didn't really know what I was doing. And if I'm completely honest at first, it was kind of boring. But what I wanted to talk about tonight is kind of a broad overview of the whole internet marketing business. And then I realized one of the secrets is if you run a mastermind group the way you run school, the way you run college, what happens is everybody falls asleep. And so we decided, OK, we have to keep the energy up really, really high if we're going to have a successful experience and people are going to get the most out of the possible. So they come in the door immediately, they always get swagged. When they come into the room, they have to have an ambiance and a feel that feels a little bit different. Because we want this to be like a marketing rave where people are learning, they're enjoying it, but they're not going to fall asleep. That's why we're consistently pumping oxygen in the room. Make sure everybody stays awake. That's not actually true. We don't do that. That'd be awesome. Between every single break, people don't sit. Everyone stands up and they walk and they move. Momentum will move you forward. Momentum keeps you your brain working and functioning at the highest level. I'm going to keep your energy high for two days. It can't be like school. It has to be a different, unique experience. It has to be more like a club than your homeroom. And the second layer is sound. If it's super quiet, it keeps the energy low. We have to keep the energy high again, just like your dance stuff. So we have a DJ. Next, you have to have a whiteboard, but not any kind of whiteboard. It's got to be a big whiteboard with big markers. So as you're doodling fast, people can see everything from the very back of the room. There's nothing worse than mic runners. And everyone's like waiting and it slows the energy down. So we have the mic so you can actually throw across the room, keep the energy high. So the second someone's got a question, you can address it. They can ask the question, throw it back and we keep the motion and keep the momentum moving forward the whole time. Then we have all of the energy drinks. These are essential because most entrepreneurs have ADD and we're not used to sitting in a classroom behind a desk. In fact, most of us struggled or we failed out of school. And so when we're sitting at a desk, it kind of stresses us out. And so we allow people to stand up to move, let them drink energy drinks because we want nobody dozing off, feeling tired, we want to keep the energy level high the entire time. We also have energy gum. This stuff came from the military. If you chew that thing, you will never fall asleep. Next step, we always bring food in. Food that's very paleo, lots of meats, lots of vegetables to make sure that nobody slows down, both mentally or physically as we're going throughout the day. I'm going to walk you through how we run our day here. When the meeting first begins, I usually get up at the very beginning and kind of go through some of the ground rules of how the whole game is going to be played because a lot of times there's new people coming in. So I explain how it's going to work and kind of set the tone for the day. Welcome to your circle, everybody. So excited to have you guys here today. Immediately after that, then I transitioned into the biggest takeaways that I've gotten since the last six months I've been here. As a facilitator, I want to make sure that I'm always bringing the best, the newest, the coolest stuff to share with them, stuff they wouldn't see anywhere else. They're not going to see it in the product course or online anywhere else. It's just the stuff that we're seeing behind the scenes. I just open up the curtains. I give them everything that we're doing to see exactly what we're doing so they can then take those things and implement it back in their business. So being the first isn't the key, but it's like understanding how to actually design and execute on a category. When you do that and you become the category king, that's almost a possible to be you, right? Then we break down and we have each person gets a chance to get up on stage and talk about their business. So the way it begins is I grab the mic box and I scream with their name at the top of the lungs. We get everybody to stand up and give them a huge round of applause so we can set the tone and the energy right. Then have their song start playing as they walk up on stage. They're given 30 minutes of time to go and present to the audience. The first 10 to 15 minutes, they have a chance to share their story and then give anything that they've got that they've learned inside their business and even big takeaways, their big a-has and things that are working the best for them. They just give those to the group. One of the biggest rules is you always provide value first before you ever ask for value back in exchange. After they provided as much value as they can to the group, then the last 15 minutes, they transition and this is where they get asked the group for help. Here's the things that are working on, things that are stuck, things they're not sure about, things that they, they're thinking about doing. They want feedback in the group before they actually do that. But we don't hold things back. We tell them exactly what, not what they want to hear, but what they need to hear. We give them actual proof and validation of, Hey, we tried this in my business and it didn't work. We started over here and it didn't work. Instead, you should be doing this. Sometimes it's brutal. Sometimes people's dreams and visions and plans. We kind of destroy them, but afterwards we rebuild them back up and give them a foundation they need to actually move forward. So that way when they go back home and they start running, they're running in the right direction. There's nothing worse than running and doing everything right, but you're running in the wrong direction. And so we course correct, we get them on the right path and make sure they're running towards the right target. When they do that, they get to where they're trying to get to a lot faster. And that's the goal of the mastermind. After you get off stage, then I grab the mic and I yell back, all right, everyone stand up and you're going to walk and talk and share with the rest of the group, the biggest takeaway you got from that person's presentation. They have a chance to then grab a new partner, walk around the room and share the biggest a-ha that they got from that person's presentation. One of the amazing byproducts of the mastermind that you don't plan on when you show up, that happens every single time is that you think you're going to get the most value when you're on stage. Typically what happens is while you're paying attention, serving that person, that's when you get the biggest a-has for your own personal business. So as you're listening with those ears, listening for the a-has coming back down to you and you grab those things and as you walk and talk, you share them with the partner next to you. When you share them, it solidifies them, it's immense them into your mind. It actually gives you something you can use when you go back home. As we walk around the room, we walk and talk, we keep the energy high while we're switching up and get the next person prepared for their chance to be on stage. When it's all over, the last thing we do at the end of the day, number two is I allow every single person in the room to share the biggest takeaway they got. The biggest problems you have when you come to something like this, you've got a notepad full of thousands of different ideas. But which one are you going to actually execute on? So I've ever spent a few minutes and looked through everything and see like, what's the biggest takeaway? If you were to take just one idea, one thought, one impression from the last two days, what would be the thing you'd implement that have the biggest impact on your life and on your business? And maybe everyone go around the room and share their biggest takeaway. What's interesting is that all of us sat in the same room, all of us heard the same presentation, all of us saw and experienced the same thing, but every single person's biggest takeaway is different. A lot of times they got a different takeaway that I didn't even hear when I heard that exact same presentation. And it's amazing because I hear that. I'm like, oh my gosh, I totally missed that. I'm able to get the biggest of hearts from each person in the group. And a lot of times I end up rearranging my takeaways and my order of priorities because of that. And that's the best way to kind of end the mastermind group because it gives you a chance to get a different perspective on what was the most impactful from the entire experience. And then after the mastermind is over each night and throughout the weekend afterwards, we have what we call the aftermind, which is where everyone gets together, they network and they keep the party happening to keep the energy to keep networking even into the night to help build the relationships even stronger, help them to understand each other, be help each other more. And then we keep that happening all throughout the night during the aftermind. They say that entrepreneurship is the most lonely job in the world and it is. You're sitting there on your computer with your mind and a lot of times the people around you don't know what you're going through. They don't understand what you're going through. Even if it's your wife or your family, like they love you, but they don't understand it. And I've watched over the last five or six years I've been running this inner circle, people who didn't have anything came into this program and watched as they grew from the seed of an idea inside their mind, companies that do millions of dollars a year in sales. And it's been interesting to see as this group, they went from being colleagues and acquaintances to friends to now family. And we look at it from the outside, it may seem kind of simple. It's not a super complicated process, but what happens inside of these walls, it changes people's lives. When someone is there with you during your down times, when they experience the pain of your sacrifice, they celebrate the wins with you 10 times more than anybody else. And that's the power of having a family mastermind group like this. So if you don't have a mastermind group yet, go and find one. Find your tribe, find your group of people you can connect with, you can grow with, you can serve together. And if for some reason there's not a mastermind group in whatever market you're in, then now you have my permission. You have the tools now to go and start your own. So that means get your energy drinks, get your disco lights, get your swag, get your notebooks, get your tribe, your people together and change the lives of the people you're going to serve.
