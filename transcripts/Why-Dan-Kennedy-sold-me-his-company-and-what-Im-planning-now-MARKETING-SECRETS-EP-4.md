And with that said, you guys, we're gonna jump into the podcast. I hope you're enjoying this episode. You're listening to Marketing Secrets with your host, Russell Brunson. Some backstory for those who don't know who Dan Kennedy is. He is, a lot of them consider him like the godfather of marketing. He was one of the first, if not the first people that really was in this industry, not just doing it, but also teaching other people how to do it. He's been big. He was behind the scenes of writing infomercials for Gunty Ranker and a bunch of big companies you'd be aware of, but he's been in the trenches forever. And then I think 1996 is when he published his very first version of the NoBS marketing letter. I don't have a copy of that one here, but I do have a copy of this one from May 2002. So those of you watching the video, you can see it's this newsletter. And it's like black and white, 10 pages stapled together. And this was their newsletter. And this is the backbone of Kennedy's company. So he launched it in 1996, I believe. The company was called Kennedy Inner Circle, KIC. And then eventually Dan was like, I don't wanna be running a business. I wanna do content, but I wanna do business anymore. And so one of the people in his mastermind was Bill Glazer. And he actually sold the company to Bill Glazer. And Bill Glazer rebranded it as GKICs. And it's said for Glazer Kennedy Inner Circle. In fact, one funny side note, I spoke at a, I joined the mastermind. I was like all in drinking the Kool-Aid. I was in the mastermind for six years. And my last year there before Bill had sold the company, they had me speak on stage and I gave four presentations. And I joked because I actually spent more time on stage than Dan did in this event. And so my slides, I took the GKIC logo and I rebranded it as a GKBIC. I was like, this is the Glazer Kennedy Bruntz at the Inner Circle meeting. Thanks so much for being here. I kept calling it that. Apparently Bill didn't think it was funny. I was in that world for six years. I was in Bill's masterminds. He was my, honestly, my first big mentor. And Bill and Dan, I just learned so much from him. Even to this day, people always asked me, where do you learn marketing from? I'm like, I listen to Dan Kennedy almost daily to this day because he still brings the best insights. So what's now certainly now? What is Bill? Resentment of what's new? Back when Bill owned the company, I had a really unique insight. I got to know Bill really well. I had a chance to see behind the scenes what they were doing at a pretty deep level. And so Bill's whole thought, in fact, Bill told me, I'm in the two things of business. I'm in the business of getting customers and the business of retaining customers. That's all I do. Everything else is an appendage to that. That was the two things. And so he was all about how do I get people and how do I get them to stick? When I got into the Kennedy world, Bill launched an offer that they called the MIFKI. And MIFKI stands for Most Incredible Free Gift Ever. And it was a big package of like $630 and money-making stuff for free when you joined the No BS newsletter. So I signed up for it back in the day. I got a kit in the mail. And then the newsletter started coming. I get a newsletter every single month. And I would read it and it was like having a conversation with Danny Kennedy, which was super fun. Eventually I joined the Mastermind Group. And I remember Bill walking me through the process. He said that they have funnels, you can call them funnels back then, because we have offers like the MIFKI that acquire new customers. And after we acquire a customer, our goal then is to ascend the customer. And so inside of their company, they had different levels. They had a gold level, then a diamond level, and then like a peak performer, a Lattener level, and then a Platinum and a Titanium. And they were five or six different levels. And I remember that he said that they had someone on their team that was specifically in charge of marketing to each level. The other big thing I learned from Bill and from Dan is when you went to their events, you'll notice that I do some funnel hacking live a lot. When I would speak at a GKIC event, they never said, this is Internet Marketing nerd, Russell Brunson, come on stage. They'd say, this is titanium member, Russell Brunson. They labeled me by the level of membership I was. And you notice that the people on stage are always a Platinum and Titanium member. So if you want to be on stage, like I have to be a Platinum and Titanium member. You probably know some funnel hacking live. People always ask me, how do you get on stage? Well, notice how we introduce them. This is two common club members so-and-so speaking. This is inter-circle members so-and-so speaking. We label them as we introduce them with the level of membership that they're at, which makes people want to ascend up, right? Mastermind was in Baltimore where Bill lived. I remember I was sitting at the table and we're in this big U-shaped Mastermind table, something that they're presenting. I was sitting next to Bill and Bill was kind of being fidgety. And I was like, everything okay? He's like, I'm just waiting for something. I'm like, what? I sold GKIC. I'm like, what? He's like, yeah, the wire's supposed to hit today. I'm like, how much do you sell it for? He's like, I can't tell you, but I can tell you that as soon as this wire lands, I'll never have to work again. And I was like, what? He's like, don't tell anybody. I'm like, I'm the worst secret keeper ever. You can't tell me to not tell someone and then I'm gonna go tell, like I was just kind of freaking out. But I was so excited, right? And then he sold the company and then it went downhill fast. The company sold to, he was a PE firm who, and hopefully they're watching this. They didn't know what they were doing. They didn't understand the business that they bought. They had nothing to do with like the focus of the business is to get members and keep members. And these guys, this PE firm, they ended up going through, I don't know, six or seven different CEOs throughout the time. They ended up burning it to the ground. They offended most of the existing members, like me and other people. And it got smaller and smaller and smaller. It's the point where I don't know all the stats and the details. Like that point where basically it kind of died on the vine. And about that time, they were gonna fire sell it or something. And Adam Witte, who was a GKIC member, he owns four books. Adam was a friend of Dan's and basically Dan said, hey, Adam, you should buy it. And so Adam bought it and then Adam owned the company. And so Adam, when he bought the company, Dan was working with him. And then about a year into it, as you guys know, that's when Dan almost passed away. Poor Adam, he's got his new business. He's trying to launch it. The face of it kind of, we all thought he died and then he came back and then he wasn't able to work for like a year. Just, and we got a point where it's just, the burden came too heavy for Adam as well. About a year ago, right now actually, is when I got a message from Adam saying like, hey, would you be interested in buying this company? Obviously I was like, yes, that'd be amazing. And so we had it and I write for Funal Hacking Live. And that's when I was signing my contracts with Dan, I was like, speak at Funal Hacking Live. And then he's like, do you want to do a promotional to promote it? I'm like, no, we're not telling anybody. This is going to be the greatest secret of all time. And so we didn't tell anybody. And then obviously FHL Dan came on stage. And those who were there, he freaked out and it was awesome. And for most people, they thought, didn't know he had survived his accidents and stuff. And so a lot of people were just excited to see him. And it was just, it was a magical moment. And that was in what September of last year. So then from September to December is when we can set back and say, okay, we got to figure out this business. Like what is it doing? What's happened in the last decade since Bill sold it? What's good? What's bad? And luckily there were a handful of like rock star team members from the original team that were still around. And so we flew them out to Boise, we made a chance to look at everything, look at the numbers, like here's what's working, here's what's not working, here's what's, and just seeing all sorts of things. And so for the most part we did is we almost shut off everything. I was like, let's just shut down everything. And then slowly relaunch things in the sequential order that makes sense. And so for me, the very first thing was like, well, how did Bill launch this company? He created a MFK. And basically give an insane gift. You cover shipping and handling, and you get a month worth of the newsletter. And number two is like, and I wanted to launch the new newsletter in January, just cause I don't know, I wanted to start in January. So someday I can find these in 12 month books or whatever. So I was like, January 1st, we're launching the new version of the newsletter, and we got to make a new one. And then we had big dates back and forth. Cause Dan Kennedy was like, Dan's like, I want it to be black and white, stapled together. Like that's what it's supposed to be. And in the past, like I've done newsletters like magazines and he's like, no, in fact, one of the versions, someone who owned the company one time, turned into a magazine and all the members hated it. Cause it's like, I feel like I paid five bucks in a newsstand for this versus a hundred bucks for this paper off Dan's fax machine or whatever. And so we kind of made a middle ground where we designed a version that's not a stapled together, black and white, but it's not a magazine. It's kind of this individual version. And so we created a new newsletter. And then my biggest fear was like, we've got Dan's audience, and we have the ClickFunnels audience. I'm like, I know that Dan's audience is gonna love Dan. So that's awesome. And I was like, I'm afraid that my audience isn't gonna spend enough time to really get to know Dan to stick with him, right? So I had this fear that all the ClickFunnels community coming here, getting to know BS newsletter and they would leave because they wouldn't get it. I was like, if we're gonna get people to stick, like I love to have something for both sides. Plus all the Kennedy people need more internet stuff. I don't wanna show people behind the scenes of the online campaigns that we're running. And so that's what we decided to do is instead of having one newsletter to have two, which is a big undertaking. Like now we're writing two newsletters a month, which is a lot. I mean, each of these is like 20 to 40 to 50 pages. I mean, it's almost writing like 50 or 60 pages newsletter every single month. 800, almost a thousand pages a year. I guess it's like publishing two books a year on marketing with Dan Kennedy. So it's a lot of work on this side and it's taken us a couple months to get in the process of it. But now finally we have a process and the thing that it's been working in like people are, even like the old timers who didn't like the newsletter when we first came out with it. Now we're like, okay, this is turning out really good. You've done a good job. I'm like, thank you, but it's been really cool. So again, if you don't have these letters, like it's our best stuff delivered every single month to your mailbox. So if you don't have it, like you need to get it. You'd be insane not to, but this is the business, right? So the first phase of our business, like how do we grow the newsletter, right? Bill Glazer 101, like step number one is how do we get new members? And so the MIFKI obviously launched and we've been buying ads and creating things. We've had about 6,000 people now who have, I think it was like 6,006 this morning who have got the MIFKI, which is amazing. Right now, 71% of the people stay through the first month billing, which is insane. Most continuity programs are like half of that. So we're really proud of the initial thing of keeping members at least through the first billing. We're still working on keeping them longer, but it's been really, really good. The business has already 100% paid itself off and it's profitable, which is obviously exciting and amazing. $350,000 a month, I think it's coming from their newsletter revenue, which is great. My big goal is obviously is like keep feeling this. And so the first question, I'm sure some of you guys are thinking, okay, we have this newsletter, you promote it, you've driven ads, like how do you scale faster? And that's the question I keep asking myself as well. Obviously Dan has written like 40 different books. So now we're coming back and building book funnels. And the goal of the book funnel is to get people into the MIFKI offer. So the first one we're doing is Dan wrote two books, one's called the ultimate sales letter, one's called the ultimate business plans. And this is another exciting thing. So Dan and I are working on a book together and I think the time, like 90% sure the title of the book is gonna be called the ultimate sales funnel. What? It'll be a trilogy of the ultimate sales letter, ultimate business model, and then the ultimate sales funnel, which is gonna be so exciting. So working on that right now. And so that's all about getting new customers. So now that's all in place. Now the next step is okay, what's the next level? The next thing is like, okay, how do we, like what's the process to send somebody from gold into diamond? And so we wanted to basically create a new MIFKI. Now we're not calling this the MIFKI, but it is like what's an offer we can create. It's so good, it's so powerful, they can only get it, they ascend to become a diamond member. When we bought Dan's company, I got a hard drive with everything he's created in the last 40 years, which is like a gold mine going through. As I was going through everything, I found this one folder that was called diamond faxes. And I knew there's a diamond level member, so what are the diamond faxes? I opened up, I started reading them, and these were faxes. And I talked to Molly who has been with the company forever. I said, Molly, what are these diamond faxes? She said, well, from 2012 to 2019, if you know Dan Kenney, he doesn't have an email. He just faxes things to people. So he would fax all of his diamond members, the fax of like his thoughts of the week, like the best marketing strategies, the best personal development, the best whatever he was excited about that week. He'd read one page fax and he'd fax it to all the diamond members. Don't people ever see these are the people that were on diamond during that little window of time who actually had a fax machine. So most of the world's never seen this stuff and it is insanely good. And so I'm a book nerd. So I was like, I want these in a book. And so we published them together in this book. And then right now this book is 446 pages long with I think 360 something faxes from Dan Kennedy directly to diamond members. So because it was just for diamond members, I was like, this is the hook, this is the Mifki. So the offer, in fact, you can see this, if you go to diamondupgrade.com, you get a free copy of this book when you upgrade to diamond. There's the hook, there's the thing you get people in, right? This is the sexy thing. If you're trying to get something to ascend to the next level or to stick or whatever, like what is the sexy thing they want so bad? Like diamond members want this. I'm hoping you want this. I wanted this. Like it is one of my favorite books that we've ever, anyway, it's amazing. So the next question is like, what do diamond members get? Each month Dan does a masterclass. They're just for diamond members. These are like full video production. We can sit down and listen to Dan, which are amazing. Another cool thing we had inherited was they created Dan Kennedy's search engine, which basically goes back to all the newsletters, back to like 1996 and put them in the search engine where you could go and type in Disney and it shows all of the times that Dan's ever written about Disney. You can go find those. You can type in Russell Brunson. You see all the times that he ever mentioned me. You can type in whatever. And so we create the search engine, we plug that in, which is really good as well, right? So the search engine, they sell for two grand. You get his diamond member. The book as a diamond member. And then I was like, how do we, I want people to stick on. I never want them to leave. Like what do we have that's sticky? And one thing that Bill used to always tell me is like, stick is about creating painted disconnect. We're traditionally with info product membership sites that stuff there's no painted disconnect. Like you cancel, you cancel, right? And so for diamond, like how do we create a painted disconnect? And then we had this idea. And when I used to go to Kennedy's events back in the day, they would like sell all their different courses. But then if you go back to them, they had all the courses like on this big huge thing. And they had one product called the whole enchilada, which is basically like 25 or 30 grand and he would just ship you one of everything. And it was so cool. It's called a whole enchilada. So I was like, what if we gave people who came diamond a whole enchilada? I mean, the problem is then you log in and you're like, here's every course stands I've ever had which is kind of cool. But I was like, would it be more powerful? And to get people to stick is like, what if we create this whole enchilada? But they have access to everything, but they only get to pick like one or two courses a month, right? And it's every course stands ever created in the last 40 years that are all in there. And each month you log in, you get two tokens or two credits or whatever it is. You unlock a course, right? So you're like, oh, I want a speaking from stage. You click a button and unlocks it. Now you have access to it and they have it for forever. But if you ever cancel, you lose access to all the ones you've unlocked, right? Each month you unlock more and more similar how audible does it, right? And other companies. And so we're building that infrastructure and the members are right now. It should be done before this officially goes live here soon. But it's the goal. Again, here's the offer to get people to send up and then have me give them a stick. We make it where there's pain and disconnect. We unlock things and give them things, but then if they leave, they lose these things, right? You could go resign up and then you got to go and each month earn your courses back until you have all the different courses. And so just some things we're doing strategically. And again, we haven't launched Diamond yet. I don't know what the conversions or numbers or anything are going to be, but that's the things we're doing because we know that's the next tier to really get people in here. Other things I want to kind of mention, just again, visualizing where I'm going in the future. So we've got the gold level, we got the Diamond level. I do know there's going to be a third level, which is going to be our high ticket level. I don't know what that is yet. Some of you guys have been watching ClickFunnels. You know, we recently launched our certification program, which sold really, really well. Part of it's thinking about launching like a marketing, consulting, certification program that goes based off Dan's teachings. I'm not sure about that. Again, I'm always looking at like, what are the different funnels, different businesses and different industries that are working well? People always ask like, why do you buy that company? Why do you buy it? And there are a couple of reasons, right? There's a reason like I want to work with Dan Kennedy. Number two, I want to extend his legacy. Like he's had such impact on me, I want to do it. Number three, like I love this game, like building funnels, these things are so much fun. Finding like diamonds in the rough, like Dan Kennedy's faxes is like, it's like treasure hunting. Like it's so much fun. I'm enjoying that part of it. But what also had done like the reason why we're building this company is because three years ago, I had this thought like, we need to create more non-rustle based front ends. Like if I'm the front end of everything in click funnels, then if I hit by a bus, what happens to click funnels? Or someday we want to sell click funnels. Boom, the book fell, the fax book fell. And so when we look at Dan Kennedy, he's got 40 books he's written. He's got newsletters, he's got courses, he's got books. He's got all these amazing things. I think these are a whole bunch of non-rustle based front ends I can use to get people who are marketers, who are entrepreneurs into a conversation where now I can expose them to click funnels and the mind books and other things like that. As much fun and as profitable as this business is in and of itself without anything else, it's core goal, it's core purpose for existing and being is to find people and either turn them into entrepreneurs or find entrepreneurs, bring them in, train them on good marketing principles and then from there send them into click funnels. As much fun as I'm having this company if it wasn't for that purpose, it doesn't make a lot of sense. I think those are the core things I want to talk about right now inside of the Dan Kennedy business. So that's some of the reasons why we did it, how we're doing it, where it came from, where it's going, what we're doing and hopefully from that you got insights of how you can use some of these principles in your business, how to get people to sign up for your newsletters or your membership sites or whatever, how do you get them to stick, how do you get them to send after that, like where do you take people, what's the process? I hope this gives you some ideas for that. So that's the things you guys so much for listening.
