I had some ups and downs in businesses and everything had kind of collapsed for me. I was like, let's stop teaching how to make money. Let's get back and actually doing the business. So I'm talking about how I got excited about physical products first. First year at 2CCX, maybe the second year we sent a copy of the 12 month millionaire to everybody. Anyway, it's like one of my favorite books of all time. It's this fab book and it's interesting. The guy who wrote it, his name is Vince James and he made $100 million in 23 months selling supplements through Direct Mail, pre-internet. And this book is like the guide to how he did it. So 16 years ago, I got this book and I remember reading it and I was just blown away. I was like, how is this even possible? Like I was freaking out, reading this whole book and I had a chance afterwards actually, I emailed the author. I was like, dude, this is insane. Can I interview you about how you did this? And it was really cool. He actually let me interview him. He's like, write up all your questions, we'll jump on a call and you can record it. So I recorded it and we spent a whole Saturday. I spent three hours recording it and into three hours I had answered half my questions. And he's like, hey, come back next Saturday. We'll do this again. I'm like, are you serious? So a week later, I did the next three hours. We had a six hour call with him. I had to ask him all my questions about how he did this. And it was crazy because he told the story about how he found the product and how he discovered it and how he like got his own label done and got it created. And then how he wrote the sales letter and the first one didn't work and the second didn't work and then the one that hit. Now it blew up and then we took to magazines. And I remember just in my head, like hearing him tell these stories about the supplement he'd built up. And I wanted to supplement so bad. Like that's all I could think about. Like I want to supplement someday. And so my head, I knew someday I was going to do a supplement company, but I didn't know when. Funny side story is two years after the interview was done, I was selling information products at the time. And I was like trying to figure out what should my next offer be? And I was like, oh, remember I interviewed Vince James? Like I wonder if I could sell that. So I asked him, I was like, can I sell our interview? He's like, yeah, like if you make money with a go for it, man, took the interview and we put it together as an offer. We launched it. It was the very first product, every first offer I ever did that did a million dollars. It was my first like two comic club thing. In fact, when we created the two comic club award, the very first two comic award was printed was for this fund. I was like, my first fund was this, we printed one. It said 12th millionaire Russell Brunson 1998, or whatever it was. And that was the very first one I ever got was for this product. And it was cool because it was also having me the very first product we ever had an upsell with. And back in the day it was different. It wasn't like nowadays, you just have one click upsells. So someone to buy the interview and then I had licensed the book from Vince James. So someone to buy the interview for like, I think 37 bucks. And then the upsell, there was a video of me, it was a YouTube video, I had the book and I was like, hey, you just got the thing, you want the book as well? And it was crazy though, like 30% of people bought the book and it blew up and hit two comic club and it was the best offer I had ever done to that point. So then fast forward, after I had some ups and downs in businesses and some of you guys have heard this story, like everything had kind of collapsed for me. I was like, well, let's stop teaching how to make money. Like I've done, Vince James interview a bunch of other products like that. I'm like, let's just stop and let's get back and actually doing the business. And you can ask Brent was there for these days. I was like, hey, we should launch whatever. So we started launching a company, we launched one company, got at the point we was doing like two or $3 million a year. Like we'll have one business doing two or $3 million a year. What if I launched 10? And they used to do $3 million a year, then it'd be a 20 or $30 million a year. And so what happened, we launched the first one, got the, you know, got it making money and then we launched the second one and then third one and fourth one and we launched I think 12 companies one year. And then we had these all going. What happened is that the one that was making $2 million a year, the revenue dropped and then one of them grew and then the end of the calendar year, we'd made $2 or $3 million. And like nothing had shifted other than like a whole bunch more work and we kept going back and forth. But in that interim of those things happening, we're trying to come up like, business about like, what'd be fun? I was like, I want to do a supplement. And so that was the first thing we had to do a supplement. So this business was out of spite. I guess it's the best way to say it. I didn't know what I wanted to be a supplement company around but I had these guys who hired me as a client this is when I was doing client work. And if you guys ever had a client, we did a whole bunch of work for him, he made a bunch of money and then they don't pay you. We launched his business form, it was super successful. I wrote the scripts, I wrote the copy, I trained the sales people, we did everything. Like I just killed myself in exchange for equity and the company was awesome. We get it done, we get launched, we get live. We took the first location they'd done it for, took him two years to fill, we did the next one we filled in three months and it was amazing. I'm like, this is awesome. I'm like, hey, so when did I get paid? And the guy's like, well, the thing is like, it wasn't you that did it, it was our sales guys that did it. And so like, we don't feel comfortable giving you what we promised you because like the sales guys did it and you didn't. And I was like, the sales guys I hired that I trained that I wrote the scripts for, like those sales guys, they, yeah, but they did it. You didn't do it. Literally like, I didn't get a penny off of all the effort. I was super mad, but I was like, whatever, move on in my life. And then a couple of years later that company went up and went bankrupt. And then I was in a Dan Kennedy event. I was speaking on stage. I'm speaking, I look at the audience and I see the guy in the sun out in the audience. I was like, huh, that's interesting. I was like, so annoyed. And I do my presentation, I get done. And afterwards, like, I did sales, close the sales in the back of the room and they're kind of lingering and then it gets done and everyone leaves and they're there like, hey, can we talk to you for a minute? They gave me a side and literally took me to dinner that night and they told me that this new business, this new supplement company they're launching, they want to be a partner in it. And literally the guy said, man, Russell, we would have realized how successful you were gonna become. We wouldn't have screwed you over like that. And I was like, I always thought that you thought that but you just said that out loud out of your mouth. Like you literally, I was like, I can't believe, I was just like, I was just, I was so perplexed. I was like, I don't even know what to do with myself right now. And they just been pinching me on the supplement company they were creating to sell a supplement helping people with diabetic neuropathy. And I was like, no. I was like, are you kidding me? Like you and I were so mad and they went off and for them, luckily for them, they had success with this company. They blew up, they live here locally. So some of you guys may even know them. They had success with it. And so when I came back, we launched supplement company. What should we do supplement on? I was like, we should compete with those guys because they're horrible humans and we should totally compete with them. And then I think Brent was like, well, what's diabetic neuropathy? I'm like, I don't know. I don't even care. We're gonna compete with them and we're gonna win. And so that's kind of, this company was completely built out of spite. So now it's on camera. So that's the backstory. So we create the supplement, we get it done, we get it out there, we launch the website because that's what you do and like nothing happened. No money came from it, right? Dang it. So then I met Ed O'Keefe and I knew he had a supplement that was doing well. So I messaged him, I was like, he has this whole thing work and he showed me his funnel. And I think at the time they were doing like $3 million a month in this funnel. And I remember going through it and it was different than what I'd seen my friends who had stolen from me were doing. And so I wanted to go through the process and this was their process. He had a VSL was really good at the cart and then the order form had the option people could buy one, three or four bottles. And after you bought them, the next step sell was six more bottles of the same thing. I remember it talking to Ed, I was like, dude, that's stupid. I was like, they just bought four bottles. They don't need six more. And I remember fighting with this. He's like, no, dude, I test this, it works. I promise. And I'm like, I was like, I have other offers I'll plug in that spot. He's like, trust me, do not plug in other offers in that spot. He's like, best case scenario, offer number two is gonna convert like 20, 30% like this one will convert like 50. The people want more the same thing they just bought it to discount. He's like, if they understand the psychology we've tested this and so we went through and they showed me the rest of the funnel. At the time, this is what the funnel actually looked like. And so this became for me the new control. I was like, okay, this is the control. This is what we have to model to be successful. Right? So for me, my control becomes a doodle. This was the doodle. I'm like, okay, this is our supplement business. This is the control. This is what works currently. He's killing it. I saw other people afterwards who had been modeling him. There's a whole bunch of people who do supplements and all of them kind of model the same. This process was very, very similar. Right? So this became our control. When you get an offer that works, you can blow these things up. That's what the key I understand is like, there are ways to blow these things up when they work. But the key is like this. And so if you look at like the e-commerce funnel game in my world, this is kind of how it works. Right? On the back end, we have some kind of store. In a lot of the age, you Shopify. In the near future, you'll be using a new tool I can't talk to you about, but after funnel, I can have you a little more about it. But there's the store, right? It has your e-commerce, your physical products in there. Driving traffic to an e-commerce store you guys know is not productive. It doesn't, like the conversions are low. There's no upsells or down. Like it's just, it's hard to make the metrics numbers work. So what you do is you take that, you pull out, you build a supplement funnel that's goal is to get customers in. Right? For example, here's our nerve cell funnel. We had our smart nerve health store that had all the products and the things reorders went here. Other things went here where people can go and buy products and stuff like that. The email sequences pushed to the store afterwards. But all of our paid media went to this front end funnel. Right? So traffic control went there, traffic control, everything went to this funnel. And we focused on optimization of the average cart value to the point we got it from, again, $120, $150 to $180. And then lowering your CPA, which is on the ad side. And as soon as you get that spread, then it's like you scale like crazy. And even if we were spending $180 to make $180, it was okay because we're profitable. We break even here and all the money comes through pushing people to the follow-up funnels. I can show you guys tons of case studies of people inside of ClickFunnels who sell supplements or physical products where their front end funnels is how they break even, how they get customers in and then they push people through email to their store and that's where their profit comes from. And so that's kind of the model for a lot of these things. Figuring out one good funnel that brings customers in and then from there on the back and pushing them into your stores and things like that. you
