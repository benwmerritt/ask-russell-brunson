There's just been so many tools out there. Very few have been aggregated to do everything you need to do to create success. ClickFunnels came out of nowhere. They took the marketplace by storm, just like Apple did when they first launched the iPhone. ClickFunnels allows you to sell a product online quicker and faster than anything you've ever seen in your life. It's just a simple way of making pages that convert. I mean, they're like business-oriented templates that already start beautiful that you can very easily customize. I can be one guy sitting in a basement somewhere with a dream and a picture in my head and in like no time at all I've got this finished product and it's not just a mock-up. Dude, it's a finished product. It's just drag and drop instead of coding. I think that most people, when they hear technology, they get scared. They don't have to be scared anymore. It's taking the sales process from in-person and just transferring the exact thing online. Rather than taking a shotgun and blasting an entire market, you take this targeted approach and find the people who really are coming towards you already and help them along. You can lead them through the steps of, okay, here's who we are, here's what we do. Would you like to get some more information? Yes, okay, great. So I had someone ask me that the other day. They said, you know, what business can you use it with? And I said everything. We help Jim scale their businesses. And we're in the weight loss industry. I have goats. Teaching people how to do e-commerce. We have a coaching company. I'm an Instagram marketer. An organic skincare company. We teach entrepreneurs how to do product launches. I help people write and publish books. An advertising agency. And I'm the executive director of a nonprofit. I'm a content creator. I'm a blogger. Before ClickFunnels, I probably would have gone bankrupt in my business. It's actually a funnel that got me out of homelessness. I actually still use it today. No one knew me. And now I have a global audience. Literally been an impetus between my business not even being in existence to a multi-six figure level. One year from the seat to the stage. From zero to a million-dollar education business in five months. Having a business that's made massive impact to over 100,000 customers and generated overtaken $10 million. It's just I could have never saw it coming. The last thing in the world at ClickFunnels is it was a software. It really is a culture. It's the way of life. Like you get in an environment. You get a team. You know, they truly want to see you have success. And whatever your dreams are, they want to help you get there. You get these people that are with millions of dollars and they're just sharing with you. And I have never in my life seen an owner of a business care more about the success of the people who give him money than he cares about his own money. Everybody's just one funnel away from having the life they've always wanted. It's given me the key to freaking having a fulfilled and amazing life. The fact that we have a reliable marketing and sales system like ClickFunnels just makes life that much easier. Whatever I'm doing online from this point forward, we're going to build it out on ClickFunnels because it's just superior. We started ClickFunnels with the goal of helping entrepreneurs like you to actually free themselves. And now we want to help free you. Let us know what type of business you're in and I'll tell you the exact funnels that'll work best for you and for your company.
