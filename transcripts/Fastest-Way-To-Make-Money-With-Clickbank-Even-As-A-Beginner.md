Hey, this is Russell Brunson and Jim and I made a really cool video for anyone who's trying to figure out how to get started online How to be an affiliate and in this video we showed you how to use funnels and click bank to make a ton of money ton of affiliate commissions creating very simple opt-in funnels That basically will help you sell products as an affiliate through click bank. Well, and if you ever use click bank before They're super simple and easy to use that basically set up a funnel drive some traffic make some sales And they send you checks in the mail or they can wire your money in your bank as well But it's really awesome super simple process check out the video and you'll see exactly how to do it for your business as well Yeah, well, let's explain what we're gonna do today. Okay Everybody kind of knows and basically what we're gonna do is this was a cool idea because a lot of people like well I don't have a product yet. I don't know So what we said is you know if you don't have a product one of the ways to test a market certainly is to sell someone else's Product as an affiliate so you can start building your tribe and seeing whether or not you can resonate with the people sell make affiliate commissions Then eventually come out with your own product, right? Boom. That is so What's the biggest marketplace of affiliate? Offers that basically anybody can sell click bank. Do I have an offer we're doing it for well, I thought we'd pick one Okay, maybe I mean I found I found one that's actually the three-week diet What I was hoping we could do also is just talk about Russell because I know used to do it I used to do a ton of bridge pages. I know you did bridge pages and stuff So just talk about maybe with the whiteboard what what a bridge pay are you and Julie actually? Let's have Julie tell us on the whiteboard what a bridge page should be and do okay So bridge page is basically so when you are selling an affiliate product the way that it It works is that you have to become the bridge between the customer and the person who's selling the product So a bridge page acts as like your salesman like if you can't actually be there in person to be like hey I tried this great product. It's amazing like let me tell you about my story like let's say you're selling I don't know whatever skin cream and you had eczema You would normally in real life tell them the story about how you had eczema and how hard it was And nothing worked and then eventually you found a product that worked and you would tell them this story What would happen like they'd be like oh, well, let me try it or oh my mom needs it So online you need to create that exact same environment Digitally and so the bridge page acts as your way of telling your story giving context creating a hook For why this product matters so that by the time they get through the bridge page They're totally sold and they're ready to go by so listening to what Julie was saying One of the best ways to create a bridge page is around a testimonial or case study So that's one of the best ways so if you think about the structure of a bridge page, what does it? What's it gonna need to have it's got to have a headline hook. It's got it should have a video All right, we'll see this is the click bank product right what we call this is the three-week diet three Three-week diet diet This is the bridge page that Julie so perfectly explained what I will she's saying that I Really agrees typically what I'll do is have like an opt-in page first It's got like this really big curiosity base headline CBH curiosity base headline Cory Barton Holmes That's the big homebillier boysie. They opt in then they're taken to this. It's a good headline here Maybe a little brunson box or something down here with a link then pushes people to here The only thing I add is so Julie did a good job I got this is like the salesperson builds the context for why you care about this and get you excited Other thing that I like using this page right here for is to up the offer So like if you're an affiliate there's like 500 other people all promoting the same three-week diet And so it's like why would they buy for me versus everybody else? So I would be like hey on the next page in the three-week diet If you just you can go to directly buy it if you want, but if you want If you buy through my link down below, I'm gonna do something really special What I'm gonna do for you first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you one of these amazing Superman USB drives Recipes on it and so we'll send you this plus I'm gonna send you Some toothpicks because all of the diet food is green and it gets stuck inside your teeth And this way you can get it out of your teeth plus I'm gonna give you a bottle head Russell's all you can pick from either the green this one or the Batman one and you And that's if you buy right now you can get the gym hours bottle head to Three bobble heads for the price of one. I bet a lot of people are asking like how do you actually technically pull that off? Do is you just tell them to send you the receipt once you're done and then that's how you deliver the products Step two semi-receive in step three I think you the gift. This is the secret. This is this is the difference between Don't like that. Oh, you make a little money. Oh, the other thing is cool You get the email address then you can send them an email here and they send them another email here and another one And then another one you can like have her get to them You take away this thing and then what happens is say they buy through diet Then you get oh one of the things that people who are diets like to buy and they're like, oh, I like to buy food your ice cream Keto drink that's in my whole cup right and you're like, I'm gonna join MLM called keep called proven over here So you joined proven MLM and then these people over here who you know like through diet They're like hey by the way, you can do the diet But how would you like to get the toasts at the same time with booms are selling this and all of a sudden I don't want to feel it inside approve it and then you're like, oh, well, what about organify? I like green drinks. We got my organify affiliate And then you tell people like being a kid goes good But drinking greens even better and then you get and you just take these people on his customer journey to serve them at higher higher levels And that is how you play this game. Yeah, I want everybody to realize what you just got shown This right here what you just got shown and explained to you Somebody else would have charged you two thousand dollars and taken three days to explain All right, they would have called it affiliate marketing lala palooza and you're I mean it just Russell just laid out for you how to create a real business with Click funnels and funnel scripts, of course Without even having to have a website without having to have you can instantly have a million dollar business set up your results may vary And with no product of your own Think about that Actually one more thing I think is key. It's okay, but if it's larger quick, okay, it's just quick I we don't have the next meeting face. We're good for a few extra minutes. We're good. Okay All right, so this is what people do come over here You go over here and you gives mark Zuckerberg a dollar or two, right? And then it drives people into here and then if you walk in and it's good by here And the problem with traditional affiliate marketing is that a lot of times you you spend one dollar right here And after we come through and see this right here you drop out and you made like 75 cents, right? 75 cents right? Oh, this is my inner market to scam. I put it in dollar. I got 75 cents back out and broke up What happened you understand is that like the value in in any business is the customer, right? So the customer comes here gives you the email address This is now a customer and this customer starts going on this journey with you, right? So he's going along and and maybe he buy maybe like sweet through guys. Awesome Maybe like I need to bottom through that last week or maybe like well I don't believe in it or whatever the thing is right, but he still he's on your list So he's going down this journey until he gets this email. He's like, I'm not buying. I'm not buying. I'm not buying He comes over here and then like proof he's like, ah, I'm not into network marketing. I don't want that They's like work anifies like oh my gosh, you see drew six pack. I want six pack just like drew it can only he's got it I'm in and he goes he buys the stuff here, right? And the next customer comes soon He's like boom all three guys, but he gives you money here and the next person comes so everyone Kind of gives you my different points What happens is that somewhere between here and like the end of your customer journey Which is treat people right will be for forever. There's this magic spot It's called the break even point break even point where you spend a dollar here But you don't keep re spending dollars on these people here They're already on your list, right? And so maybe you'll make 75 cents by day one and then 80 cents by day three and by day by day five in your sequence You break even and what's cool is everything after day five is pure unadulterated All right, so I think Julie can you squeeze page and bridge page in 20 minutes? Okay, you're giving me the copy right Jim For a dollar And we're gonna send them we're sending them to this page. This is the this is the actual order page, right? Okay, so the first while you're setting that up so the first thing I'm gonna need to do is create actually a I'm gonna need to create a headline So I think what we're gonna do what I'm gonna be doing So I'm showing my screen and I'm just gonna be quiet a little bit while you're working on that Because usually Russell talks while I'm doing my magic over here, so I'm gonna let you do the same thing So I'm gonna actually gonna use the killer headline scripts version 2.1 All right, so I have actually only 18 minutes to build this so I'm gonna you want me to start talking All right, so I'm gonna create the squeeze page first this is gonna have the curiosity inducing headline that Russell talked about and Then we're gonna get their email address and then we're going to send them over to the bridge page so I'm just gonna look here at what the style is I mean really when it comes to squeeze pages you guys you don't really have to do anything other than what's already in click files Like if you're really fussy and you want to like change the background I can like get rid of the background here and I can make it like a prettier color or an uglier color depending on Unun on how I am like I can change the fonts But really like this is all you have to do now the the one thing I will say is that you just want to make sure That you're using you're connecting this to your email service provider or action edX or whatever you're using here So you can just go ahead and do that in settings and integrations and just you know select where you want to go So that's it you have a headline Jim Actually don't have one headline for you, Julie I have over 125 headlines and I'm just trying to you know sort through them a little bit So all right, so Jake just sent me a cool background banner So let me let me let me put that background on so I can show you how to do that real fast How about how to how to melt body fat in as little as 21 days? Even if you've tried every other diet in the world before and failed one of the things I want to tell you guys here is like if you've got a headline like this Let's it helps if you take it and you make them two different sizes So you you create the main headline and then you create like the sub headline And you make it like that, but I'm gonna actually move this this background because it's going right over her face There we go So I just changed the the setting on that background picture And now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make this headline really big well not that big Make it on two lines and then pick your font Doesn't really matter just something really bold really obvious and then Make your tagline Yeah, I think that works As a tagline, right? Even if you tried every other diet in the world before and failed. Yeah, absolutely All right, what about a call to action on the button? Well, you know, it's funny I'm just going through the call to action script here at Funnel scripts and I'm just one or two little variables away from Coming up and I'm gonna underline that So that people understand and then we'll do a call to action and we'll save this. Okay. There you go That's a squeeze page. I mean that's like literally all you have to do. I'm gonna probably bold that Okay, look at you. Look at you All right I'm just gonna clone this funnel step so that I can save my work and just keep the branding the same and I'm adding it to The funnel so now I have a second page here. And so now this is gonna be my bridge page. Okay, so we're gonna do a video and Are we gonna use the same we're gonna use the same headline, right? You know, I think we should use a different headline. Okay. What do you think Russell should it be a different headline? We do have a 50 of them so we might as well test. I mean, I was I was thinking more like, you know Top weight loss expert reveals how to melt body fat In in the next 21 days. Yeah, go ahead taste that for me. That's awesome Well, no top one. I want you to spell it out now top weight loss expert reveals how to melt body fat In the next 21 days what I'm thinking is that probably this is gonna be a testimonial so I'm Headline would be something like, you know Along the lines of here's my story Here's here's one person's or something. Here's one one person's weight loss story. I like that All right, so Russell's talking about the Brunson box. This is a Brunson box It's a spoiler box that basically kind of teases what's in the video because some people don't like to watch a whole video Or they're like, I don't know if it's worth my time And so when they see these like little teaser things about what's covered in the video then they're more likely to stick through and watch the Video, let's create a simple step one step two. So what I like to do is grab a headline like this Jim, what do you want to put under the step one and step two and step three? What kind of copy do you want there? Step one is basically go buy go go get your go claim your copy of three week diet Step two is send me your receipt and step three I'll send you all these cool bonuses what I would have under step one would be a big fat button that That took them to the through your affiliate link to the three week diet page But make sure it pops in a new window so that they don't they don't leave this page and then we'll add a button claim your three week Diet now, okay here here All right, then what you're gonna do guys is you're gonna duplicate this whole thing You don't have to do all that work step two is Email us your receipt, right? Mm-hmm, and then step three is gonna be something simple like we'll send you We'll send you all your cool bonuses including and then you would list them all off Well, let's and let's talk real quick about what you would do to make that video and and then we'll give you amazing kudos and stuff but what I personally would do is I would use the the million dollar testimonial script inside of funnel scripts and you can basically Use that to interview yourself or you could have some money interview You basically want to tell your story about the results that you've got and then I would end the video by telling them all the stuff that you That you would give them as a bonus in order for them to buy it because you believe in it so much You want to make sure that that everybody takes advantage of it. So you want to sweeten the pot? That kind of way, I mean that that would be a way That you could create an amazing video that would that would have a real impact on people I want you guys to really think about something there now, okay? using these tools using What she knows how to do it, you know just at a basic level under pressure and it's they always say that You always revert whenever you're under pressure can revert to your training Knowing how to use click funnels knowing how to use funnel scripts and having to get something done The stress that she was under is no different than you're working a full-time job You're trying to figure out how to create some income It's one o'clock in the morning and you're trying to get something done to feel like you're moving forward that same level of stress Is exactly what she was experiencing right there and we use the tools to create something actually looks pretty darn good In that 20 minutes and I think that is amazing and Julie deserves a big round of applause I think I think it's funny though because people always Like I talked to people all time who were like I've been in quick funnels now for a couple months I'm hoping you start done similar like a couple months like what are you doing? That is the number one thing that stops people is like the fear of failure and perfectionism It's in the only way to get out of that and get over it is to go right through it and think about what we did though As far as before we got into using click funnels or using funnel scopes We drew out on a piece of paper in effect or on the whiteboard what we needed to get done So it wasn't a situation of hey, let me get in here and I'll figure it out It's like I drew out exactly what I need and that's all there was that was it you're done You have that video done you could start promoting this thing so All right, we're gonna wrap it for today. Thanks everybody. Thanks Jim. Thanks Julie. Thanks. Everyone's back here filming as well We got Nick and Corbin and David and Melanie was fighting the spider Jake for doing the images and finding this thing. We appreciate everybody. We love you all and we'll see you at Funnel Hacking Live. Bye everybody
