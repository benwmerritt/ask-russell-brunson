Hey, what's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson and today I'm going to show you guys behind the scenes of one of my highest grossing sales phones of all time. If you are running live events or you'd like to run live events, this is going to show you step by step every single page, the ads, the copy, everything we're using to sell between 3 and 5,000 of you per month into our live virtual event. This funnel has completely transformed and changed our business. I'm going to show you guys the hooks, the ads, the funnels, the upsells, the downsides, the cross, everything you can see. At the end of this video, I'm going to give you guys a swipe file with all the different pages and funnels so you can model them inside of your business. This is based on a very simple funnel that anyone can do, including you. Let me walk you guys through the selling online funnel. Before we dive into the actual funnel pages, as you can see up above, I want to show you some of the ads that we are using. As you always know, in any business, the big secret is hook story offer. What's the hook you're throwing out in your audience to grab their attention? What's the story you tell them and what's the offer you're making? For us, because this is an event we're running every single month, we have to come back and we're doing lots of different hooks, lots of videos, lots of different things to get people's attention. You can see some of them right here. The one that we led with initially is very tied based on the sales videos. When you go to the actual sales letter, I'll show you guys that here in a second. You'll see the VSL that we have there. It's all based on me setting world record, doing one to many sales. From there, we tell that story. One of the core ads we launch with is actually showing the footage of me setting world record. It's me speaking at Grant Cardone's event, 1.5 hours setting world record. Let me show you guys a real quick glimpse of this app. Let me just tell you what I love about Russell Brunson. This is a family dude. You can see him hanging out with his family. Russell is successful. Russell is trying real things every day. He's willing to be transparent and say, hey, this is what I'm doing. I want to bring out Russell Brunson. Come here, man. He did $3 million in 1.5 hours. Okay, so you see I'm using footage and things like that to create ads to tell the story, which is the same story that they're going to see when they hit the landing page. So that's what we first initially launched. Then after that, it's like, okay, we need to start bringing in more different things, different pattern interrupts, right? Hooks are always about breaking people's patterns, right? I think about people that are on their phone, they're scrolling, look at it, Instagram or Facebook, whatever. I've got to be the hook that grabs their attention. And so with that is we have to create a lot of different ads, a lot of different creative. Okay, because especially when we're running an event month after month after month after month, things will get stale. People see the same ad. What happens is that something that is the pattern interrupt eventually becomes the pattern, right? And then your job as a marketer is like, what's the next pattern interrupt? What's the next pattern interrupt? So I worked with Christine Morel to make a whole bunch of really funny ads. We just came to her office and she broke in to find out the secrets from Russell Brunson. So I'll show you guys a quick glimpse of just part of the ad right here because I thought it was kind of hilarious. Today, I'm going to break into Russell Brunson's headquarters because I'm going to steal his secrets to selling millions online. And then I'm going to share them with you. I am going to give that the only man who can show us how. Russell Brunson. All of good marketing comes with lots of hooks and ads and different things you're throwing out there to grab people's attention. Okay, so after the hook's been set, the video plays, your story, the offers, then the click, it actually comes to the landing page. And I'm going to walk you through what that funnel actually looks like. Do you have a funnel but it's not converting? The problem 99.9% of the time is that your funnel is great, but you suck at selling. If you want to learn how to sell so your funnel will actually convert, then you need to get a ticket to my next three days selling online event by going to sellingonline.com slash YouTube or by clicking on the link in the description down below right now. Okay, so here is the back end of the new click funnel. So if you haven't seen yet, this is kind of what it looks like. You can see step by step here, the funnel. So here's the very first page. This is the homepage. People come when they hit it. And I'll show you that page in a second. After they sign up, they can go buy their tickets right here. Then they're taken to our VIP upgrade page, right? So we upgrade them to VIP as you'll see on the page where I show you there's two different options. If they say yes or no. All right, now if they say yes to the offer, then we have a confirmation page saying congratulations. If they say no, we also take the confirmation page. The only difference is on this version of confirmation page, we actually resell the VIP option. So there's one more last shot to kind of try to get them to sign up. But that's the core of what this funnel looks like. So let me walk you through page by page by page. So you see what we did, why we did it, so you can model it inside of your business. All right, page number one. Okay, this page is very simple. It leads with a big promise. If somebody comes to your three-day event, what is the thing that they are going to learn? Now we're split testing a lot of different versions of this headline. This is, I think right now, the current control. It says discover the one and many selling secrets that allowed me to sell over a million dollars online. Yes, that's billion with the B without a sales team. And it says, no, you will not sell a billion dollars with what I'm going to teach you. Just like if you were to pay Michael Jordan to teach you basketball, you wouldn't instantly become the goat. But you think you become exponentially better from where you are today. And then that's kind of the initial hook, right? So when someone comes to you, they know like, man, if I am going to come and sign up for a three-day event, I'm going to learn how to do one and many sales. Like that's the goal, right? The headline is to give them like, here's what you're going to learn. Okay. Also, I have the fact that it's a challenge. I have the dates, the times when the whole thing is happening. Okay. The down below. Now what I have is I have the video, the video sales letter, the VSL to actually sell this. And so again, the video is two minutes, 14 seconds. I'm not going to show you the whole thing. In fact, you should go to selling online.com and go watch it. But I just want to get you guys, I'm going to watch a second of this so you can see kind of a gist of what we're trying to do inside. What we're trying to capture inside the video sales letter. The next man we're about to bring up is the single greatest marketer of the 21st century. The goat of the marketing industry. New York Times bestselling author collects books. His ideas have literally shaped, crafted and molded how we view modern day marketing. But also everything he does is with integrity. The one, the only. And make some noise for Mr. Russell. Bronson! Okay. I wish I could start the whole thing. I love this video, but notice I'm building credibility. I'm trying to show that I'm the expert. I'm the person who understands this best in the world. And then from there, then I go and make the pitch saying, look, if you want to learn how to sell, cut an event for three days selling online. And then immediately down below, we have the ticket price, $100. This one, the challenge starts, they click the button and they can buy it. Right. So again, if you look at how we structure any page, it's always emotion, logic, fear. So everything above the fold is very emotional, right? Headline is emotional. Video is emotional. The offer is emotional. Okay. And again, the majority of your buyers will buy from here. We use heat mapping software at every page. So we'll see how he will scroll past here. Most people get to hear it and boom, they buy it. Okay. So you're emotional buyers and majority of people. Then you transition, you got logical buyers, like, what's the event about? What's going to happen? What's the schedule? Like they want to know all the details before they're willing to buy. So after the call to action and come down, okay, speak to logical buyers. Here's some testimonials. Logically, they can help you. Here's the sales letter. Here's what you're going to learn. Here's what's happening day one. Here's happy every single day. There's the structure of all the different days, right? And then he coming down. And then now we have sales letter, which gives a longer form thing, just kind of logically explain to them why they should go to this event, why it's important, what they're going to learn, all that kind of stuff. And we have long form sales letter. Okay. Now, if you're going to simplify this funnel at all, like the way you do is the above the fold is the most important. The majority of your sales, 70% of your sales come from above the fold. The other 30% come from the rest of this. And so these things are good, but a lot of times people don't launch a funnel because they're trying to write all the long form copy or they don't have testimonials yet those things take some time. So if you're going to cut anything, cut the bottom, you know, this bottom part and lead with the emotion above the fold, that's the most important. But it can give you an extra 30% bump by adding in the logic and the fear, the other parts here inside of the rest of the funnel. Okay. So there's the first page there. And then all the order buttons driving down to the sales letter or to the order form right here. And then the order form, boom, we've got two order form bumps. We've got a $47 course called the show up secrets for 47 bucks. This one converts like almost 60%. So if you can find something that's very congruent with the thing you're selling as an order form bump, you can get a huge take rate. Again, I teach people how to do one to many presentations. This bump is going to show you how to get more people to actually show up, right? Huge key. And then number two is we added in the vent notes and workbook for 27 bucks. And this one has a huge take rate as well. Right. So we added in those two upsells, those two order form bumps to increase our cart value. The reason why is because we're selling a three day event for just $100, which is pretty inexpensive, right? For me to sell one of these tickets through ads, it usually costs about $200 or more to sell that, right? So I have to be adding other things into the signup flow to make more money back. So it'll cover my ad spend. Cause I actually don't make any money. In fact, I lose money by doing the event. All the money is made during the event. And I'll talk to you through that here in a minute. Okay. So that's kind of the core information about what's happening on page number one. All right. Right now, any of you have had so far, drop in the comments down below. I want to see those. If you want me to keep sharing all these ideas, you got to give some feedback to me. So let me know what your biggest, how it was so far as to keep going through any, how you have dropped in the comments, dropping the comments. I want to see those things coming. All right. That's page number one, the funnel. Now we're going to transition over here to page number two. This is the VIP upsell. So someone just bought the $100 ticket. Now we're going to give them the opportunity to upgrade and become a VIP. Okay. And so here, here's what says basically how would you like to upgrade for a live VIP day after the event to get direct help with yourselves funnel. And then this is basically a live Q and A VIP day. Okay. And so I have a video here of me kind of explaining what it looks like. You come down and then there's two options. Number one is you can be a fly on the wall. We can sit in and listen for an entire day. Day number four, basically the vet listening to me doing Q and A with the members so you can learn a whole bunch. Or if you want, and this one's sold out right now, but you can pay 500 bucks and you can actually get your question answered. I mean, you show up, you ask me a question, I'll give you the answer. Okay. Now we're split testing a couple of things right now. Right now we offer the video replays when you buy this. We may take that out. I haven't decided yet. But my goal, if I did, if I did get rid of the video replays is to get more people to show up for the live event, which is the most important part. A lot of people take this because they want the replays. So my gut says the conversions will drop a little bit here, but we'll get more people to actually show up for the live event. So that's kind of a thing we're playing right now and that we are testing. All right. So those are two options right there. If they're not going to buy, there's a no thanks link. And again, the no thanks link, we always give a negative qualifier. So I'm saying yes or no thanks. Take me to the members area because that's a positive thing. I'm saying no thanks, not interested in upgrading VIP now, nor getting the song on the line to replace for free. Right. So it's negative. Like, I don't want this. I don't want this. So you kind of, I'm almost recapping the offer in the no thanks. Like you're not getting the VIP or the replays. Yeah. So that's coming to the negative qualifier. Okay. So there's all the motion that I'm going to transition to logic testimonials telling more of a story. Here's the logical arguments for those who are needing more reasoning behind it. Right. So leave the motion, then logic and then fear. Fear is your urgency and your scarcity. Okay. So speaking to logic testimonials, what they're going to get, what it looks like, telling the story, boom, there's called action again, and then more testimonials. Okay. So that is page number two in the fund right there, the VIP episode page. And then from there, we take them to the confirmation page. Right. And depending which one, if they said yes or no depends, the page looks almost identical. The only difference is if they didn't buy the VIP upgrade offer, we'll have the offer page again one more time. Okay. So tell them congratulations. And then a couple of cool things we do here. Right. Number one is that we actually push them to school because they have a community there and in school is where we communicate with people during the live event. So we push them to go get inside the community. Okay. Number two is we allow them to be an affiliate. Now what's cool about this is I told you right now it's cost us about $200 to sell a ticket to, to selling online event through Facebook ads. Right. And so instead of like, man, I would rather, you know, our customers sell the tickets and give them 100% ticket price. Right. So we do inside the new click, as you create instant affiliate links. So soon as some signs up, boom, they've been filling. They send that to a friend, posted on Facebook, Instagram, whatever. And some clicks there and buys, they get $100. They get a hundred percent of the sale of the ticket that person gets. Okay. And so what's cool about this is it starts making our events viral where people sign up and they invite their friends and they invite more people and they invite, you know, so like for every ticket we sell, we sell like an additional like a third of a ticket or something. Right. So if I sell 1000 people, I'm going to get 300 people who come from an affiliate, which is really cool. Okay. So this is the way to make your funnels more viral. Another thing we do to get people to promote this is in the fall up sequence after they join, we also push people to page like this, that basically sells us leave more. Right. Cause first time they see the link, they might not know. And so you get pushed this page says, Hey, do you want our $100 referral for the challenge? And there's a video me explaining how it all works. They put their email in and boom, it generates the instant affiliate link as well. So we have this, another like second pass, three emails to get them referring because again, the more people refer, it's just free people coming into my challenge or my event. I'm not paying marks. I'm a four, which is always great. And you can only do this in the great software at all time, which is called click funnels, getting an instant affiliate link for your customers. That way they can start promoting a rally gate. You can get a free 14 day trial right now by going to click funnels.com slash YouTube or click a link in the description down below and block out time on the calendar. Obviously, they see all the sessions that are coming up. They want to see what's happening. We don't give them too much details, but they are able to kind of see some of those things. My team has added that's kind of cool. All right. And so that's kind of the game plan. So that's everything that's happening in the funnel leading up to the actual event. If you know anything about funnels, the goal of every single funer is taking people down this process, down this path to help them in however you can, right? To help them, help serve them at the highest level. And so we get them on events number one. Now they come to the event. It's a three day event. And I'll come back down here. You can kind of see the schedule of what we do during the event. Okay. The structure wasn't something we just made up. If you go to, if you look at like funnel hacking live or any of my events, there's always the methods of madden. There's always a reason why we're structuring things this way. And so that's kind of, that's kind of what this is, is the structure to be able to increase the likelihood of people actually buying during the event. Okay. All right. So now again, day two, I make the special offer. What happens then from there we send people to the signup form. Okay. So here's the page looks like after somebody goes to the event and hear me pitch, they come to this page right here. And the first step that we do is there's video me kind of explaining what's going to be happening. So they have me kind of guiding them. And again, you'll notice with funnels, it's always about your guide. You're guiding somebody on a journey. Right. So they hit this page. There's a video me telling them exactly what to expect, what to do, what's going to happen. So they come over here and they start filling in the form. Right. And this is the basic form. Their contact information, email, phone number, what they're trying to do. So we get some basic information from them. So that's step number one. Okay. They go to that and they click submit and take some step number two and step number two, this page right here is basically says, thank you. Your application has been submitted. And then I basically here give them two different options. Okay. Option one, if you're ready to sign up right now and you know, click right here and we'll take you directly to the order form. You can sign up. You don't talk to anyone. You're ready to rock and roll and go. Okay. This is my goal. Obviously I want people like hopefully this point, you know, they've been in an event with me for two days. Hopefully this point they know if they're in or they're out. So they come right here and they sign up, which is really good. Nice thing about that. If anyone runs a sales team, um, no one has to talk to them on the phone. They're kind of signing up. So we make more money off these people's aren't pay sales commissions, but there's always people again, usually your logical buyers. They need more. They need to talk to them when they have a question. They whatever that thing might be. So for them, I have this option number two, which is this request to call back. So they click on this, boom, it then takes them to a page and actually it'll put them into queue. And then we have a whole team of people who call people immediately, find out their question and close their cell. Okay. So that's kind of what the two options look like. So I give them sign up right now or request a call back. And if they do go to sign up right now, it takes them to order form. And this is what the order form looks like right here. They come right there and they can sign up. And again, they can sign up for $10,000 one time or they can do three pay of $3997. Um, and then, um, we also ship them a shirt because that's cool. They picked the size they want. And that's what this page looks like here inside the funnel as well. Okay. And, uh, with testimonials, people have gone through it. So, but there you go. There's the order form and order form, uh, structure layout copies on the most important things. Like, um, we've tested a ton of order forms because people are like the last step, like they're there with their wallet, the rate of buy something for like, can you take my money? And then so many times the order form scares people off. So we found to make order form more simple is there's a headline, boom. There's the order form and there's a recap of what they're getting. And that's the extent of, we don't have. Long form sellers and things like that. Only other thing I add sometimes is sometimes I will in the replay sequence, I'll take the part of the offer where I make the picture. I'm just walking through everything they're getting when they sign up. I'll take that video. And I might embed it here on the page. It's like, Hey, if you, if you forgot what you were getting, click here and it'll recap is me doing the offer stack, walking through everything to get when they sign up for the offer. Um, I don't always do that, but if I am going to put any video or anything like that's all I'm putting on the, the order form, other than that, the order form should be very simple and very, very easy. All right. So that is behind the scenes of the selling online funnel. Again, this is one of my most profitable funnels to date and I've been playing this game now for over 20 years. And so there's so many little things that weaved into this funnel. I hope you got a lot of value out of ideas from it. If you did drop down to number one, I'll have to take away down below, but now that you're here, I want to give you guys the coolest thing. This is the best part of the videos as you guys know, um, as I actually went through and took screenshots of all these pages. I use a really cool tool that we created called Barnum PT, a basic thing about PT Barnum and chat GPT had a baby and it created a free Chrome plugin and the plugin is amazing because you can do screenshots. You can do funnel hacks. You can use AI to go rewrite pages. You can use the transfer funnels from click, most classic to the new click, most you can use it to move funnels from some of our competitors back into the new click funnels and a whole bunch of other cool things. But one of my favorite things is the fact that I can use it to take screenshots every single page in my favorite funnels. All I do is I click on the little hat right here. Boom, it pops up. I can say, I don't want to take a picture of the section. I grab it, take the screenshot and boom saves it into my Barnum PT account. But what's cool for you guys is because I love you already went through and screenshoted all these pages for you. They are right here inside my swipe file section. You can see I got swipe files for every funnel I've ever funnel hacked. There's tons of them in here. But right now I added these to our paid challenge funnels right here. And here's a selling online event. So down in the description below, I'm going to put a link. I'll use you to click on the link and it'll take this entire funnel hack, all the screenshots to the pages and it'll copy them inside of your Barnum PT account. If you don't have a Barnum PT account, you can get it for free just by clicking the link down below as well. It'll be in the descriptions. Just click on the link to get your free copy of the swipe file of the selling online funnel and we'll import this that way as you are building your next funnel. You can look at it as a model, get ideas, product structure of pages, copy issues, etc. etc. And that is my gift to you guys for listening to this video. I hope that you enjoyed it. And with that said, you guys, I hope you're enjoying these funnel hacks. It's been fun going behind the scenes and doing deep dive showing you guys the things that are working inside the funnels. If you want to watch another funnel hack, there's going to be a link right over here or here or somewhere where you can watch another one of our funnel hacks. Thanks so much. We'll see you guys on the next video.
