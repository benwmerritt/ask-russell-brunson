Alright, for everyone just tuning in, my name is Russell Brunson and right now I'm going to be covering another really cool question about how to grow your company, how to do funnels and today's question is called funnel profits. Russell, what can I do to attend X my sales funnels profit? Okay, so I'm going to begin by doodling out a sales funnel. Obviously, every sales funnel is different. Ever since we launched the company ClickFunnels, people have been able to create all sorts of sales funnels. So you can do simple ones, complex ones, there's a bunch of variations but most sales funnels aren't that complicated, right? Unless you are using really confusing software then some people get really confusing but I like to keep it simple. So most of my are going to be like a landing page where my goal is to get somebody's email address, right? So it's going to be an email form and a button. Then from there I go to a sales page where maybe there's a video and then there's a button where somebody gives me money and then the next page, maybe there's a page where there's another video here and then there's an upsell, they click a button and there's an upsell. So like that's a basic funnel, right? And so the coolest thing about what we do as funnel builders inside of ClickFunnels is if you've read the .com secrets book or you're getting any of my books, I go deep into how these things work, right? Like step one, step two and that whole bunch of different funnel types. But what people understand is that the reason why this is so magical and the reason why I'm making really simple funnels is because I can test something, right? So let's say I create the funnel the best I can, I don't know if it's going to work or not. Then I go over and I talk to Mr. Zuckerberg over at Facebook and I say I'm going to buy some ads, right? So I go and I buy some ads and I drive traffic into this. Now what's cool about this is I can go and I can buy some ads and some people, depending on your budget, might be like $10 or $50 or $100 or $1,000 or something. But I usually put some money in and I sit back and I just wait. And I watch it and what's going to happen is the ads, the market is going to show me exactly what's working and what's not working, okay? So what happened is like, let's say I spend $1,000, right? So I spend $1,000, let's say I, it cost me a dollar per click just to make the numbers easier, right? A thousand people end up showing up on this landing page. So then look at Kate, of the thousand people that ended up on the landing page, how many people gave me their email address? And I look at that number and say, okay, looks like we had 378 people gave me their email address, okay? So the conversion of step one and step two is with 378. Then I'll say, okay, from 378 people gave me the email address, how many actually purchased? I'll say, okay, well, we ended up having, say, 10 people that actually purchased and said, okay, how many people took the upsell? From the upsell, we say, okay, we had one person take the upsell, right? So now I look at this number and I say, okay, what is it like, a thousand people came and I got $1,000. So that means the ad, it means I'm spending about a dollar per click, which is actually really, really good, right? So I know that the ad over here, so this is Facebook, I'm placing the ad, okay? I know that that worked, that was good. So I'm not going to touch the ad because the ad's perfect. They come over here, a thousand people hit, 378, so it means a 37% opt-in rate, which is pretty good. That's not horrible, it's not the best, but it's pretty good, okay? So that means, if I draw a little number here, it means 37.8% of the people opted in on this page. So this page is a winner, winner, chicken dinner. I'm not going to touch it, I'm going to be pretty excited about, right? So now 378 came to this page and 10 bought. So what's the math on that for all of our mathematicians at home? Let's see, it means what, 3.7%? I believe, am I right on that? Anyone want to check my math? Bought off this thing here and when I 10 means 10% bought here, right? So I'm looking at all this thing, so 37%, 3.7%, 10%. So if I'm looking at this funnel and I'm coaching somebody, I'm going to say, okay, what's broken? The ads are doing awesome, a buck per click winner, that's awesome. Number two, 37% opt-in rate, that's cool, we're not going to worry about this. 3% sales rate, that's depending on the price point here, that's not too bad. And then 10% like that's, maybe that's really, really low, right? And again, I could shift these numbers, let's say I shift these numbers and I go from 378 to, let's say we only get 78 people to opt-in, right? And then all of a sudden these numbers start shifting, so now it's like, oh crap. On this funnel we only had 7.8% opt-in rate. Now I'm looking at that, there's your issue, that's the problem, that's horrible opt-in rate, okay? So what do we know? It means I didn't use enough curiosity on the landing page, it means my landing page was too flashy, it was confusing people, whatever it is. So I got to change that, right? So I come in there and we call these funnel audibles, I come in there, I call them audibles, I need to tweak this page a little bit, we make some tweaks and changes and hopefully this goes from 17% to 17% and we keep tweaking it. Now it's 27%. Now it's 37%, right? We make the changes and then eventually this goes back to green where we're like, sweet, that number's awesome, I'm really happy at 37% that I opted in and now, you know, I put a dollar into ads and now maybe back here, $2 pop back out. Which that's all marketing is, right? It's all funnels ours. How do I build a funnel where I can put a dollar in advertising in and get $2 back out? Okay, if you get a slot machine, you put a dollar in and every time popped out $2, how many times did you put a dollar in? You put in a dollar every single day as often as fast as you could, right? So same things, we're building this little slot machine where you put a dollar in and get $2 back out, that's all we're playing with this game, right? It's super fun. And so I'm looking at it as like, okay, I put the dollar in, I get $2 back out, if not, which one of these numbers is skewed? And then I figure out, okay, opt-in's rate's awesome but this is only converting it at 0.5%? That's the red one. This is the one that's good, something's not right here. Either my video's not right or the offer's not right or something's not right, so I'm going to tweak some stuff, change some things, spend a little bit more money and see what happens. And that makes me tweak some changes, spend some more money and we can go into that process until it works. And I have a funnel where I can put a dollar in advertising in and get $2 back out. So that's how we 10X ourselves from those profits. If you look at anybody in my inner circle, people I coach directly, my own funnels, this is the game we play. We create our best version we possibly can, we go spend some money on ads and then we sit back and watch and see what happens. They come back and say, oh, our guess on this page was wrong or this was awesome, that's awesome, this is doing bad or these are doing awesome, our ad costs are paying like $22 per click. Maybe our ad's horrible, let's change the ad around. And you just make a couple of adjustments and tweaks until it works and see if it works. You got something to put a dollar in and get $2 back out, then you just dump as many dollars as you can. And every once in a while, not all the time, but every once when you build a funnel that's so good where instead of putting a dollar in and getting $2 out, put a dollar in and you get $3 out or $5 out or $10 out and this is like the big pay days you're looking for, right? We don't know which one's this going to be, which is why it's so much fun building funnels inside of ClickFunnels. You try one, test it out, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. They try another one, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. You try another one, make some tweaks, make some changes until like boom, something hits and then it's off to the races. So that is how you 10X your sales profit is just by watching the numbers and doing basic, simple math, making simple adjustments, trying again and keep doing that until you have something that actually works.
