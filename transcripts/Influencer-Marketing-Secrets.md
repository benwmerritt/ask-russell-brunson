Our special guest is Nicole Arbor. And she's actually here in Boise today at ClickFunnels headquarters. We are making a funnel with her. That was he just did the thing he does. And then I was like, can we pull you aside and interview for like 30 minutes or an hour? I don't know how long we're going to go about. It got to the point where I was going to commit suicide because I got the disability certificate for life. It scares you. I know, but I can kind of touch on that right now. If it doesn't scare you, you're not doing it right. How would you, how would you deconstruct that? You're the boss in the boardroom, boss in the bedroom, be the boss of your health. Lady boss. Welcome to the marketing secret show with your host, Russell Brunson. First off, thank you for hanging out. Are you kidding? Thank you for having me. I have everybody on my team knows I've been so excited to work with ClickFunnels. I'm like, I'm at the mecca of the people who know how to do this. Yeah, you're freaking awesome. This is great. Oh, so cool. So tell me about actually one time about your creating. Yeah. This is actually really exciting. I don't know if a lot of people know this side of your story because they see your video, see you going viral, but what 10 years ago you were disabled and struggling in pain and stuff like that. So tell what you're building. Back to 2014 is when I started getting up again. So I still get like culture shock. 2008 I was in a car accident that rocks my body. It was really difficult for me. I ended up in severe chronic pain, worst chronic pain. And then it got to the point where I couldn't walk on most days. I had TMJ so bad. I crushed my own teeth and my mouth while I was sleeping. And yeah, it was, it's something I just wouldn't even wish it on my worst enemy. I just wouldn't do it. And then I had the nerve pain so bad and nerve damage that I went through my hands and at this hand was a claw most days. Couldn't do 90% of normal activities and spent most of my 20s in bed and on disability. And then eventually we were just talking about this. I smile when I say it now because I know where I got to. But it's such a dark story. It got to the point where I was going to commit suicide because I got the disability certificate for life and that's hard. Like they say you have to try to get this for you. But once you get it, it's like, oh, you just won the worst contest ever. For real. It's not an award you want to win. No, I don't want that. And when I saw it, I was like, I can't live like this. The pain isn't changing. All the doctors appointments aren't helping. Nothing's helping me. And I was going to commit suicide because I thought it was the only way out. And as I have said this before, I heard the voice of God who sounded like Denzel Washington in my head and he was like, it's not time to give up. It's time to get up. It's like this weird, the Titan type thing. And I was like, okay. And took myself to the bookstore with a little bit of money I had. Bought a Louise Haybook. I'd never even heard of her, but I was just like, this is what I'm supposed to get. And started the journey to healing myself from the inside out and switching to natural remedies and remedies that were not mainstream at all fired my doctors. As I like to say, like, you guys don't know what you're doing for me. It's not working. Bye. And really had to rebuild my entire life, my business, my mindset and my body from scratch. And I think it was 2014. I sometimes skew this number, but in March of 2014, I took myself off disability. I was like, stop sending this because if you send it, it's a crutch. If I have nothing, then I'm going to have to swim. And by September of that year, I was the most viral comedian in history. So I made myself do it. Yep. So between March to September, I was like, let's go. It's funny because in our community, I talk to people all the time about how like I feel entrepreneurship is calling. And it's like, there's something they, they, I think each of us has our own certain, they set a circumstances, things that happen to us, positive, negative, whatever to, to give us the tools to like serve somebody else. And they, it's interesting because you went through this horrible period of your life where you were in pain, everything, but then you look at it now, it's like, now you have the ability now to help other people who are going through that. And so, and you're going to help me do it. I'm going to help you do it. And you're going to sell a billion copies of your course and you're going to be the first person to get three comic club award. Yeah. That's the plan. So that is the plan. Well, yeah, that's the course. So, so cool. I was going to do these other courses, which I shot them to, but I went, what am I an expert at? I again, heard that voice of God and it's getting through chronic pain and people are not going to teach people this method because people have not lived through it. So a doctor telling you to do something is based on a book they read or something they watched. I've lived it. I've experienced all of these different kinds of treatments and I condense everything I learned in all those years into seven weeks. And we're going to help market that to everybody. And what's cool is that you've built this huge platform and, and I think most people follow you for different reasons, right? There's comedy, there's funny things. There's like smart theater, so many things you're doing, but also then you have this huge platform. Now you're like, this is what I want to focus on. You're going to help so many people with that. And then it's exciting. It is exciting. It feels like it's my, this is my Mr. Holland's opus. Yeah. I've never actually seen that movie. I need to watch it. Oh, it's so inspiring. Everyone says it's so good and I've always wanted to watch it, but then every time I'm like going to watch a movie, I'm like, Avengers, which is hard to, you know. You mean Avengers again, right? Yeah, come on. It's still good every time. It is every time. We're getting to end game. I feel like in America and in the world, it's almost Avengers end game time in real life. We know how it ends. Iron Man reverses time. So anyway. All right. I'm back to you on mask. He's got this. Yeah. You on where are you? Yeah. You know where he is. Reverse time. Yeah. Okay. So, so I want to talk about as you were coming out of that, right? And you said that was, you said March or May? That was like March and then by September. September. So in that window of time, what was like, what was going through your head? We're like, I'm going to go and become a viral comedian. I'm going to do these things or like, was it strategic? Was it just something happened? It was magic or what? There was no magic. Every single thing was bad. Everything is plotted. Yeah, it was because I had been doing marketing for years. I stumbled into it by accident. I've told this story before. I was hired by Molson. Do you know what Molson is? Molson Canadian. So it's like the top beer in Canada. It's a Coors, Molson and Corona are all the same company. And they hired me to do this cross Canada tour. I'm the host being funny. I was on like the top TV show in Canada on our version of MTV at the time. And they wanted me to do all these commercials. And then I do this tour right across the country with huge bands, surprise band every night type of thing. When they gave me script for these commercials, I was just like, no. And I didn't know at the time I wasn't supposed to say anything in these marketing meetings when I'm just the talent sitting there. So it was like, all these marketing dudes and the CEO of Molson. And they were just like, OK, and then she's going to say this. And I was just like, oh, and the CEO looked at me. He goes, what? And I'm like, no, you guys are using slang that college kids used three years ago. This is so bad. Nobody's going to say you weren't funny or the writer wasn't funny. They're going to say, I'm not funny. And I don't like it. And I'm funny. I don't want to do this. And the CEO is like, well, what would you do? And I'm like, well, actually, and I told him and then they bought it from me. And then they bought the next thing for me. And then Virgin Mobile called me and I helped with the launch of Virgin Mobile in Canada and it just went from person to person to person. Hey, call the call. She knows what to do. I had a viral video. I think it was. Oh, man, it was probably 2008. Was the first viral video I had. And that was with Virgin Mobile. And we did a Christmas. This is before the accident. This is before the accident. No, that was right after the accident. So I was like hiding that I couldn't do stuff. It was it got worse and worse and worse. So by 2008, I was still like, OK, like hiding some pain. And I got worse. But I want to point out something you say, because I don't know if you knew you said it or not, but from a marketing standpoint, I think what you're so good at and you can watch this if you follow you socially is you're so good at like getting in the mind of where people like the conversation happened to people's mind right at that moment. You know what I mean? Which is what you did with those ads, but you watch yourself socially. Like you always and we're going to talk about controversies. That's the whole point is like controversy marketing. Yeah, find these controversial topics. Yeah. They're like, huh. And then you say things like, like most of us are thinking that, but no one will say those things. Like you're so good at like finding that you just like you're you're so I don't know, like in tune or the feel the pulse of like the market and the world. And like, I'm going to talk about that thing that no one wants to talk about. We're all thinking it. Yeah. And like just bringing it out, which I think is what it gets fascinating because it's not so much the going viral or these things is like, I got to be super not the creative. It's like you had to understand maybe I'm wrong, but like what people are actually thinking and being willing to actually say it. Yeah, I realized because I was disabled. And I was like, I actually have a giant opportunity here right now. I don't have an employer. Nobody can fire me. I already have a ton of medical debt. So it's not like I'm going to lose money. I'm already at the end. Like whatever. I have no credit. I got nothing. So I made a list of all the truths that I wanted to tell that I think people are too scared to talk about. And I was like, if I was going to die tomorrow, this is what I want to talk about with the world. And I went through that list and then I thought of topics that people are too scared to talk about. And some of them I put online and like, do you guys want me to say this or talk about this one or this one next? And I just set it up like I always do. It's a baseball lineup. So as you know, with your baseball lineup, you're not putting your best hitter first. That doesn't make sense. Like load the bases, get all the points. So I put the first video out. Dear Instagram models. It was about Instagram models because we were all thinking at the time that video went viral. What was it called? Um, dear Instagram models. Yeah. I started writing my letters to the world. That's literally what it was. Letters to the world. Wrote that I did the editing technique that I had done on the TV show I was on way years earlier. There's some speculation that I fine-tuned or invented the jump cut. I don't know if I don't want to take the full credit, but nobody had done it like that before. Take the credit. I'll take the credit. Sure. If someone wants to challenge me on it. As you mentioned the jump cut. I was the inventor of the comedic jump cut. Um, yeah. So everyone was doing their videos in a certain way. I was like, no, I'm going to do it like this. I'm going to tighten it up. I'm going to use sound bites because I had been studying NLP to help me with all of my pain. So I was like, I'm using NLP. I'm going to repeat the messages that I want them to think of again later on in the video and I'm going to hit them again with what I hit them with at the beginning. So they leave with what I want them to leave with. That's what you're going to discuss with this video. And I started with the Instagram model one. I did a relationships one, one other, which I considered a bunt. I only wanted that one to get a million views. I was like, just one more, just to show this, not this isn't a, whoops, she did it again. And then I posted a little photo of pointing to the outfield, Babe Ruth. And the next video came out was dear fat people. Dear fat people. So people are already really mad at this video. What are you going to do for that people? Knocked them all around. Was that the one that was it September that one came out? Yeah. Okay. End of, might have been end of August or early September. Yeah. And then the one right after that one viral too. And next and the next and next. And I just kept going through the batting order. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy. So that was the first, my first introduction was your fat people video. It came and we're here now. So you thought it's funny. I, I don't, yeah, it was amazing. But it was funny because like, I don't remember what happened. It's when things go viral, people start sending to you. Like people, that's what happens, right? Well, since I don't remember what happened, but somehow like, multiple people sent to me one day and I'm like, what is this? And I watched it. I was like, oh, wow. What did they say when they sent it? Do you remember? It's usually not much like, hey, check this out. Oh my gosh, you'll see this. Like if you've seen the call, I would like watch this video real quick. That's funny. It's like dear fat people. Like, Oh no. You know what I mean? And you watch it and it's interesting because, um, yeah, like you're in the conversation, there's things that are true. There's things that are scary. There's things are controversial. Like all those things aren't all happening, which I think is what causes this and there's people, people that are really angry. I was reading the comments and people who just think you're the worst person in the world and people who are loving you like finally someone said it and which causes the engagement and like all these things. But, um, I didn't know what to ask you other than just like, what were you feeling during that time? Like, were you scared? Were you excited? Were you nervous? Like, I can't imagine. It was so weird because I was on my way to do a show at the Royal Palace in England and I was booked for that show based on the three videos prior and do you have people just came out? So I'm in England by myself, um, about to do this huge show literally at the Royal Palace and this video is going bananas and it's going bananas. I remember opening a newspaper in the UK and I was in it and I'm like, Oh, that's weird. And then you're hiding in the newspaper. Yeah. Okay. And then a friend called me. They're like, Hey, you're on access to Hollywood. Hey, you're on entertainment tonight. Hey, you're on this. Hey, the view is talking about you. Hey, this, this, this. And I'm like, Oh, I'm good at what I do. Yeah. I thought that, but I'm like, ha, it worked. I knew exactly what I was going to do. Now they're talking about the topic and the actual problem, which is a real problem in America still is. And it worked. Yes. And the only, the only thing that made me be like, yeah, oh my gosh, was when I had a couple of family members that were like, Oh no, some people are hating on you. I'm like, yeah, well, that's been since high school. Like that didn't actually affect me that much because I'm like a seasoned comedian of whatever you get heckled happens. Just a lot more of them. It's fun. I have the same thing when someone, when someone writes something that goes bad, negative about me, it's my family members of freak out. I'm like, I've got thick skin. I'm going to just like, I'm fine with it. Like if you read all the ads or the comments of my ads, like I'm finding that they're the ones always freak out. They're just like, Oh, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, they want to like, are you okay? I'm like, I'm fine. I was good. I'm like, you good? We're good. All right. A couple of things because I think some people thought that you doing that was because you were trying to be a bully or trying to be mean, which I know you and I know kind of story behind, but it's the opposite of that, right? It wasn't, and I love you to talk about that a little bit. Well, thanks. Um, so there was a line, I've talked about this a few times. There was a line at the end of that video that I cut out the last second. And this was a marketing technique. I said in that video, as someone who's been disabled for X number of years, all I wanted was a body that worked and you have one. And if you take it for granted, that's the biggest mistake you're ever going to make. And I took it out at the last second of the edit. I was like, it will not hit as hard if they're going to humanize me. I need to be the villain. And it was really fun. Cause it was the first time in my life I'd ever been the villain. I'd always been like the happy bubbly cheerleader gets along. Like, I don't, I don't think I ever had an enemy in my life until I had viral videos. And I was like, whoa, there's some power in being like, I don't care. I'm going to say the thing. And yeah, that's kind of what I did. Cause it, cause that would have changed it. Don't you agree? I couldn't have humanized. At the end. Yeah. Yep. Couldn't have done it. So I was looking at buying a brand. Uh, actually I had an abundance called Zuma Juice and it's a green drink. And the first video, the green drink, they launched it. It's this person that cutting green drink stuff at their house and like fruit ninja throwing fruit in her, she's cutting it. And that was like the person. And then they had this lady in a wheelchair with the big old thing of cheese puff. She's like, what's green drink? And she's eating these cheese puffs. It's like the funniest thing. And then her chair's like electricity drives over and they're fighting. And it's just a funny thing. Right. So they launched a video. It goes completely viral and like it hits and then the handicap community came out and freaked out, burned them to the ground. So he ended up pulling the video, editing that clip out, relaunching it and never it just died. No, the company kind of, you know, and eventually it went away and then I bought the company and I messaged you cause I was like, I want to relaunch with that video, but I'm scared. Like, okay, here's the thing. And that's anyway, I have great, great thoughts on that. So this was actually a part of dear fat people and why myself with my personal convictions, religious beliefs, whatever, I'm like, it is not bullying to tell the truth. That is a lie that we've been sold. Um, it is also not, not okay to poke fun at everybody as long as you poke fun at yourself, which I do all the time. I'm silly. That video to me, if it's a self-inflicted disability, which is what I consider obesity, uh, there's a couple of emotional things that go into it, but for the whole, most of the part it's a self-inflicted disability. You don't get to consider yourself the same as people with disabilities. So I don't think that people would come after you that way, like in that way, or you could just take that little part out of it, reshoot that scene, take the wheel chair out, but just still make it that aesthetic and have them do it. Yeah. It's interesting. It scares you. I know, but I can, can I touch on that right now? If it doesn't scare you, you're not doing it right. Um, every time I'm consulting for people, for brands, for whatever, I was like, if it doesn't scare you a little bit, then it's going to be shit. And it could be mediocre. Go ahead, put out more mediocre ads. That's just brand awareness. But if you want it to rock, it's got to scare you a little bit because it has to induce, you know, marketing when I want it has to give some kind of emotion to the audience. And whether that's like, I hate it. I love it. It made me sad. It made me want to help it, whatever it is. If there isn't that ting of, ah, then you didn't do it. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Do you ever want to see it? Do you ever, yeah, I'll search you. Okay. Do you ever fear though, like that by cut, by offending that segment that it's going to hurt things? Are you, I'd love to hear your mindset or is it like, I'm going to be a little aggressive, but then because of that, this side's going to amplify more. Are you know what I mean? So I haven't found that intelligent people are offended by me. I've yet to find that. Um, I have found that people who weren't going to like me anyways, or they like to project their own downfalls, laziness, insecurities, whatever it might be onto other people. Like I have my problems in there, just me who has them. Those aren't my people anyway. And I sometimes sit back and I look at the people I have attracted in my life. I've attracted to you. I've attracted like massive, amazing people. And I, you know, like a, a, a lane of cartel and like we're just talking about like the people around me, I'm like, yeah, I'm going the right way. It's okay to tell the truth. And if at any time I think I'm being mean or not telling the truth or it's not comedic, then I wouldn't do it. So yeah, that's my thoughts on that. The other fascinating thing you told me, I remember was you said that did your fat people video, the people that made the most money from that were all the, the weight watchers, like they were buying ads on your video because like it was bringing the right people for them. Right. Exactly. Cause they knew that they were watching that video. And it's funny cause I ended up doing, I made fun of fit tea cause if fit tea was popping around ish the same years and I did video making fun of fit tea and the CEO called me and he's like, you're right. Want to do an ad for us. I'm like, yeah, I do. So I actually did two, two rounds of ads for fit tea after that, but I told the truth about it and then if people want to buy it, that's up to them. But yeah, like nothing I've ever done comes from the angle of I want to hurt feelings to see if that'll enrage people. Like I don't do rage bait. I don't like it. I think it's kind of gross. There's a lot of Tik Tokers who do that. Like, look what horrible thing this person does where I'm offended and that's not my vibe. There has to be a meaning behind what we're doing. Yeah. Okay. So I want to talk about this. So, because again, the marketing standpoint, obviously we did there was cool, but then now you have people, brands you're working with and also your own projects you're working with. Yeah. I love that the mindset is you're going in and say, you're working with the brand or working with something. How do you come up with the scripts and the ideas and the angles to be able to, to craft that message? Like I have the way that I write my scripts. Mine are very different than yours. I'm fascinated by, by writers, how they come up with it. I'm curious for you about your processes. What's the goal? Who's our demo? Go backwards. And that's kind of it. Like what's the goal? Is it a monetary goal we have associated with this? Okay. I'm going to do the math. How many of these do we have to sell to get to that goal? Okay. How many people that would have that price point available right now? Could we get to buy? Who is that person? And what are they like? What do they hate? What do they aspire to be like? You know, and then I just like do that little wheel turn and then I go, okay, cool. And the problem solve is so under looked. It like, I love solving problems for people. Even the invented problems that we have, you know, like, Oh no, I can't blah, blah, blah. Okay. Well, this product is going to solve that problem for you or, you know, like the weight loss stuff. It's so easy. I want to lose weight, but I don't want to actually have to eat healthy and make meals. Here's a bar that's going to do it for you. There we just solved the problem. You just laughed at me. Yeah. So I just got you to laugh. You're going to remember the funny ad I based on that. All right. So here's, here's my, I'm getting free consulting because I got you on my phone. So click fun. I love this. How would you make something for click fun? What would that, what would you do? For click funnels 2.0. Yes. Hey, do you like money? I love money. Hey, let's make you more money. You have something that's awesome. Why wouldn't we amplify this to more people make it faster? You know how many people are lost on your website? Cause you make it too hard for them to buy the thing that they already want to get. Oh, that's kind of stupid. Let's make it easy. Stupid. Uh, you know, something in there, like, playing off what they're doing now and like, yeah. Or I love the, the visual of someone just like walking down the street, opening up their wallet, throwing money on the gun, walking in and throw money on the gun. It's like, Hey, you apparently don't like money. And he's like wasting it cause you're a website's garbage. You know, like just overplay all the things that people are doing. That's cool. Taking the thing and then like over drama dramatizing the, what they're actually doing. Yeah. Once you make people laugh and feel something, you grab them. It's fun. So that, that, yeah, that's a good one for click funnels. What are the main selling points for click funnels 2.0? The biggest parts are so click funnels. The original click funnels was about building funnels, which is what people need. It's not necessarily what they want. They want a website. They want a brand. They want a shopping cart. They want all this stuff. And so we always used to make fun of it. Like you don't need those things. You just need this, but when it all comes down to people, why would they want? And so it's like, yeah, click, you know, gizmo they want where you can build a website, you can build a store. So you can have your, your blog, your Shopify store, all that kind of stuff is now in click funnels and then. Oh, I got it. Okay. Imagine a grocery store or like we're shooting in a grocery store, but in this grocery store, you walk in and it only has apples and you're like, okay, I got an apple. And they're like, okay. And then you have to walk across the street to the banana store and buy a banana. Then you have to walk across there and get the, like, this is stupid, right? Yeah. Put it all together. Click funnels 2.0. Yeah. It's kind of easy, right? Yeah. It's just the idea of, yeah, put it all together and make it as easy as it is to change your social media profile. Even an idiot can use this. Click funnels 2.0. Lesser stupid. Designed by idiots for idiots. I'm just kidding. If you wanted to make one, so let's go like a step back further. Cause with like dear fat people in some of these videos, you're not necessarily selling off the thing you're creating. Like you talked about your, just send the grand slam to get people. Um, like when you work with brands, I know, I can't remember, you talked about this earlier, say like you did a video initially that was just. Presenting the problem. Great controversy. Yeah. And could problem. And then late, like next came the video. We talked about that whole thing as well. Yeah. So that one was with Happen app. I love it. And I've done this model multiple times. So with Happen app, the first video I put out was why dating is fucked. And that video, it was just funny. It talked about like our online habits, whatever it naturally got 45 million views just on Facebook, organically. Is that on your personal profile? Their profile profile. So didn't mention the brand at all in the first one because it's not a commercial. So just comedy and we're just talking shit. So once it hit to that 45 million mark and then more on the other platforms too, then I released a week later the how to fix it, which is Happen app. You're actually going to meet these people because when you walk by them, then you get it. Oh, that's who that person is. Like a little ding on your account and doing it that way by being like, this is dope. Hey, here's here's how we can solve this problem. They slaughtered. They did so well. They did so well. They stopped telling me how well they did. I have to negotiate my contact. So I was like, oh, that's how I know. Yeah. Can I ask how, and I don't need actual numbers, but just conceptually, like how do you as someone who's doing that? Cause you're doing the influencing, you're writing, scripting, you're doing video. Like how do you get paid in a situation like that? Just so people know if they wanted to go find somebody to work with. Like, what does that kind of look like? Yeah, it's changed now. So at first it used to be just like, here's just an upfront fee. Now I go, okay, upfront fee. This is for the ideation phase and the whatever if there's a production cost, depending on how the level of the production. And then if it's a product that's a newer product and I'm going to help push in the stratosphere, I obviously want some points on the product. Because let's be partners in this. Let's go all in. And then if it's that's not available, something like that. I'll never, oh my gosh, brands, please listen. Do not go to influencers and be like, let's do a, you got this percent and use this code. Chances of your back end breaking when I bring volume are really high. Most people say their systems can handle it. Most systems can not handle it. Your website might break. Your funnel might break. Your website can't handle traffic. It breaks. So all that traffic I just brought you, I'm not going to get paid for. So I won't do deals like that. And most influencers won't. So just don't pitch. And you're unique from most influencers because most influencers I know a lot of my big followings and they can do, you know, they do their thing, but like you're unique because you're able to write into script and strategize. I don't think most of them have a marketing mind. Do they? Or have you noticed that? No, they don't. Yeah. So most of them call me and I help them. Yeah, for real, but I'm happy to. And all the people who made fun of me for making YouTube videos years ago, they come to me now. You gotta make an agency just like teach or like, yeah, scripting out all the stuff for the other influencers. Cause I wish there was more of that that we could, maybe there is. I don't even know about the network of you going like, here's all the influencers you can tap into and like, and figure out those kinds of things, you know, where they write a script and write a thing. To me, that would be epic. That would be like an Avengers type of thing. So here's the different genres of influencers and here's how you could use them and utilize our audience. Yeah. Cause most of the stuff we've done is like, we got to know people who had a relationship to whatever and it's like one off things, you know, versus like, that'd be cool to have a place. Anyway, so there's your next billion dollar idea. So. Cool. Thanks. I liked it. Okay. I'm going to have you come up. Okay. So yeah, we'll be the far before. It'll be amazing. Click. Oh, you're going to make me, I'm going to dream about this tonight. I'm like, oh, click for those two point out what problems are all the problems itself? Who, what do we do? I'm going to have so many ideas for you. Yeah. It's going to be fun. So with your, um, I'm just curious about your overall strategy because you do the videos, but then it feels like the next phase was like you building your brand of your following and someone's mowing the lawn outside for those who were anyways, um, as you were building, what, how did that fit into it? Was that a part of it initially? It was kind of bananas because it worked too well, too fast. And, you know, but I was still disabled as they started going viral. So I was getting all of these bookings and I couldn't do them all because I was like, Oh, like when it came to the royal palace, I was like, shoot, I better get up. I have to go on a plane and go to England. I didn't tell them I wasn't walking most days. I was like, I'm going to take the prescriptions I need to be able to do that at the time, but it grew. And then I started doing a lot of the consulting and then more of the consulting. And then as it worked and I had more success, I would like have more and more brands. So like the last few years of my career has been 90, 85 to 90% consulting and working with brands and keynote speaking. And the Nicole, you know, storefront, like the real me has not done that much stuff and I'm about to flip that whole model over and focus on the course that we're doing together. Cause that really matters to me. My podcast, because I have cool stories to tell and it's going to be like a late night vibe to where I get to do my funny model logs off the top. And then that's going to be cool. I'm really excited. And then only partnering on projects. I love like we were just talking about like, I feature film aspirations and I don't want to just go be in somebody else's movie because that takes three to six months of my life. I'll do a couple of cool ones, but I want to be writing those and helping direct them and the music stuff has been helping with that too. Yeah. Talk about that. Cause that's something you launched a music career. Yeah. It was just amazing when you build, when you build your personal brand the way you can, then it opens up so many doors. Like I want to be a musician and a rapper and write books and I want to do a podcast and like opens up so many cool things. But what brought you to wanting to go and I know music kind of your back down initially with dancing and stuff. Yeah. Like I was one of those hardcore choir kids and I took music and through school and all my certificates and all that kind of stuff too. And I always was just like, I want to do this. And I've written stuff for other people. NDAs prevent me from saying where they went, but I have done like some cartoon stuff too. And I just always wanted to do it. And I'm like, well, why would it and I, like there's no permission slip. Like just go do it. So I did. And I told you earlier, like I haven't released any of my stuff that I think is my best stuff thus far. Cause I'm going the same way. Like the first video came out, Biddy Bum. I don't know. I think it's like 1.3 million views organically, just on YouTube, which is kind of hard. And then the second one did better and it's gaining traction in different ways. And we've had the biggest record labels in the world reach out to my team now. And I'm like, he, he, he, no, wait, wait. You guys have to hear what comes after that. I'm not going to make a deal when you haven't even heard the good shit yet. Yeah. So it's just like part of the fun. It's like when you learn the skills that you can apply it to all the different things. That's what I learned with me when I learned the skills of like how to do funnels and persuasion and traffic. And it's like, and we talked about this. I just bought a ladies fitness company. I bought it, you know, some of the things you can apply it to where it's just like, you know, for you, it's the same, the same playbook. Entertainment is entertainment. Marketing is marketing. Yeah. Just do all of it. Like I look at old school entertainers. Those were my, my OGs, my favorites, the ones who would sing and dance and act and direct. I'm like, that's the shit. Like that's the good stuff. Do it at all. It's so cool. Yeah. So right now we're in the middle of like, like this cancel culture of everything. Right. So it's funny because I think you've done some videos talking about like, like making fun of that, like cancel me now. Like, um, Cancel me harder daddy. Yeah. I got to make that on a t-shirt, honestly. But it's curious because some people are so scared of like, oh, if I do this thing, then what's going to happen in the repercussions and everything. And like, um, love you talk about just like controversial marketing and like how you, yeah, like even how you're, Hold the line. You know what I mean? Hold the line. You will have way more people. So as we know, everybody is not your client. Everybody isn't just is what it is. Um, I think Mario Lopez is a fricking fantastic businessman and entrepreneur and he's so good at what he does. He wrestled on Saved by the Bell. So I love him because of that. Right. And I remember him saying to me recently, he's like, you know, my brand is in everybody. I want to be with everybody and whatever. So he never says anything, does anything that is outside the parameters of that awesome Mario Lopez brand. However, that doesn't work for everybody and that's okay. Uh, I can't think of the studies right now, but so many are if you choose a line and you hold it, your audience, even if they don't agree with you, they're like, oh, they have balls. You know, like subconsciously there's a, Hey, they know that's cool. I don't agree with them on this one. I have fans who will defend me now, even when they don't agree with me. Like, I don't agree with her on this one, but you know, she, she, I like that she's has the balls and she says it. So when it comes to actual brands, I think you have to get your board, literally your board on board that, Hey, this is our stance on XYZ or we think comedy is comedy and is what it is. We're not going to apologize because it served its purpose. Don't be dicks to be dicks. Like, yeah, it's kind of whatever, but especially in comedy and in advertising, it's okay to draw lines. It's a, if you don't, it won't be successful. If it's not like we love this, we hate this. That's how it's comedy 101. Find a thing and pick an attitude on it. It has to be like that with marketing. Interesting. This is kind of a funny side story, but we were, I was in Dean's plane flying to met with Tony. It's like a month or two ago and we landed the private airport, you know, with the, you know, the private planes and we got our plane and the plane next to us is the Mr. Pillow guy. Of course. And he walks down, I was like freaking out. So I'm like taking selfies, like trying to show. And then I was like, I looked at him because he went through with the whole Trump stuff, like when, you know, hardcore and he got canceled. Everyone kicked him out of the stores. Did he get canceled? That's so weird. Actually though, is he canceled? No, that doesn't say yesterday. I was flying home from Phoenix and the TV guy next to me in first class had the TV on and it was a Mr. Pillow commercial, like infomercial. I'm watching him and he's pitching the stuff and like, and he's just fascinating. Yeah. I was just looking at that because yeah, there was like, yes, he got hit, but also like, I didn't know who Mr. Pillow was until that whole controversy happened. That was awesome. Like now I knew who was like on the line of airport. Like there's the dude I'm taking selfies like from a hundred yards away, like like trying to like send my family. There's the Mr. Pillow guy. And like, I don't know who he was until he got canceled. And then now he's now, yeah. And now we're talking about on a podcast. Exactly. Like I've been canceled. We always joke. It's like, I think we're at 13 times now and like, am I canceled? Like, oh, she's canceled. No, I'm not. Ah, I'm like, canceled. You can't actually do that. And it's, there's going to be people who love you or hate you and whatever. You got to embrace both. Like seriously brands. I know it's the corporate culture. So that's why I love so many entrepreneurs that are leading the charge now that are actual entrepreneurs and they aren't just a suit doing this because they can say, no, this is a, this is a mitigated risk. We've gone through, hey, this could be awesome. Some people are going to love it. Some people are going to hate it. Everybody doesn't drink Pepsi. That's why there's Coke. It's okay to love and hate stuff. So those are my thoughts on it. Cash me outside girl. She spun that. She makes so much money. Do you know that? She's a good little rapper too. She's killer, but she spun it into a crazy career. And I think she was the top earner on OnlyFans last year. Never got any. She just has like that subscription model and she kills it. She went from standing up to Dr. Phil. Like whatever seems to be winning. Even in the political climate too, when people are like, oh, we don't want to be associated with this or with that side or whatever. It's like, just pick something, stand for something, or people think you're weak and you stand for nothing. And yeah, I haven't seen it miss. Yeah. Have you? In the short term or sometimes it feels like it, but then the long term though, it's interesting. It's extra people talking about you, your brand. So the thing about this, like some of the listening who's just got a, I mean, most of the people listening to ours are smaller entrepreneurs. They've got a course or product or something, you know, they're trying to sell it. And they're like, okay, this would be cool. I want to do what Nicole did. I wanted to set up four bases, three bases, get all that and crush something out there. How would you, how would you deconstruct that? Like a lady boss, let's say you just bought a brand new company and you want to put them into an MLM and you're a dude who owns the company. What would you do? Oh, you're, you're, you're milking me now. Oh gosh, this is, my team's laughing in the corner. They're like, don't say it. Well, I would need to know like your main products first. What makes you better than your competition? Who is your competition? I also love direct targeting competition aiming and firing. And that comes back to like the Adidas Nike thing. You know, that's the way, obviously it doesn't. It doesn't go poorly. When we launched ClickFunnels, we, that was conversation because there were our competitors. So our competitors initially was lead pages and it was infusion soft. And so at our big annual event, we had 5,000 people in the room and we gave everyone T-shirts to say we are not confusion soft and they have more. And then we can teach it out and it was, and this big thing so much so that the CEO ended up calling me and yelling at me like, why do you hate me so much? I'm like, I don't hate you. We just like the Joker. Like we got someone and, and they're definitely left ClickFunnels because they were offended but then other people loved it, became a thing. And then infusion soft literally changed their name to something different because we got everybody in the community like mocking them. In fact, I listened to an interview with the owner the other day and he kept talking about it. He said, the owner said confusion soft like 30 times from his podcast interview. And I was like, I can't believe we did that. Yeah, like it was crazy. But ever since then I've been shied away where I'm like, God, I have it. I don't know why like if it's because we got to learn level or I got nervous, but it works so well as we were building up. You're the boss in the boardroom, boss in the bedroom, be the boss of your health. Lady boss. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Like when it's ladies like you, there's like the whole girl, there was the girl power revolution with like spice girls. But now it's about being sassy and sexy and taking care of your kids. And we can do it all and look good in heels. So sometimes that means your time has to be with your kids. So you need the bar to take on the road with you on the way to the gym. Like, you know, there's like the key messaging that goes towards women that I don't know if your other people you talked about will be able to hit it. I'm just saying, I'm just saying, like you got to play on that lady boss thing. That's so fun. Yeah. So interesting. That's really fun. So I, if I were to deconstruct that, I wouldn't just do one ad. I know some people say that I like a series of ads, not just to test them across, but because your demo isn't just one thing usually, and then you can hit different people. So I, in the first video, for example, myself, I hit people who were making fun of that Instagram culture. Second video, I hit everybody who was married because it was about divorces. The third one, I gotta really look up what that third one was because I forget. And then the five people one was different. And then religious people, religious people. That was no, that came after. Yeah. But the religious ones too, like there's people who are very religious and people who think it's stupid. I got both of them in that video. So if your ad is only hitting one tiny demo. Looping in segments of the market. Yeah. So I have to attention around you and then coming in and like, Like, you know, there's your staff member who's like, I'm a vegan. Sorry. So he obviously remembers I was talking about vegans. So like, he's a little thin, a little malnourished looking, but whatever. Yeah. We all have hobbies and do silly things. I'm going to get, I'm just going to send you some dead animal. Okay. Just like take a bite out of it. Dude, you look like you've jaundiced. Just kidding. Like I'm just kidding. You look nice for a sickly person. But just that someone's going to laugh at that and buy carnivore crisps. They're my favorite. He's my code arbor 20. You did? I did. You're a candidate. Yes. So I was in Melody's car, Melody that we both love from doTERRA. I was in her car yesterday and actually in her pantry, she has like a whole carnivore crisp section now for me. And my, did you see my ad for carnivore crisps? No. You did. I did it in five minutes because I ate all the product before I made the ad. Well, that's the ad. That's the ad. So it was just a selfie video of me being like, well, I was supposed to do this thing for carnivore crisps, but beef brisket, I was really going to eat it. Next one. These were the crunchy, whatever's I ate them. I ate this one too. And I also ate those. They're good. Um, because I ate them. And my code, sorry, carnivore crisps. And it was their highest converting ad they've ever had. And it was just a selfie video. That's crazy. It was fun. So then when they ran the ad, they ran it, you posted it on your social. Oh, there's so much that you could do with Lady Boss because challenging women to be part of it is really fun. Like there's challenges you can do and like funny things. Like, do you remember the baloney that people were like sticking baloney their kids heads? Yes. Like it seems like there's something that like the moms could be doing with the bars or some kind of products or something. You know, like there's just so much fun you can have with like a female brand like that. We know how you do the consulting for all this stuff. That's so cool. It's fun. I told you I'm very selective. So we'll have to talk. We'll talk afterwards. I'm doing my stuff too. Yeah. So when so like the carnival ones, they post on your social, they take that that creative and run his ads somewhere else also, or is it just they were putting it on their socials as well too. And they were such a baby brand. I was just like brand new, brand new. I was just like, I know you can't afford me. I just want to do this because it keeps sending me your product. We'll figure it out. Lifetime food for free. Yeah, actually. And I was like, sure, I'll take a cut. We'll figure it out. That's the only brand in the last like ever that I'm like, just I believe in this product and this company. It's the best. It's so good. I want to take it over eventually or something. Yeah. Yeah, so good. It's so good. You eat meat. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to send you some. It's delicious. You're going to get hooked. Sweet. Yeah. We'll send them on. It'll be cool. Yeah. Trick them into it. Why wouldn't you eat an animal? It would eat you. It would eat you. How do you fight that logic? That is. If given. Exactly. It would. Star sharks and bears. They eat that first. This is what's crazy about the ocean. I thought this the other day about the ocean. I'm like, whoa, the ocean's crazy. Sometimes we eat them. Sometimes they eat us. Whoa. Like that's like flipped universe. Multiverse chef. Yes, like a big hat. Oh man. For mushrooms. For like mushroom chocolate. Dude, speak of mushrooms though. Go on. You eat one mushroom a day. It lowers your cancer risk by 40%. So like actual mushrooms or mushrooms with the? Probably actual. I don't know exactly. Okay. I just read the stat and I didn't go deeper. Okay, we'll find out. They have mushroom jerky nowadays though. So I'm going to buy mushroom jerky. Tastes like beef jerky, but it's made out of mushrooms. That sounds great. I love food that's made out of other food. To taste like other food, right, vegan? Yeah. We're going to. Toe furky. Thanksgiving's coming up. Toe furky. Let's do it. Toe furky. They make mushroom murky. You know what we need in our lives is more soy. That's gone well for us and humanity and men. Yes. And population growth. All that soy products in our bodies, ingestion. I've been on both sides of the soy argument. It's been interesting because I was helping a company whose core product was soy. So they like fought for it and then everyone fights against it. And I'm so confused now that I don't know what to do. I just like to look at it and I'm like. I don't know. I'm going to put some of this in my mouth sometimes. Not fair enough. We'll see where it goes from there. I almost made a dirty joke. I'm glad I left it alone. I just left it alone. There we go. We all know we were. Anyway, all right. So sometimes you don't have to say the thing to say it. Marketing. Sometimes you can have it. Oh, you know, it'd be great to as a series of ads with no sound in them whatsoever. Like just maybe an audio time just at the end, just like a situation. And it's like the only ads out there with no sound. And then you can show a product like a series of them. That's interesting. Soundless ads. Those are fun. To kind of like you were saying earlier about how like you'd lead there and you leave. I found that with when I'm speaking or if I'm selling from stage, if I tell, if I try to tell somebody something, then they feel like I'm telling them something. It's like, oh, that's a Russell thing. So instead, if I can, if I can create a story or an environment where then Austin, they think it and they have, then they thought it and I didn't think it. And then they're more likely to move and persuade, you know, run the back and buy the thing or whatever. And so it's like, how do you create stories like that? I've never tried it from an ad standpoint, but from like when I have a captive audience in a room, I can do that really well. I can tell a story, leave it somewhere and then stop. You do it. You're so good at it. And they don't take it and like, oh, they have the, they have the epiphany at the end. We're like, oh, I'm in charge. You know, like that was my thought. Yeah. That's like callbacks in comedy. That's the exact same. Explain that for me. So a callback in comedy for those of you who don't know is the technique where I've already said the punch line. And then later on in my set, the next time you do it, the audience is like, oh, I know what you were getting to. The audience feels smart, but you can do it in three, five and sevens. So you get to that third one. There might even be a moan on the third one. Like, oh, I'm going to do it again. You get to that fifth one. They go nuts. Like go back, watch Eddie Murphy. Any of the big comics is always at three, five, seven. And I do that in ads as well with people. Interesting. I've seen it before. I know it's called callback. Yeah. It's cool. And you do feel, yeah. It's similar to Super Easy Bear Link Comedian. It's Ryan George. Did you know him? Are you friends with him or do you follow him? Ryan George. No, but I will. He on the screen right now, he has a channel called Pitch Meeting. And it's like, it's the best thing on YouTube, but it's him talking to himself. He's the one. Oh, that's amazing. One, he's the writer who just wrote a new, like I just wrote, I just wrote a venture end game. And then he's pitching into the producer and then go back and forth. But they had to sit, he's done like 500 episodes. And then people die, but they don't actually. Yeah. Oh, it's so funny. You would love it from a colleague. He's a great comedian, but like every time, every, all 500 episodes, you get three or four, like each character has the same line. And so like, now I've watched all 500 episodes every single time I'm like waiting, waiting. And he's like, yeah, he did it. And like y'all freak out and we all laugh. And it's like that build up just waiting for the line every single time. Anyway, it's super fascinating. Exactly. You didn't get the joke because you're malnourished. See, there it worked. I'm sorry, vegans have feelings too. I've heard. So they say. I love you fighting your laughter. That's actually my new favorite thing. It was because of like, I was like, you're just right here. I love it. You're like, Nicole, don't. But it's funny. But like your face is hemorrhaging. That's probably how I watch most of your videos. If I was like, oh my gosh, I can't believe you're saying that. Like, yeah, like. Someone get him a squatty potty. We have. No, not here. Oh my gosh. We did get squatty potties all over my house though. Like I'm a sucker for good ads. Good ads. We have to like, I need to support them because the ad was so good. I feel that way too. Yeah. I want to buy it. Take my money. You're funny. Take my money. So Nicole, you're the first person to be in the room. So we're not telling people we're in a secret location and we're keeping it secret because someone's going to rob me. I don't even know where I am. I would say conservatively in the last 12 months I've probably spent $6 million on books. So you're in the middle of some of the most rare cool books. But I'm curious for you. So you, the first book you read, what was it called when you were sick and you went into the library and you bought it? The Louis Hay You Can Heal Your Life. Yes. So I'm curious after that book, like were you in the person film prior to that? Was that the first? Nope. That was the first. So what other books based, like personal things have you read or audiobooks, whatever that had a big impact on you? Do you have favorites or? I do. So I think Louis Hay is an OG. I know people say bad things, but who cares? I love Joel Osteen. I love his books specifically. I think they're really helpful. Joyce Meyer is my homegirl. Do you know her? Are you familiar? She's a preacher, a female preacher. And her books are just awesome because she has the voice of a comedian, like an old female, like a Joan Rivers, like comedic voice and the way she types even. Mixed with, she's a Christian preacher. So she's teaching you lessons and stuff from the Bible, but she's given real dirt on it and being funny. So I freaking love all that stuff and she tells it like it is. So I always like that. By the way, I met Joan River and have a picture with her. Do you really? Yes. You know, one of my like regrets, you're like, I got that one. I collected that infinity stone. One of my like kind of regrets, but life is what it is, is that I didn't understand her comedy while she was alive. I always was like, she's just mean. She's just mean. And I didn't get the art of the roast that she was such a freaking phenom at until years later. I think I was just too young to understand it maybe. But now I'm like, whoo, she was good and she was right. She was ahead of her time. Like she's great. And then bookwise like Dom Miguel Ríaz. I love him and I love the alchemist. I told you I've read it so many times I forget, but anytime something big happens in my life, I go back and read it. I buy everybody who has a baby the same book. And it's Oh, the places you'll go by Dr. Seuss. Interesting. Have you read that? Guys, you got to reread that book. A long, long, long time ago. When you read that now, you're like, whoa, that's knowledge bombs. And I get that for everybody who has a kid. And I always write them a big letter in it about what was going on at that time, about their parents and about who I am in their life and all that kind of stuff, give them a little wish for the future. But that book gives you a lot of awesome lessons and just like this. Like it talks about haters. It talks about how you're going to fail sometimes and that's okay. And just be brave and go for things. I get chills thinking about that. Like Dr. Seuss knew what's up. And then one time this guy gifted me a trilogy, but there was four books in it. It's right here. Hey, three, four. Yeah. Like it literally says the secrets trilogy on it. I got to pick this up. It also weighs 70,000 pounds. I use this as a weight as well. It's the secrets trilogy, but there are four books. It makes me laugh. Those are like, those are some of my favorites. And like, yeah, like laws of success. And I've read Tony Robbins stuff and I've gotten into everything I can get my hands on too. I, similar to you, I just love learning that side of it. And I have to reset myself because you know, shit goes on in life and in business and whatever. And I'm like, I need to reset. And then I go back and I'm like, oh yeah, this happens to everybody and keep your mind focused and. Always a constant reset. It's a lot of chaos, right? Like everything starts and it gets more and more chaotic and you have to reset it. And then like that's just constantly in all parts of life. Is that why you prefer to like have your main business in a state that's more chill? Is that part of it? Does that help you with the chaos? Not necessarily. More so is why I was, yeah. Here's where I'm here. Yeah, I'm in Boise. I don't want to move. So yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah. But I love it here because it's, it's, I mean, you know, it's hard to get here. Yeah. Yes, it is. There's no place. We were booking and we're like, nobody gets there. We're going to have to fly ourselves. Basically, yeah. I do get, yeah. Grant tried to sell me his private jet like a year ago and I was like, they have not fit in Boise. That's like the size of Boise. See, they couldn't work anyway, but it would have been amazing. Fair enough. Yeah. So, so I've lost someone to ask you and this is actually, I know we just met today, like personally, so it's been really cool getting to know you, but. Internet friends. But I've been watching you for years, but I'm really excited for you and I'm sure you understand how big it is. I think this is going to be the biggest thing you've done so far is actually the podcast because the podcast is such a distribution channel and everything you do in socially is amazing. You built huge following and followed, but like those things come and go because of algorithms and because of annoying things where I feel like you're taking this energy and this built up momentum and putting it into a show like that that I feel like is going to take you like, anyway. So I'm excited for you, but talk about that a little bit. Talk about the show because I think it's a big deal. I appreciate that so much and like you were the umpteenth person who said that to me and I think there is, which is exciting and thank you. And I think there's something to be said about like me in long form because I everybody who may have a preconceived notion of me, the second the are actually in conversation or in a room with me and it's like long form conversation. They're like, oh, oh, you're not okay. Or oh, I thought you were this 22 second video. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Exactly. Oh, you're smarter than you look. I'm like, yeah, I get that a lot. But I just think it'll just like kind of open people and I like exploring humanity too. I don't want to just be a quick like click bait sound bite. That's not even me. It's just like a fun game. Yeah. So the show is called the Arboreffect, AA, like AA. And it starts with like a monologue type of thing. Like I'm going late night styles because gosh, I love those old late night guys. It was so good. And then after that we have a guest and I like to keep it topic based. So whatever I'm doing my monologue on is what the guest is going to be on. And I would love to have you on. I would be insanely cool. Yay. I'd be honored. Yay. I'm like, what topic would it be? Like because there's so much we could do, but we'll hone it in. I'm super, super pumped. And the list of guests is so massive. Someone asked, you know, who's the number one guest I want to have on? Because I know I can get like super cool people that I'm friends with and whatever, which is great. I'm excited. But the number one guest that I want is the Pope. Oh, that'd be cool. I want to ask the Pope via his translator some very specific questions that I think would alleviate a lot of fighting, especially in America, because people hide behind religion as a reason to do this to people I've seen a lot, which is the opposite of what we're actually supposed to do with religion. If you're following it. And I just want to be like, yeah. Yeah. Was Christ like super judgy or did I miss that part? Like he flipped the table once. Fair enough. We all have. But I'm flipping this after. But yeah, I just think it would be really cool to go straight to the head of that source on earth and be like, here's the questions. Here's the things that people keep fighting about in the name of religion. Let's say you, you know, that's my number one. That'd be so cool. Right. I want to put it out there. Yeah. How would you get that? Who's the connection point? Tony Robbins. Tony knows everybody. Tony knows everybody. He'd be the one. That's fun. Okay. I'll call Jerrick to call his dad. I'm just kidding. Well, I don't even need that extra one. I'm sitting with you. You're like another leg of Tony's. Yeah. Oh, so cool. Thanks for coming to Boy's Things, hanging out. Get away to your funnel live.
