There's so many names in this world. We should have gone visit Myron. He's in Tampa. Yeah. Dang it. Another name. No, too many names. No more people. The man! Russell! Hey, DeSauya product. Love this guy. I honestly believe the Archbrewers are the only people that can actually change this planet. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. I'm really amazed. This is he died of oxyclic cut-offs and perjals. You know like if you'd ask nine months before I gave you a die once before you got out of your ass, please don't stop. It's my legacy. It's my ambition. You know, they didn't stop running his ads. No. It's like I don't know who's he is. I might tell everybody about it. I'm proud of my... I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I just think his heart. I thought, oh my god, I died, so he's running his crap. You know what I told him? I said, keep running because it will absolutely convert stronger. I'll be in the news that this guy died. We shouldn't shoot him. Oh yes. I swear to God this is why we have a problem. We thought about it at the same time. Hey man if you're watching this, I'm dead. Doesn't mean my product is. I'm totally cool with this. My product's still the best that I've planted. This guy said running out of newspaper they said, what's the worst that can happen? They said, Joann's husband lived in the flower with his body in wardrobe for 48 hours. There's the article, the right below is the ad. Wardrobe specials. Literally the same keyword on both things. This is why you need traffic secrets. So Joel Marion, back in the day, he won Phil Phillips body for life. So when I first met him, he was just beginning. He went through all my courses, which is cool. He told me things. And then I said five, six years later, he's like the key picker in the industry. He's like the boss. He'd put together huge events. Him and Josh Bazzoni, they launched Biotrust together. They blew up and did $100 million like the first like eight months or something crazy like that. He's insanely aggressive on everything he does. He doesn't have one. He's just like, hey, we're going to town for now cause he's been asking me for a year to be on his podcast. And I'm always like, whenever I'm Florida. It's now like, well, when I'm Florida, let's do it. How you doing? It's Dan. How are you? That was like two or three. I give him a hotel or something. Oh my gosh. Joe, you dropped that. Wow. Yeah, that was me. It took a while. It's two years worth of paint on the ceiling. Every ceiling is hand painted. We're moving to Florida. Good. New ClickFunnels office? All right. So we have an idea. We have something we're passionate about. What does an irresistible offer look like? And just explain that concept so people know. It has to be overwhelming amount of value for the right price, right? So go ahead. I always try to make it, like if I'm creating an offer, I try to make sure that it's worth 10 times I'm charging for. So that's the, that's the lens. Like if it's not worth a thousand bucks, I'm not going to sell for a hundred. It's not worth a hundred and I'm not going to sell for 10. So that's the first thing. And there's a lot of ways to explain it. We actually do an event each year with family. So I let parents come and they can bring their teenage kids. And so it was the very first time we ever did it last summer. And I'm trying to explain how to create an offer to the adults and the adults are kind of like glossing over. And looking out and the kids are like nodding their heads like, and so I'm like, I wonder if the kids are getting this. So I had like seven or eight of them come on stage, come on stage. They all came up and I started picking ideas. I'm like, okay, let's say you started a lawn mowing company. Like what would an irresistible offer be? And we should do this a bunch of times. And there's this girl who, you know, she's little tiny girl. And I'm like, what's your business? She's like, I'm a babysitter. I was like, okay, how many other girls do you know? They're babysitters. All my friends babysit. I make it how much do you charge? She's like, well, we all charge on a five bucks an hour for babysitting. I was like, okay, so you all have the exact same offer. I was like, how do you make your offer more irresistible? And she has a smile on her face and she'd been taking notes while we were going through offer. She's like, it depends how small the baby is. Like if it's actually like a baby or going to school, you can like teach it ABC so it can learn to like go to school. I love that. Love it. Well, my new babysitting offer is this. She's like, I'm not just a babysitter. I'm actually a mentor for your kids. And when I babysit and your kids come in, I'm not gonna sit there and watch TV with them. We're gonna sit and we're gonna read together. And then when I'm gonna make them a meal, it's gonna be a healthy meal. And then after the meal, I'm gonna clean up the dishes, we're gonna clean these up. I'll make sure your kids are in bed before they show up. Not only are they gonna watch Nora, they're also gonna clean our entire house. They're gonna teach her the ABCs. She's got no screen time. She's gonna be NAD? NAD. NAD, oh yeah. My handwriting is the best ever. And she had this whole list of all the things she's gonna do versus all the other babysitters. And she had this offer stack of here's everything you're gonna get. I was like, oh my gosh, I would pay you $20 an hour to babysit my kids right now because of your offer is so much better than anybody else's. And also I looked at it, I saw the adults getting like, oh, that's when the one's buying my stuff because it's just as valuable. Everyone's got the same product out here, right? If you look at our brainstorming sessions at ClickFunnels, it's literally that. It's a myth that we're all sophisticated and we have a pattern in our processes. No, it's a bunch of us sitting in a room. Right, what if we do this? What if we do this? What if we do this? Okay, this is how I know if it's a good idea. If I'm like, hey, what if we do this? Dave's like, oh, that's a good idea. I'm like, that night has sucked. If I go, what do you think about this? Dave's like, oh my gosh, that's amazing. That's how we know it's a part of our offer. The differentiation is everything. 100%, yeah, like typically most people are selling commodity, right? Like you can buy an, like my iPhone, I can buy my iPhone at Best Buy or Apple.com or like it's a commodity, you can buy it anywhere, right? So like, how do we turn that into an irresistible offer? I did this on stage one time in an event. I said, okay, this is my iPhone. I just bought it with 600 bucks. Like, who would give me 600 bucks for it? You know, everyone's, you know, half the audience's hands go up and I'm like, but I want you to auction off my phone right now. I bet you within, within 10, within five minutes now, I bet you I can get somebody in this room to give me $100,000 for this phone. I'm like, anyone want to give me 100 grand for phone and no one raises their hands? I was like, okay. So inside my phone, just so you know, over the last 15 years, I bought every marketing sales and personal development course known to me. Like there's not one that's come through I haven't bought. There's over $750,000 in marketing sales and persuasion courses. And at the very beginning of time, until now, it's never come out I own. I know like, I spend so much time on eBay looking for old marketing courses that you can't find anywhere. When they pop up, I buy them, I get them, put it in my phone and they're there. So they get the courses and send them to my brother. My brother rips all the audios and the videos and puts them into MP4 files and they're on my iBooks. I say, here's my iBooks account. I show it through, I scroll through thousands of courses. Like every course you can dream of. Most of them are out of print now. You can't get them anywhere. They're only here. So there's, there's $800,000 for the courses that are on my phone, you plug it in, you list it. Number two, here's my address book. I'm like, there's Tony Robbins. Richard Branson, Garrett White, send me your my phone, you also get my whole contact list of all the top influencers in the world. If you have my phone, you can call any of them and just ask and tell them that you got my phone and you had a question for me. You can talk to them. Let's see, what else, what else can I put on there? My email's on there so you have access to every contact, every vendor I use. You have my social platforms. You log into Facebook, Instagram. There's over a million on it's versions. I'm like, and then I start going through all the things on my phone. And then I was like, I'm gonna do live auction here. I said, who here are giving me 600 bucks on my phone? Boom, every hand goes up. Gaff, we went to $5,000. $10,000. $20,000. $25,000. $30,000. $40,000. $50,000. $100,000. $200,000. Every point, a couple of hands dropped. By the time we ended, I got up to $500,000. There were six guys in the audience, still had hands up. I'm like, if you guys are serious, come on stage right now. You gotta be ready to write this check right now. Six guys come up, 500 grand. Willing to pay 500 grand for my phone. I'm like, why would you, like, two minutes ago you went and paid 600 bucks for this thing. Why? And he's like, I had the mic to one guy and he said, based on what's on that phone, that's actually a really, really good deal. And I was like, that's the same iPhone, right? Like, we have to become good at like, how do you package things to make this offer legitimately irresistible? And that's the mindset you guys have to have as you're creating something. Otherwise, you're just a commodity, you're just an iPhone, like everybody else. You can buy from anyone. This iPhone, it's specialist, unique. It's the value of the iPhone. But Russell's like, you can just go buy it in Best Buy. It's the same thing. What did I do? I picked a market that I understand and I create an offer that will blow their minds. Right, and now you need your traffic secrets so that you know how to fill that up. So, where do people go to get the, where's the best place?
