## Transcript
Hey friend, this is Russell and today's video, we're gonna show you exactly how to build an email as fast and also for free. And I'm gonna show you guys four steps to get your first 100,000 subscribers. The more people on your email list, the more money you're gonna make, right? People always tell me like, you can make money with a small list. I'm like, yeah, you can, but you can make a lot more with a big list. So today's video is gonna show you guys a little bit deeper about how do we actually grow this thing from a list of 1,000, 2,000 people to 100,000 people and beyond, using some really cool things that will also build your brand and help you get a lot of traffic. So with that said, we're gonna jump right in. A couple things though real quick, if you can give me a favorite, any ah-has you get during this video, please post them in the comments down below. It means the world to me. Also like this video. My love language is physical touch and I wish I could give you a hug through the screen, but because I can't, the next, my second love language is words of affirmation. So anything you put in the comments down below, I will read. It will make me feel great and get me more excited about making more videos for you. So with that said, I'm gonna jump right into today's video. Step number one, when walking is through the strategy, okay? Now, the cool thing about this strategy, this is something that's actually very simple and very easy. Some of the strategy we get become very, very complex. And I'm one of the worst people at this because I'm obsessed with building funnels and driving traffic and all sorts of stuff. And I've got tons of offers and courses and masterminds and things. I do a lot of stuff. For most of you guys, you can build a list of 100,000 people and have a very simple one man operation. It really does not have to be any more difficult than that. I'm gonna walk you through this strategy. If I was to lose everything and try to simplify things, this is exactly what I would do because I could do it by myself or maybe just one or two part-time employees if you needed some help along the way. All right, so the first step in this strategy is you gotta simplify your business. Most of us, and I would put me, have very complex businesses. And so I look at my friend Ben Settle as a really good example of a business model that anybody can replicate. It's very simple, it's very easy. He's been running it by himself for almost 20 years now. And so for any of you guys who are looking for a simple business that you can make a lot of money using emails, this is the foundation of it. So if you go to bensettle.com and you wanna see this model, in fact, most of you guys probably never heard of Ben Settle because he's not on social media, he's not running ads. Yeah, he's been running this business successfully for two decades. But if you go to bensettle.com, it asks you for your email address and from there you can put on his email list and then obviously on the backside of your email list, he sells one product. He only has one product, it's a $97 a month print newsletter and every single day he sends out an email about his print newsletter. That's it, that's the entire business model. It's not more complicated than that. The landing page, we get an email address, one core offer you sell and he sends an email every single day talking about the exact same offer, consistently out for 20 years. In fact, if you look at this right here, I just took a quick snapshot, but this is the daily emails. Yeah, I've been getting a daily email from him for, I launched ClickFunnels 10 years ago and this is before I launched ClickFunnels. So over a decade, I've been getting a daily email he's almost never missed a day. Maybe once or twice here and there, but it's pretty consistent, right? Always talking about his one core offer. You may be thinking like, how in the world does someone talk about the exact same offer every single day for a decade or maybe two decades, right? It's hard. A lot of us, we said three emails for a list about a product and we run away from it, never talk about it again, right? The reality is your people want to hear from you over and over and over again about the thing you're trying to sell if you do it correctly. If you're doing email marketing like most businesses do, when they send out these big newsletters with all these stats and figures and stats are very corporately looking things, it's not gonna work. Just like we don't go watch TV for corporate things, we watch TV for fun, for entertainment, right? If you ship your email marketing, like how you're gonna run your email marketing business into entertainment, it'll ship everything for you. That brings me now to step number two, which is called our daily Seinfeld emails. Now, most of the people from my generation know who Seinfeld was, Jerry Seinfeld. A lot of younger people, a lot of you guys on YouTube may not know who they are. Let me know in the comments, are you a Seinfeld fan? Are you like, sign who? My kids never heard of him, a lot of their friends. It's kind of crazy to me, but this was the greatest TV show of the 90s. We all watched it every single day and we knew what it was. But if you ask somebody, what was Seinfeld about? What was the show about? The joke is it's a show about nothing. Now, for those who haven't seen, let me tell you about one of the greatest parts of the Seinfeld show. After it had been on for four or five seasons, Jerry meets an executive NBC and they want to make a show about his life, right? And so they're pitching the show. This is what the Seinfeld show would be about. That goes to show about nothing. And like, what do you mean it's about nothing? Well, for example, went to a coffee shop today, that would be an episode. Or we were in a Chinese restaurant today and we couldn't get a table, that could be an episode. Went to the doctor's day, that would be an episode. And the whole joke was like, it's a show about nothing. Yet why was it the most successful sitcom in the history of all time? It's because every single time we showed up to watch the show about nothing, because they entertained us, we fell in love with the characters, wanted to see what they were up to every single day. And if you look at how Ben Settle does his emails, he's following the exact same process. Okay, again, it's called daily Seinfeld emails. Every single day what he's doing is he's not going out there and like teaching you a bunch of stuff and indoctrinating. What he's doing is looking at, what's the core thing he's selling? And then from there, he's finding a story that happened in his personal life. Something cool, something interesting, and he's sending an email about that story. Now how do you structure these emails? If you've followed me for any amount of time, you know that I teach a lot of different frameworks. My favorite framework is Hook's story offer, right? We use Hook's story offer in everything. And we also use them in our emails. So you think about Hook. Hook is the thing to get somebody to stop in their inbox, right, to see your emails. So they're seeing like 500 emails that came in today. The Hook is the thing that's going to grab their attention and stop them, right? So the Hook is your subject line of your email, right? Then the body, you're going to tell a story. What's the story? Okay, again, it's the daily Seinfeld email story. So for me, what the daily Seinfelds are is, let's say I'm selling a weight loss product. If I have another email talking about the nutritional facts and blah, blah, blah, that's not going to be useful, right? Instead, what the email story is going to be about is something that happened in my life that somehow relates back to the product. So for example, maybe I was out running today and as I was working out, I thought I was doing this whole thing and you tell the whole story and then, oh, by the way, if you're not a subscriber yet, go to bubbleball.com, right? So it's Hook's story offer, Hook's story offer, but the story is just a story that's happening in your life. This is entertainment, you're entertaining people, you're educating, you're bringing in building connection with them. Those are the emails that do best for us, okay? So for example, a good example, is my DotCom secrets book, which by the way, this is the first time I taught people about daily Seinfeld emails and it talks about it all here. You know, if I want to sell a lot of copies of this book, I can't have a three day email campaign selling it and then move on, right? I got to talk about this consistently. So what I'm doing is I'm thinking about the principles inside of my book. What's the story that happens to me in my real life that I can tell that story and then push people back to the book? So for example, inside this book, I have a framework about a concept called the value ladder, right? So for example, I might go and tell a story about, hey, I was walking into Walmart the other day with my kids, it was late at night because of bubble, bubble, bubble, and I noticed that they sold me and then they had upsell and I told the story that happened to me in Walmart, right? It has nothing to do with anything, so for the end it's like, hey, if you want to learn how to use upsell inside your business, go to dotcomsecrets.com and get a free copy of your book, right? And so every single day, Ben Settle sends out a daily, sign filled email that's telling a story, somehow relates back to his core thing. Now what's crazy is after I wrote the dotcom secrets book, I had a client who paid me $100,000 to come to their office and consult their entire staff and their entire team. And I remember it was crazy because I showed up and I'm like, hey, what do you want me to, like, I was ready to teach them everything. He's like, if you can just help my staff, like if you can convince them that daily sign filled emails are important for us, it'll change our entire business. I was like, are you serious? He's like, I need them, like all of our emails are very corporatey and I hate it. And so I took the entire marketing team and we spent the entire day talking about this one concept of daily sign filled emails. It made every single person in the company each write a daily sign filled email. Like an example from their life that tied back to the product or service they were selling. And it was cool because within an hour, they all wrote an email. We had every single person read it. It was crazy. Sometimes people were laughing, sometimes they were crying, but every single person had a story that somehow related back to their core offer as a business. So that's what the daily sign filled emails are. That's what gives you the ability to very simply and very easily just continue to talk about your product over and over and over again. So again, Ben Settle, he's selling his print newsletter and from there every single day, he's telling a sign filled email, pushing people back. And then if you wanna see examples of this, by the way, if you go to benstettle.com, after you give him an email address, he takes you to a blog. And every time he sends an email to his list, he posts it on his blog. So you can literally see a decade worth of daily sign filled emails, examples of them on his blog. So if you wanna see more examples, check that out. Or if you look at a lot of the emails I sent out there, also follow the same process. That moved me now to step number three, okay? So we have the process, like the squeeze page, we have the daily sign filled emails. Now how do we build our list? How do we get people to start coming in and joining our list, right? And again, there's a lot of paid ways you guys know about Facebook ads and Google ads, Instagram. There's paid ways to do it, but I'm always looking for how do we get free traffic? Free traffic is always the best because you don't have to pay for it. And so I'm gonna show you guys some of the coolest ways to get free traffic into your pages, right? Okay, so the way you start getting free traffic is you start publishing and you're putting things out there to get your future dream customers to want to come to you. And I had a friend a couple of years ago, he posted, this is like on New Year's Day of 2020, he posted this and it was one of the coolest things. I've never seen him, his name's Eric Lofholm, it was January 2nd, he said, gave speech number one of 2020, I'm shooting for 550 speeches this year. I remember seeing that and I was like, that's like two speeches a day, how are you gonna do that consistently? Like there's no way this is gonna work for him, right? That was the first thing he put out there, he made a speech to an audience. Day number two, he posted this, January 4th, he said, my goal this year is to do 550 speeches. So far, I've been posting my year to date results and I've had two people reach out to me to book me. Yay, no speeches today, I'm at seven for the year so far. A few people asked me my definition of a speech, here it is, a talk that reaches two or more people. This is including guest speakers at a sales meeting, delivering a seminar, being on a podcast, delivering a webinar, delivering a keynote or corporate training. If you'd like me to do a talk for your team or group, let me know, sometimes I do them for free, sometimes for free, it depends on the intent of the talk. Talks to network marketing teams and sales teams are almost always done for free, thank you for following along my 2020 speaking journey. So notice what happened so far, he did one or two speeches, not much traction, dating number four is at seven speeches, he tells me this is what speech actually is, how it works, again, Eric's following at this time was not very big, he didn't have people lining up and giving speeches, but he put it out there into the world, he started talking about speaking, right? Here we are January 6th, I'm all in on my goals for 2020, here are my results for today. I delivered five speeches, had nine coaching calls, booked two speeches, created four pieces of content, delivered one sales presentation, added two members to my team. My speech goal is 550 for the year, I'm at 12 speeches so far a year today. All right, here we are January 8th, three speeches so far today, reached about 300 people this morning, 20-20 goals for 550 speeches, 18 speeches for the year today so far, three more speeches, 22 speeches year today, okay? January 13th, six speeches today, 32 year today, okay? He's 13 days in, he's at 32 speeches, each speech he's pushed people back to a squeeze page, how many people think he'll join his list so far? All by starting this challenge, okay, let's keep going though, January 14th, eight speeches today, unofficial world record for motivational sales training one day, 40 speeches a month a day, 550 is the goal, January 15th, three speeches a day, 43 year today, January 16th, five speeches, 48 year today, January 17th, two speeches a day, 50 year today, okay? He's not even a month, he's at 50 speeches, now he's at January 25th, five speeches a day, 55 year today, January 27th, seven speeches today, a 62 year today, January 23rd, three speeches today, 68 year today, three speeches a day, on January 22nd, 65 year today, keeps going, keeps growing, keeps growing, see he's getting the momentum, more speeches, more podcast interviews, more YouTube videos, like keeps growing and growing, this is 24 days in a month, just by putting it out there, setting it as a goal, okay? 24th, six speeches a day, 74 year today, 27th, four speeches a day, 78 year today, February 3rd, four speeches a day, 98 year today, February 14th, two speeches a day, 127 year today, February 24th, six speeches a day, 148 years today, okay, this is crazy, February 28th, two speeches a day, February 28th, 157 speeches he's done so far, okay? March 4th, two speeches a day, three more to go today, March 4th, four speeches a day, 169 a year today, March 19th, four virtual speeches a day, 202 a year today, that's my stop taking screenshots, okay? Do you see how you do this? If you want people to join your list and to want to listen and hear from you, you've got to be out there speaking to get people to come to you, okay? That's the power, that's the magic sauce. Now you can do it like Eric did and call it out and every single day start doing that kind of thing, which is great, but you can also do outreach, right? People always ask me, well, Russell, it's good for you, it's easy for you because you can get on people's podcasts, YouTube channels, it's not, like it's harder for me, okay? Well, Eric just said this way, and by March 19th, he had 202 speeches. For you, if you made this a goal, how many things you could get, okay? Let me show you a couple of secrets. Number one, the easiest way is grab your phone, open up the podcasting app, and we get the podcasting app open, Apple Podcasts. It's really cool because it shows you all the podcasts, but if you dig a little deeper here on the podcast app, so you're here on the home screen, and if you click over here on the browse button, it's gonna show you a bunch of different podcasts, and if you come out here to top shows, click on that, it's gonna show you all the top shows. He's the top 200 podcasts on iTunes, but I'm not looking to be on the top 200 podcasts, right? I'm gonna go niche specific, so I click up here in all categories, and it shows me all the different categories, right? So there's news, comedy, culture, business, true crime, sports, you see all the categories, right? So let's say I am in the health and fitness market, I click on health fitness, and boom, check it out, these are the top 200 podcasts in the health and fitness market, right? So see all the podcasts, I can start messaging people, say, hey, I've got a really cool presentation I can give on how to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and start contacting 200 people, right? Now you're not gonna get 200 yeses, okay? But from the 200 people you mess it out, you might get 20 yeses or 10 yeses, right? Now you got 10 presentations, and after you know the podcast, you can leverage that to get another podcast, another one, you can go to YouTube channels, you're the same thing, right? This is how you start getting your message out there. If you always ask me, how do you build a list for free? Like, go ahead and pay for ads, right? But if I want free traffic, I'm gonna put myself out there, right? You either buy your way in by buying ads, or you work your way in by getting your message out there. It's all about giving presentations, giving speeches, being on podcasts, being on an interview, things like that, okay? And so this is the way Eric did it, it was one of my favorite things to see because he's went out there brunt, like brute force, doing the things, setting the goal, and by posting it, more and more people start coming, and they start seeing it, and then he's speaking at this event, right? He had 30 people there, and from there, one or two people saw him, and they said, you speak at mine as well. And they kept opening up doors and doors, and soon his message was being out there to tens of thousands of people, all now who are gonna be coming back, joining his list, that he can sell them stuff in the future, all right? So that's how you publish for your dream customers. All right, step number four, the last question people ask me all the time, is, K-Russell, I understand, like, on the podcast app, how to find people, but like, what's the best way to really get in front of a whole bunch of people with your message and with your presentations? And so step number four is finding the right audiences, but before I jump into that, I wanna give you a quick message from our sponsors. The sponsors mean. So if you want to build your very first business online, the very first step is getting this book right here called Dotcom Secrets. It's been read by over 300,000 people. In fact, people like Tony Robbins said, this book is a simple process that any company can use to geometrically improve the traffic, conversions and sales online. Dan Kennedy, the goat of online marketing, also said that you go into this book in search of deep understanding and profound clarity about the structure and the science and effective marketing to be applied in the online media universe. You can see testimonies from tons of other people you've probably seen online. Most of the top gurus online became that by first reading this book and then applying the principles to build their following and their audiences. And so if you don't have a copy yet, you can get a free copy at dotcomsecrets.com and I hope you love this book. It will change your business and it might even change your life. All right, with that said, let's jump into the very last step here. So the question is where do we find these people? And so you may have heard me talk about this in the past. This is one of my favorite frameworks to share with people. It's called the Dream 100. The Dream 100 comes down to two things. Number one, figuring out who is your dream customer? Who's the person you wanna serve, right? The person who's gonna be buying your products, buying your services in the future. And the second step is figure out where are those people already hanging out? Now I already showed you one secret, right? Going to the podcast staff and finding out, okay, my dream customers, here's the 200 podcasts they're listening to, right? So I'm either gonna go and buy ads on those 200 podcasts or try to get my message onto them, right? And so that's number one. But how else do we do this in other places, right? So if you look at this chart here, this is what my Dream 100 board looks like. I literally, for me, I put it in Trello and I created Trello board right on top of Facebook groups. I have Facebook fan pages. I've got Instagram, I've got podcasts. I've got YouTube, I've got email lists. I've got blogs and I make categories across the top of where I know my dream customers are already congregating. And then down below, I start listing out who are all of the different people in each place, right? So again, an example of podcasts. I would put podcasts at the top and I'd write, here's the top 200 podcasts of my dream customers. These people here that I want anyway, they're already listing those podcasts. I want the big secrets about traffic. You don't have to generate traffic. Traffic's already happening. If you've got who already has the traffic, how do you get my message out in front of them, right? So I put podcasts, list 200 podcasts. Then I put Facebook groups. I go and list the 200 top Facebook groups. If I'm selling a wrestling product, type in wrestling. Now, so here's all the Facebook groups for wrestlers. If I'm doing photography, type in photography, here's all the Facebook groups with people who are doing photography. And I make a list of as many Facebook groups as I can find. Then I find who are the influencers on Facebook who have already congregated my dream audience, right? I find all the people, I make a list of those people. And then I go to Instagram, who are the Instagram influencers who already have all my dream customers there? And I make a list of those people, right? And who are the people I've email list of all my dream customers? I find those people, right? And who have blogs that my dream customers are reading? And so I make this list. We call it dream 100 list, because if you pick 10, if I find 10 people each column, that's 100 people. But typically when I'm launching a new book, or a new software company, or a new webinar, or a new offer, whatever, I go and I build a new dream 100 list. And usually the dream 100 list becomes closer like a dream 400 or 500 for me, because I want to find all those people, right? So I have this dream, you know, 400 or 500. And then I start going to these people and start messaging them about me doing presentations to their audience, right? Hey, I want to do a presentation. I can be on a podcast interview. Can we do YouTube videos again? And I start contacting them, right? This game is all about getting good at hearing no. I've been doing this for a long time, like a lot of relationships. When I launch a new book, I might message, you know, 400 people. From that I might get 100 people, say, yeah, I'm gonna promote. And from that, maybe 30 people who actually promote. Okay, it's just, it's the whole world's a funnel, right? It's just a funnel game. So if you use the same thing, like, you build a list of your dream 100, one of the big fears like, if I contact, what if I contact them and they say no? The reality is most of them will, in fact, most won't even respond back to you initially, right? It's getting out there, putting the message out there, right? And if you message dream 100, you get 10 people say yes, you get three who actually do it. Boom, now you got three presentations that you're putting out there in front of their audiences. And those people coming back to your squeeze page, they're getting your daily, sign filled emails, and now you can mark it to them over and over and over again. Okay, so that's the game plan. Now, one of the big secrets for the dream 100, I don't talk about this a lot, but this is something that might help you guys. When I first got started doing my first dream 100, I remember I had my list of who, like I wanted Tony Robbins and Joe Vitale, and I had these lists of people, right? I was like a little no-name Russell, like, no one, none of these guys responded, I send them messages and guess what happened? Nothing, nobody responded back. My biggest fear is like, they're gonna make fun of me. It didn't even get to that point, they didn't even message me, right? So it wasn't that big of a deal. And I messaged all these people up here, I'm like, they're not responding, why not? I thought, maybe, maybe like, I'm not ready for those people yet. So I started looking at like these different levels, right? I'm influenced, like I had a list of like a thousand people at times, I found who do people have like 10,000 people on list? And then, you know, 50, and I started looking at the different tiers, right? I said, so instead of me going to like the biggest people in the industry, what if I went to people like one tier above me, right? My list is the thousand people, my podcast has 500 people on it. We find people who got 10,000 people, right? So I started finding those people, guess what, they're much easier to get a hold of, they're easier to talk to, it's easier to do deals with them, right? So I started on this small tier, and what happened is I started doing deals with this small tier, right? And these people started promoting me, we started having more success, from there people started doing my email list, and also my list grew from a thousand people to 10,000 people. My business is the same level of these guys. I looked, what's one tier up? Okay, who do people have 30,000 people on their email list? I started contacting them, getting a hold of them, right? And they started responding to me. I kept going, I kept jumping from level to level to eventually, I had a list of a couple million people, and I messaged 20 Robbins and guess what? He knew who I was at that point, he responded, it was easier to do a deal. That's how we do the Dream 100. So hopefully that was helpful for me guys, because that's one of the big things people freak out about, I was like, I wanna give my presentation, I wanna get my message out to the world, but how do I actually find the people who could be putting me in front of their audiences? The Dream 100 is the secret to how to do that. All right, without said you guys, I hope you enjoyed this video.
