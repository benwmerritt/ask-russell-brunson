## Transcript
I'm over here ish. And we're going to put it up on IG. What? It's up IG. All right. Um, I think we might be live on Facebook. We are. We are. What's up, Jim? How's it going, man? What's up? I'm a garden gnome today. But it's the perfect. It's the perfect compliment to my blowup unicorn. So I'm wearing my garden gnome hat in case of you because some smarty. But Jim's wearing a dance cap today. Whoa. Easy scooter. And we don't play with those wimpy garden gnomes. This is a man's garden gnome. You see him? He's holding the machine gun and he says, say hello to my love friend. That's a man's garden gnome. That is that is pretty impressive. It would be other garden gnomes are lame. So do you have a name like you know me or Juliet or? No, you know me on Juliet. Yeah, I know who that is, but no. Oh, I don't know. I don't have that. I do. You name Jim garden gnome Jim. Alca Alca Romeo. Al Pacino. Oh, Al Pacino. Al Pacino. Oh, Al Pacino. That is that is amazingly good. Say hello to my little friend. Oh crap. All right. Well, this is you mentioned before we started two weeks in a row. You guys two weeks in a row of funnel Fridays were an episode 60. Then a lot of these, but this is the most consistent. We've been in a little while and what's the most important thing that's happening at ClickFunnels today? Ice cream cake from Jim. That's right. Yeah. Because if you remember last week, we celebrate Jim's hour. What's that hour? It wasn't Jim's. It was ours. Definitely a team effort hour success of funnel flip funnel. Funnel scripts, Russell. Our project together is funnel scripts, Russell. Right here. There it is. We're dabbing. I was racing this morning. My wife said now town. I've had somewhere. It's been a crazy morning. We're just getting started. So it's all good. Got on my business hat. Okay. So here's what we're doing today. This is something that people ask a lot about. Actually, we get, we have a lot of real estate agents that you get. We have real estate agents that use ClickFunnels and funnel scripts to get leads. And so we have somebody that asked basically they, he's a real estate agent in Philly. Do you want me to show my screen? I'll show what he's got. Okay. So he's got a, a, a, a. He's a real estate agent in Philadelphia. Philly. Philadelphia boarded raised. I'm where I spend most of my days. That's right. Um, so. I'm trying to not do the rest of the song. So, um, so basically he's got this and there's some good parts in it, but there's some things that aren't good. And he's trying to develop leads by offering the complete Philly home buying guide. But the immediate thing that pops out to me is this is what it is. Not what it does. So we want to read. Yeah, there's no benefit in it. Um, and then he's got, I think he's got two things. On here to try and get somebody to sign up for something because there's just too much going on. So in my opinion, we need to take this down to a, just a straight up lead generation page. Hmm. Somebody just came out with a book about that recently. I don't know who. Look with many examples. Um, by the way, I don't know what you're talking about, but if you go to leave funnels.com for seven bucks, you can get a free book. I'm not sure if you can get a free book. I'm not sure. I don't know what you're talking about, but if you go to leave funnels.com for seven bucks, you can get 106. Example, leave funnels for, I was going to say for free, but I'm for seven bucks. That's like any a funnel. That's a little more than that. It's like 17 cents per. I don't know the math. That math is amazing. And, um, but I actually have read that book all the way through already and it is fricking amazing and you should have charged 97 bucks for it at a minimum. You really should have charged 97 bucks for that. And I mean that with all sincerity, mainly so I could have made more commission when I sell it as an affiliate, but Hey, what are you going to do? Um, but no, seriously for seven bucks, it's a, it's a no brainer. And I will give a little tease that there are some, some funnel scripts going to come out of that book before the end of the year. Well, not before the end of the year, but definitely before the next funnel hacking life. Are you going to make the kiss test script? Those women's book, you know, I'm talking about, if not, wait for meatballs.com is seven bucks. Yeah. I mean, oh, that's bigger than going through and create. I've already got the scripts and stuff figured out what I'm going to do. Dude, that's amazing. So just, you don't do anything. I'm like, I'm going to make some scripts that way. Russell can't get rid of me. I'm going to make some scripts. Okay. So I just sent you a link to the dude's thing. And my thought was this, that, that really this thing should be. If this guy's trying to get people to sign up, he's trying to get people to see him as an expert. And in my opinion, and I'm cleaning off my whiteboard over here because it's the end of the week and everything's dirty. But my, my thought is that we should. Oh, lookie lookie. What? You took this to a whole other level. That's right. So in my, in my opinion, man, I just ruined it by having a crappy. That's right. Crap marker. But I think he needs basically a hook. He needs a video, which I think you tell me, I think he needs a five minute perfect webinar. And then he needs a call to action. And then he needs a Brunson box down here for what's in this. And then he could put some testimonials and that should be the page. I love it. In my opinion. Okay. So I'm going to work on the page inside of the funnel clicks. And you're what, what, what, what you're going to do. What part are you going to do? You're going to do all of it? Well, it's funny. You should mention that because I have, I took 30 minutes this morning before we got on here and actually made an entire five minute perfect webinar script. And I even recorded it. And uploaded it to YouTube. So that you'll be able to slam that bad boy in there. So. I'm going to, I'm going to send you the link to YouTube. Yeah, I'm starting 15, eight down clock right now. So we're officially started. Okay. Right. So the first thing he needs is a headline. And so in my opinion, we can. Oh, sorry. Yeah. That's saved that for later. That's the cue to grass. And it's four minutes long. So, um, So the, the big thing is we need a really cool hook for the top. So I'm using the, uh, the killer headline scripts inside of funnel scripts. So we're going to do a little bit of a, I'm just going to say that I'm just going to start off with the headline script. So I filled it out. And I'm just looking at the headlines and stuff while you're getting this done. But, you know, at last, how to find the perfect house and philly without making a mistake. That's not bad. Um, What else we got new solute. Oh, a new solution to find the perfect house and philly. How to find the perfect house in Philly without making a mistake. That's not bad What else we got new solution to find the perfect house in Philly See You said how about this I'll show you how to get your dream house at an amazing price In just 60 minutes Oh That's not bad as see so we talk real quick the difference of feature and benefits people understand that because before is Existing page had a feature you just gave us the benefit. Do you want to talk about that so that people understand why that's so important? So basically What what matters is and this is a huge mistake that people make is that when they're when they're talking about anything They talk about what it is instead of what it does and And so nobody cares what it is they only care about what it does and typically what it does revolves around Satisfying a desire or solving a problem and so if we talk I mean what when someone buys a house They're they're not or looking for real estate and not looking for real estate and they're looking for somebody to help them find their dream home at an amazing price and so That's part of what it is now one of the other things that you can do Especially in you know if you read calm secrets Russell talks about traffic temperature, but a Lot of times if you're not sure what the traffic temperature is you can use the one-two punch headline Which is how to benefit without Negative so there's a bunch of these like you know how to find the perfect house in Philly without making a mistake How to find the perfect house in Philly without getting ripped off how to you know again You can hit them with a one-two a lot of times people will just do a negative or just do a positive which can be a problem so I'm gonna say you know at last or How about How about we just do How to get your dream house at an amazing price in 60 minutes without making a mistake, I don't like that Um breaking news. I'll show you how to find the perfect house in Philly with the Philly first-time buyer training. That's not bad And Then you can use modifiers like this is for first-time buyers I'll actually look at see how you can easily find the perfect house in Philly You like that or no, so I was looking at button color stable okay You talking about for the how about oh how about how to find How to get your dream house in Philly at an amazing price? I Like that like that a lot. Okay, so we're gonna go with that and I got a This is called color picker closer. No, it's a free Google Chrome plugin you can pick a color on a page and then you come down here you can match it Now the button matches the little text right there What's the dude's naming it Stephen here doesn't look like me Jessica, but We got to work with what we got. There you go All right, so I'm sending you this How to find your dream house in Philly an amazing price fast And then I would use a sub headline on that like you know amazing training reveals how in less than 60 minutes As a subhead is Um It's a five-up for webinar right over plug in here Right, but we're getting people to sign up for that's the training You know, how about just amazing training reveals how is it free training? Yeah amazing free Reveals how Reveals how every First time buyer in Philly You say Philly Philadelphia, I would say Philadelphia on this one or Philly Philadelphia Yeah That's hard to spell on Q and everyone's watching me. Yeah Some of her Phillies way easier, okay amazing free training reveals how every first time buyer in Philadelphia Can buy their dream house And we're kind of repeating that though aren't we um Let's see, let's see what he's got any benefits here we can rip off How about just can buy with confidence in today's market do that we can buy with confidence in today's market With confidence Yeah It's looking good Okay, so as far as the um as far as the Brunson bullets and stuff Me personally I would just since we use the um We used the five-minute perfect webinar, can we switch can we switch it back over to me for just a second so I can just show Okay, so we used the The five-minute perfect webinar and I filled this out again It took me about 30 minutes and then what that spits out is Is I'll show you come down here after you filled it out click get results and I actually use the two to four minute one And we spit that out as a five-minute webinar two to four minute and a one-minute perfect webinar one to two One to two minute so five minutes is too long for you That's right, so What I would do is just use the seek use the secrets, okay as the for the bullets So I'm gonna give you these the first secret is why location is only one third of the equation And you want me to send you these so you can make it easier, huh? Yeah, fine copy and paste that'd be okay, so I'm gonna stop sharing that but um Okay, so I'm gonna send you the first one. You're gonna have to modify it a little bit Um while you're doing that. I think a really good idea. I want to do what if we did a five-minute perfect webinar workshop in Boise? We hire a bunch of bring up not hire it We invite a bunch of people who are copywriters and want to be copywriters We train them and then give them all of my products and make them each write a perfect webinar for all my products and your product Students and everybody's as the payment for the training we then have like 500 perfect webinars that I can go record as ads Yes, Dave just freaked out. I I I think that's an amazing idea Yes um I Think that's an amazing idea You guys have malls out there, right? Because I gotta figure out a way to entice my wife to want to come to Boise with me How about this let's buy her some stuff We'll hide it in a fake like codonk Idaho mall and like oh, yeah Go to this one all the cool stuff's there and then chill because they have malls, but like, you know The village is nice. She's kidding. Boise is amazing. Yeah, like we're like either Freddie Perry boys She's like she's a tractor picking up the airport. Do they actually have a driver like a thing like No, my wife doesn't unless they have a casino. My wife does not travel She can gamble here We have a lottery Yeah, we do we have a lot of yeah something bad parking my wife at a at a gas station with 100 bucks for scratchers Just does not lead to a happy marriage. I'm just telling you I Give you some icons And then I'm gonna give you one last one. Let me show. Let me show my screen. There's some cool stuff over here Can you see what I'm doing now? I just sent you the fourth one I don't have time. I don't have time stamps on I'm sorry These icons are free inside of the funnel clips. Look at you. You think at this point, I would know how to I would do a money sign for the mortgage one Yeah Don't stink. Oh, yeah Okay, so I'm gonna go you go to search I've been oh Like real estate money Just money I would just do money. Okay. We'll see what real estate money There you go, you still a little, uh, yeah, that'll work. Go ahead Really confident there. Well, no, this is why I'm not allowed to do design Okay, this is negotiations. I'm putting a good negotiation picture in here search Negotiation I used to be better at spelling before um, ooh handshake real or cartoony Uh, uh I don't do cartoons since the other ones are cartoon stick on theme on brand Jim, do you know today I'm gonna be finished with the first draft the traffic seekers book we completely finished today Hey Translows I think the important file. I've never seen I got a sneak peek at much of the content So as bad as I think there's gonna be a right. No, it's gonna be amazing I'm out. It's already got me thinking about scripts It's already got me. Yeah, it's already got me thinking about stuff and there's a couple things in that. I'm like, dang I'm really excited for it. It's um It's been a labor of love. So just see everyone who's listening has context So the the dot-com secrets book was 58,000 words expert secrets was 60,000 right now we are 87,000 words So it's the third bigger than any of my other books and we're still It probably didn't be about 90,000 words, which is crazy All right, somebody's just not throwing that picture there, but Okay, anyway Search Let's do navigate Um, that almost makes me think of a compass or something. Yeah Oh like this compass Come on, is this a boating website? All right, something's messed up. I'm gonna make all of our developers watch me fail alive So, you know to fix this thing that's not working apparently. All right, okay You know what I'm talking about though. I wonder if I save it if it shows up. It's just like a weird error All right, two minutes 41 seconds. Okay. She's gonna just leave people things in there. Um I would almost kill down here though. Yeah, I would too I mean the only other thing I would have would be like I said is play around with testing testimonials and stuff But you know one of the things that I would do again, just because this is all about philadelphia would be to have like a A background picture of something that really showed that this was philadelphia I agree I want to learn how to buy Um, so should I show real quick? Well, let me do one thing. Let me plug in the video So this is the video you made right through demo here since our timer beeps And I'm gonna save this As one of the examples inside of funnel script So when you go into funnel scripts, you'll be able to load this script in the five minute perfect webinar and play with it So I would encourage real estate agents, you know, all you got to do is change philly to wherever you are and There you go. Let me show you guys a quick click for all those tricks. So right now the background is white So Jim said you put like a philly picture back there. She click on settings And it says what do you want the background image to be so you click on there? And then like here's different backgrounds. Ideally be something like philly. So let me see if I can search and find a philly I would put in philadelphia h i l uh You should think she knew I can't spell it. Yeah He just wanted to embarrass me twice on the show. No, I didn't All right, so you find a background ideally if you find like a blurred back. Is that a bridge? Wait, is that philly? That looks like I said it's like camden right across the street from philly. I think that's the philly bridge, right? I don't know All right, we'll think it is You throw that in there and that's all symbolic for like That's all symbolic for building a bridge between where you are now and where you want to be through our amazing real estate services And then look if you put background image first up since blurry, it's not a good one But you know, it's not like it kills some stuff. So it's an integer trick number one. I'm gonna change the background color From white to black that way at least it fades towards the bottom to black instead of thing number two is I need something to make this text pop So I'm going to turn this text white, which is an easy way to do that Oh, that's so loud. Sorry Make it white so pops again Um, and or the other little ninja trick thing you can do Did you take this whole section of this little um this row click here In the background, I can change the background color and I just make this thing like a little bit darker Oh, that was cool. Yeah, it pops. I like that There's a little ninja click funnels trickery for those who Worked due to it and I'm gonna move all of this. I'm gonna add a new section and move all of this row all this Into the next section Wait So let me Can I oh I think I can Can you tell I don't I don't get to build as often as I like to all the all the other guys in the office going to be building now I had to be a ceo They do all the fun stuff. So yes. Yes so much better than any other thing Anyway, you can see how it works, but there you go that page looking pretty sweet come save it I'm gonna preview this puppy and see what it looks like In west philadelphia born and raised It's not Last week so what so what you got to do is unshoot don't share, you know, stop sharing your screen Okay, and then when you go to share your screen again check the box before you Confirm sharing it look for boxes that share audio Here if you're sound, okay Yeah, and then share it and then share the screen now when you play it it should play And it doesn't Let me refresh maybe it's a it played earlier what I what didn't want it to Curse word well That the most important part of the home buying process especially for first time home buyers here in philly is not Location location location So what is the most important part of buying your first home here in the greater philadelphia area? It's finding the right balance of three key factors Negotiation location and financing. Hi. I'm steve bezogany And I am philly's local real estate expert who has helped over 125 local families with their real estate goals So right now i'm going to share with you three secrets about finding the right balance of these three key factors location Negotiation and financing and how you can often find an even more desirable area If you focus on more than just the locations you think you can afford So the first secret is location is only one third of the equation The big idea here is that many if not most first time buyers here in philly only look where they think they can afford to live Not where they dream about living this is important because if you only look where you think you can afford to live You'll miss out on the hidden gems with better upside potential to increase in value over the coming years Not to mention better schools shopping amenities and more the second secret is there's more to negotiation than just offering a lower price The main thing to understand here is that you'd be surprised what an agent with intimate knowledge of the local market can do To negotiate to get you into a neighborhood you might otherwise only dream about this means if you have a great negotiator working for you It opens up a lot more potential neighborhoods houses and opportunities Even if you're on a tight budget the third secret is not all mortgages are created equal the financing You choose is just as important if not more important than the home you choose now This is key to understand because your bank will only offer you the financing they have available and you could miss out on special programs You don't even know about they can massively increase your buying power help you with closing costs lower your down payment and more In short the right financing can often spell the difference between getting your dream home or forcing you to settle for less Now I know what you're thinking It's only the wealthy families with big down payments They get the really nice homes Well, the tricky thing is that most people run off they find a home they fall in love with it They offer full price and then they go take any mortgage they can find because they're scared of losing out on the house That's a huge mistake And so I've created this philly first time by our training so you can use this knowledge to quickly become extremely knowledgeable about our Local market here in philly You'll be better educated than some real estate agents the philly real estate market really is different Many areas claim to be different But philly truly is different with our unique neighborhoods history culture architecture and more in this online class is specifically designed To help first-time buyers just like you here in the local philly market And so what this is going to do is reveal to you how to navigate the world of philly real estate So you end up with the best house in your dream neighborhood with a down payment monthly payment that makes you and your bank account smile When you click the link you can register for free today I honestly don't know how much longer we're going to keep this philly first time by our training available And the price will probably go up because we want to keep our services personalized and give every family the attention they deserve So click the link get it today while it's still available for free We're always here to help and I can't tell you all the amazing results We've gotten for first-time buyers in philly just like you who are struggling with buying their first house here in the unique market of philly Alvia we also have customized home by representation services that don't cost you a dime to utilize But today i'm talking about the philly first time buyer training, which is amazing I can't wait to see you on the inside click the link register now and have a great day Whoo going bad.
