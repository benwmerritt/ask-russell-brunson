Alright, I know that sometimes entrepreneurs, we are out there trying to change the role. We get stuck against roadblocks and things that are hard, there's ups and there's downs. And I think for most of us, a lot of times we turn to quotes to get us excited. And there are four quotes that I found this week that meant a lot to me during times when I was struggling times around. I didn't wanna wake up in the morning or times I wanted to go to the next level. So I'm gonna share with you guys four of my favorite quotes that hopefully will have as big of an impact on you as they had on me. And I recommend watching these over and over. We're gonna tag somebody down below who you know is in the thick of it, who needs some help, who needs that little push over the edge. And I hope these quotes will help you as much as they help me. Theodore O'Rourke said, The only man who never makes mistakes is the man who never does anything. This is such a cool quote. And it reminded me of another one of those quotes, it's even longer, so I'm gonna read it. It says, It's not the critic who counts. It's not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who's actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again because there's no effort without error and shortcoming. But who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows great, the great enthusiasm, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who with the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement. And with the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly. So his place will never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat. So many of you, I know this, I've gone through this as well. You're out there and you're trying and you've got people who want you to fail. People you love who just want you to go back to normal life and they're hoping you, like they don't want you to fall flat on your face, they want you to live a normal life. And as you're trying to do things beyond yourself, they honestly are like, I kind of hope they fail. Or the people who aren't gonna like you, there's your haters who really do. I think when you understand this, this is something that's gotten me through so many times. In fact, man, this is the last of it here where it says that if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly. So his place will never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat. Like for all of us, you guys, as entrepreneurs, we're either recreating, we're trying, we're challenging, we're doing things, we're trying to create, you are gonna fail over and over and over and over and over again and that's okay because you just need the one success. If I could show you guys how many funnels flop before the ClickFunnels funnel, not just the, I mean, we had six variations, the ClickFunnels funnel before it took off. But prior to that, the 100 plus, 120, 130 plus funnels, I did in a dozen different markets. Had a time that didn't work, then you guys understand like, wow, this is okay, it's not a bad thing to fail. It's a gift that we have to be able to fail, to learn, to grow and we keep doing it, then we come who we need to be, to be able to serve the people we've been called to serve. So there you go, the Eudor Roosevelt. This is Dan Gable, he is our Michael Jordan. One thing he says is that gold metals aren't really made of gold, they're made of sweat, determination and a hard to find alloy called guts. I share this one because I think a lot of times, especially in our community, we're looking for the two comma club award, we're looking for two comma club X, we're looking for all these kind of things and I think coming back to this, understand that gold metals are not made of gold, right? They're made of all the stuff you have to put in to earn it. So if you really want to get those, you want the gold metals, you want the records, you want the prize, you want the money, you want the whatever you're driving forces, understand that that's what it's made of, is the blood, sweat, determination. So thank you Dan Gable for being the man and for sharing the quote for today. Vince said, practice does not make perfect, only perfect practice makes perfect. Recently I did a podcast episode kind of ranting on a coaching client who was not doing things right and I kind of, I may have got that person a little offended and I think that sometimes it's hard to be a coach because it's like you tell people what they need to know, even they don't want to hear it, right? In fact, recently I was coaching Myron Golden. Myron is like one of the most coachable people he asked my advice and I gave him my advice and it was completely different than we thought. I said, sorry, no, that's not what you're asking for. He's like, no, that's why I'm paying you. He's like, if I knew what you were gonna tell me, I wouldn't have had to pay you. He's like, I want your different advice, like that's what I'm paying for. And I was wrestling, I used to have a coach who would always harp on this. Like we'd be practicing a move over and over again, he stopped us, he's like, you're doing the wrong. I'm like, I'm doing the move. He's like, no, no, no, he's like, just because you're doing it, if you're practicing it wrong, you're gonna, it's worse than if you didn't do it at all. Cause now you're gonna keep doing it wrong over and over and over and over again and you're gonna practice the wrong thing and you're gonna do it wrong. He's like, if you're not doing it, if you're not practicing perfect, it doesn't make any sense to even practice. And so I want you guys to think about this as you're being coached by people. Like don't take it personally and be like, man, I'm so grateful this person coached me cause I could keep practicing the wrong thing and become really, really good at doing things wrong or I could shift, I could adjust and practice the right thing and become perfect at it. And that way all the practice I'm doing actually helps me as opposed to making me worse. During a lot of times in my life where things have been down and then hard and I've been struggling, I turned to church hill so many times and this is one of my favorite quotes, talking about the war. He said, we have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind, we have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I will say it is to wage war by sea, by land, by air with all of our might, with all of our strength that God has given us. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word, victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be. And I think for all of you guys who are out there who are trying to be successful, you have before you an ordeal of the most grievous kind. It's not gonna be easy. Gave many long months of struggle and suffering. What is your aim? It's victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be. Well, you guys remember that, because sometimes this road is long. And if I could rewind 15 years ago when I started this journey, if I'd have known it would have been this long and windy, I probably wouldn't have gone on it. There were times like I said, when we went through, I had to fire 100 people in a day. There were times when I lost friends, lost family members that were working. Like so much of this stress and the toil and the things he's talking about. But when you look at it, say, look, victory is what we're going for, however long and hard the road may be. That's the goal, that's where we're going. It gives you the foresight you need to keep moving forward. So Winston Churchill, again, one of my favorite quotes of all time, victory, however long and hard the road may be. So those are four of my favorite quotes. I would love if you take five seconds and post your favorite quote that's gotten you through tough times down below so I can read them so the entire community can read them. Anyway, let me know your favorite quote down below and I'll see you on the next video.
