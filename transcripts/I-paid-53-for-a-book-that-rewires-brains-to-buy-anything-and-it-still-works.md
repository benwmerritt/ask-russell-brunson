People buy based on emotion not on logic probably heard this concept before people buy things emotionally and they justify them logically One of my favorite examples of this is my business partner Todd Dickerson He's gonna kill me for telling you guys this story But a couple years ago he went and he wanted to buy a Ferrari now if you ever bought a Ferrari before or driven to one We sit down the very first time you turn the car on there's this feeling It's like noise like rumbles through your body It's like and you feel yourself you imagine yourself driving down the street the wind blowing through your hair Imagine going the gas station people coming to you I know this is actually one a Ferrari one time and literally when you park it at a gas station All the dudes come to you and they start asking you questions. I know nothing about cars like how many horses under that hood I'm like, I don't know you're asking. I don't know you're even talking about right? I remember driving the very first time the most fascinating thing is that none of the women ever noticed like they be driving They didn't even notice but all the dudes like whoa whoa, you know like you get everyone's attention So happens as you sit behind the seat and emotionally like I need this car And so Todd bought the Ferrari and then as he was driving home He's like my wife Ashley is gonna kill me and so he gets home He's like Ashley I bought a new car But the coolest thing about it gets really really good gas mileage the resale values insane We can literally sell it in a year from now the same thing we paid right now That and starts logically trying to convince her about why he bought something emotionally Okay, and so we have to understand this happens in almost every sales argument people always buy emotionally and then they justify things Logically what's up? This is Russell welcome back to my vault today I'm gonna tell you guys about one of my favorite Advertisers of all times very famous guy most people I've never heard of today. His name is Elmer Wheeler He wrote a whole bunch of really good books He's famous for inventing the concept of sell the sizzle not the steak and this is one of his book It's called Sills sizzlemanship new tested selling sentences and again He's got a dozens of really really good books on selling This is the one that I thought was really cool because deep dives deep into like the actual sentences We use which for all this online marketing nerds. We use senses all time. We use headlines We use copy we use a lot of different sentences and this helps you to learn how to sell more sizzle inside of all your senses Which is kind of cool. I got this copy of the book on eBay for a huge screaming deal It's only $53 and 43 cents. I didn't even get a bidding war people didn't know this book exists So I was able to get it for pretty cheap the six core points that Elmer talks about here inside this book I'm gonna break down for you guys They help you to add more sizzle to everything that you are selling a couple years ago I spoke at Grant Cardone's 10x event. You probably heard this story before I said a world record We sold 3,000 our course just over a thousand copies of it and what we did that was really powerful is because think about this People are coming to the event to hear me speak I sell the thing but then they go back home and they their spouse is like you bought what for how much of funnel right and So we created this little packet that went with everybody when they bought it and inside the packet There's a there's a letter said letter to the spouse or significant other and someone would take that letter They open it up inside. It's like hey, I know you're you're significant. I just got home to this event They spent $3,000 and something you probably think they're a little crazy And you're trying to figure out what in the world they blew this money on so I want to make sure you have the same experience So you guys were on the same page And so I made a copy of my presentation right here and I had a QR code that would go and link to the Presentation with their husband or their wife just bought they can go watch it and then logically explain the reason why you're your significant Other bought this is because of boom boom boom We gave a logical ballpoint list of the reasons why this was a good investment and we gave that to the spouse I told everyone when you get home give this to your significant other and you'll take care of all the stress you have because it's gonna help Logically understand why you bought it and then give them the emotional that they need to do to be able to make okay I'm glad you bought this thing so that's step number one So I understand people buy it but through emotion not through logic alright step number two You have to sell the sizzle over the steak and again Elmer is is the person who came up that concept and made it popular Right, so what does that mean the sizzle not the steak? Okay, I think sometimes for me the better way to to understand this a lot of times when people are selling They're selling the process not the destination right the sizzle not the steak so for example Let's say you are selling a trip to Hawaii right you want to talk about the palm trees the luau's the beach The swimming you don't want to talk about all the steps that you do to get there right because getting to Hawaii is a nightmare I know we just went for spring break right you have to get on a plane with a bunch of people You have sitting these little tiny seats the seats don't really decline your back starts seizing up right and then you got to go Through customs where it's really hot outside and then you got to like put your bag through the thing and like there's all these steps Right and people always try to sell that part of the trip right and you never do that when you're selling something you sell the Destination not the process and how to get there right does that make sense? And so that's what the whole selling the sizzle not the steak is right like the steak's not that great You sell the sizzle right to hear the noise you look at good TV commercials right when they're selling me back in the day Like you see a picture like you see a steak It's like alright, but then you add the noise you add the the emotional feelings right you hear the sizzle You hear the butter popping all kind of things like that's how you sell the steak you sell the sizzle not the steak Okay, so that's point number two from the Elmer Wheeler number three use clear simple language Okay, this is one of the mistakes most people make they want to show how smart they are So they use very big words. Okay. I talked about it's an expert secrets book I'm like you have to learn how to speak at like a third or fourth grade level anything above that is too complicated And the problem that most people have especially experts They want to show how smart they are so they will Prolificate on these huge words and their audience they hear them and they feel kind of dumb But they don't want to say anything because they feel dumb. They're not likely to buy from you Okay, and so what you have to do you have to simplify your language in fact, it's interesting during the first Trump presidential campaign with Trump versus Hillary I was writing the expert secrets book and one of the things as I was doing the study I was like you have to write in a very simple language and so we took one of Trump's speeches We took one of Hillary's speeches. We ran through This this software that will show you what grade level the writing was done with which is really fascinating And I think Hillary was speaking at like an eighth grade level and Trump was speaking like a third grade level, right? And like that's the concept you have to numb down your speech So it makes it very simple for people to actually understand okay now sometimes you have to use big words that are confusing So in the expert secrets book I teach about a really powerful tool that we call a kind of like bridge So said if you have to introduce a phrase this that's that's kind of technical or Confusing as soon as you leave the phrase you have to leave you have to follow it with what I call a kind of like bridge So for example, I wrote a video sales letter one time for a company called prove it that sells a product it gets people into Catoce's okay, and when you hear the word catoce's that is not a simple word That's a complicated word right and so and you get a catoce's and then you have ketones and this whole thing And so when I was going through the script I talked about seeing I introduced the concept of ketones and soon as said ketones I stopped I said It's kind of like a million little motivational speakers running through your body getting you energy getting you excited Right because people understand what it would feel like to have a million motivational speakers running through your body They don't understand what ketones are right so took a complicated phrase and I stopped it immediately I did a kind of like bridge. Okay, so Elmer's talking about here is using clear simple language at any time It has to be complicated you immediately stop do a kind of like bridge to simplify it so people understand exactly what you're talking about All right point number four engage the senses and the imagination the best selves people in the world They're not telling you about features and benefits right? They're engaging you emotionally helping you to see a vivid vision of what life would look like after you have this product or the service I remember I think I've shared this before on this channel I remember when I first got in this coachy business 20 years ago I was studying Robert Allen He was the biggest real estate guru in the world at the time right and I remember I got on a tell seminar this tell seminar He spent like an hour long process helping people to create a vivid vision you talk about Imagine your dream home and what does it smell like was it like when you walk through the door like your kids coming to use That a dog it was that look like it I want you to like experience hugging him and was it smell like was it taste like what is the food Taste like and make he tried to create this thing where you're engaging the senses and imagination right and he casted that vision And then from there it's easier to sell because people like they experienced it They just to hear you talk about they actually experienced it And so when you were selling something right is being able to cast that vivid vision so it incorporates people's senses and their imagination Number five point says clothes with confidence and clarity Okay, in any situation the person who has the most confidence and the most certainty always wins Okay, if you're in a negotiation whoever has more confidence and certainty is gonna win the negotiation Okay, if you're speaking in a room whoever's got the most confidence and certainty is gonna win If you are sure about your product your service you want people to actually buy you have to come with confidence You have to come with certainty. Okay, people are looking for certainty I think it was J. Abram once said that people are silently begging to be led right so sometimes they it's like they have a Accord come out of the ability button. They're trying to find somebody to plug into so if you will come with that confidence and that certainty People will plug into you and they will allow you to lead them to where it is that you are trying to take them to and number six Didn't actually come in this book number six is mine because selling is great But one-on-one selling is slow and it does not get you where you want to go quickly So my number six is only sell when you're doing one to many presentation That way you give one presentation and close a ton of people at once It it's the leverage point that lets you grow very very quickly I remember having this realization when I spoke at grants Grand Caron's event, right? There are 9,000 people in the room and I delivered a 90 minute presentation Okay, I thought about I said if I was to go and try to do a one-on-one presentation All 9,000 people we lined up in a row and I was doing like a 90 minute presentation The first person the second and the third I did that and trying to close one person at a time all the way through it Would take like 80 years to close everyone but instead I brought them all together I did one sales presentation to many people and made more money in an hour than most people make an entire year Okay, and that is the power of leverage and so no matter how good your sales techniques are Adding leverage switching from one to one to one to many will be the fastest way to increase your revenue increase your income Even if your conversion rate quote shrinks a little bit moving from one to one to one to many It doesn't matter because you get so many more people through the door that it makes up for everything else The volume is the key this game and going to one to many is how you win the sales game today All right If you want to go deeper with Elmer Wheeler the guy who invented how to sell the sizzle not the steak down in the comments down Below I will give you my book notes from sizzle and ship all you do is click down below Download the notes and give you some of the coolest ideas It'll give you a whole bunch of really cool tested sentences different things And you're gonna follow him up with Elmer Wheeler if you haven't ever heard him before He's one of the greats of all time almost nobody's actually heard of him today And so make sure you get the notes read through this and you'll become a super fan as well with that So thank you so much if you enjoyed this video share with other people and I'll see you guys all in the next video
