## Transcript
I stopped, I remember having this realization. I was like, what are other ways people are selling things that's different? And about that time is when all of the Marvel movies were happening. And I remember sitting there as I was planning the Expert Secrets book launch and watching some show. And on there are all of the characters who were in the movie in Avengers Endgame. And I had this epiphany. I was like, oh my gosh. When Hollywood spends half a billion dollars making a movie, how do they launch it? I'm like, what they do is they go out there. They're getting on all these distribution channels. They're going on TV. They're on The Tonight Show. Good morning, America. They're hitting all the shows to announce themselves and talk about it and promote it. They always show a clip from the movie. It gets everyone on an opening night to go and actually go and buy the movie. Hey, this is Russell. Welcome back to The Vault. I've got some really cool things to share with you guys today from Napoleon Hill, who's one of my favorites of all time. I'm going to be showing you guys an actual unpublished manuscript, manuscripts of a book called The Secrets of Master's Salesmanship. This was a book that was pre-selling a book that he later launched called How to Raise Your Own Salary. This is a signed copy of that book right here, which is kind of fun. But the thing that I'm really excited to show you guys is actually not just the manuscripts and the books, but more specifically how he was promoting this book through these articles, through magazines like this right here, which is called Salesman's Opportunity Magazine. And on the cover, you've got Mr. Napoleon Hill right here. It says, the man who taught millions how to succeed. And this magazine, these articles, were all used to sell his book as it was coming up. And so today we're going to talk about a lot of cool ways you can sell your stuff by following Exacto and Napoleon Hill. They had back in the early 1930s, 1940s. These were all different things I bought at different times. This first one, these manuscripts are actually a gift from Don Green and Napoleon Hill Foundation. It's literally impossible to buy typed stuff from Napoleon Hill. And so I don't know, again, he said to me as the gift, I would say these pretty easily could sell for $10,000 or more. The reason why I kind of geek out on this stuff is, I love seeing, again, not just like the end book or course or products in the sales, but all the things that they're doing to promote it, especially people that are doing it in the early 20s, because they didn't have the internet, all the luxuries we have today on how we sell stuff was not there then. I stopped, I remember having this realization. I was like, what are other ways people are selling things that's different? And about that time is when all of the Marvel movies were happening and Avengers Endgame and all these movies were building on upon each other. And I remember sitting there as I was planning the Expert Secrets book launch and watching some show. And on there are all of the characters who were in the movie in Avengers Endgame. And I was looking at it and I had this epiphany. I was like, oh my gosh, when Hollywood spends a billion dollars on a movie, half a billion dollars making a movie, how do they launch it? And what they do is they go out there and they're putting them, they're getting on all these distribution channels. They're going on TV, they're on the Today Show, The Tonight Show, Good Morning America, they're hitting all the shows to announce themselves and talk about it and promote it. And then they always show a clip from the movie and then it gets everyone on opening night to go and actually go and buy the movie. And I was like, I could do the same thing with my Expert Secrets book. I'm gonna do a talk show circuit. For me, I was like, there's not really, I'm not gonna get on Today Show and probably those shows, but like, let's see equivalent that me as an entrepreneur can do. I start realizing like, I can get on people's podcasts, I can get on people's YouTube channels. And so we sat down and we made a list of like, who are all the dream people that we, if I could have them interview me on their podcasts, or YouTube, their Facebook, and that it would drive a lot of sales, just like they're doing for Marvel when they're trying to launch a movie. And it was all this pre-promotion that drove sales for the book. And so the reason why I geek out about this is, I just think about Napoleon Hill, right? He's writing this book. And if you haven't read How to Raise Your Own Salary, it's very similar to Think and Grow Rich, but Think and Grow Rich was written for an entrepreneur. Like, here's how you use your brain to create new stuff, right? How to raise your own salary was more written specifically for employees of a business, but it's using the exact same 17 principles that he teaches in all these other ones, right? It was showing somebody who's an employee how to use all the laws of success. And so it was really kind of interesting. So he's writing this book, he's putting it out there, and he starts thinking, like, who'd be my dream client? Like, who's the person most likely to wanna buy this book and wanna go to my seminars and everything else he was doing around this concept of how to raise your own salary? Again, Don Green as a gift sends me these manuscripts. He's like, hey, I found this stuff in the archives, let you be interested. And I pulled the very first thing in The Secrets of Master Cellsmanship by Napoleon Hill, author of Think and Grow Rich and How to Raise Your Own Salary and other success books distributed throughout the world. And then it's an article. Basically, chapter one was just this article he wrote talking about how to be successful as a salesperson. It goes through the nine basic motives. He goes through all these different things. And that was the first article. And then there was a second article there, and he had all these different articles about how to become better at selling. And what's interesting is that as I read the articles, every single one of them was talking about one of the laws of success. And at the end of the article, he was like, hey, actually, write about this in my new book called How to Raise Your Own Salary. And he's promoting the book, right? All these chapters of this book that never got published, they were articles he was distributing and sending out to magazines and newsletters in different places. The first time I got these, I was at my house, I was reading them, just seeing like, he's writing this thing. He's also writing in a way to promote, to get people to eventually come deeper into his funnel and buy the actual copy of his book, right? That's what got me so excited a little while later when one of the guys who has self-suff<|ru|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|ja|><|zh|><|zh|> 핫 was through, he sent me a picture, he said, is this something you'd be interested in? First off it's a Napoleon Hill thing. So the answer is yes, but then the title is the title is salesman's opportunity. It's a magazine specifically for salespeople. And when you dive in here, they wrote this right up about him. He's also, he's writing articles in here, talking about how to sell more stuff, and how to be more successful. He's teaching salespeople how to be successful, he's going through everything, and at the end, he goes and pitches his book how to raise a salary. It's fun for me to reverse engineer and see how they marketed books, products, and courses before they had the internet. They're doing similar strategies. You think about when I launched expert secrets, I was trying to get on all these people's shows and platforms. At the same time, I was writing articles. I was writing articles that had people like friends I knew who were posting these articles on their blog, which is very similar to what he was doing here. He had this six-part series about how to become a salesman. He was going to magazines, he was writing articles. Interesting, looking at the way Napoleon Hill teaches and the way he talks anyway, he focused less on the skill set you need to be a salesperson, or the way to present the offer correctly. He spent more time on developing that person as a salesperson. His kind of, the theme of this book was very much like, if you can become a better person, if you have a definite purpose, if you have a good attitude, if you go through all the different laws that Successly teaches in the book and in Think and Grow Rich and these other ones, but applying them to salespeople. If you do these things, you'll become a better person. By doing that, then you'll actually sell more. Most people when they teach sales, they're not teaching personal development. They're not trying to develop the actual salesman. They're trying to give the salesman the trick or the hack or the secret. Whereas Napoleon was like, there's a lot of people who can teach you those things. I'm going to teach you how to become the person that can get sales. The real reality is like, people wouldn't buy from me until, until I became someone who they wanted to buy from. People love to buy stuff. They don't like to be sold. They like to buy stuff. They like to buy stuff from people they like. How do you become the kind of person that's going to get somebody to want to give you money, to want to go and actually buy something from you? So each of these articles are really fascinating because they're going through different ways for you to become better. Again, just chapter one is like nine basic motives, like understanding what motivates you, what motivates the people you're trying to sell. Napoleon talks about success. He talks about a lot of things, but like most sales people have a chance to hear from Napoleon Hill and like how he would develop them as a salesperson. And so what's kind of fun is we worked with Don Green and he gave us the rights to republish this as an actual book, which we republish and give away when people sign up for secrets and success. It's called the secrets master salesmanship and it's the entire manuscript here in one book, which is kind of fun for anyone who wants to actually read this and see how Napoleon Hill can make you become better at learning how to sell. One of the parallels like today, if you think about this, it's like he was looking at who are the people that already have a distribution channel that he can plug content into, right? Because everyone who's got distribution, they're looking for content. And so what he did, he'd write these articles and send them out to trade associations, newsletters, things like that, try to get them to publish them for him. Like he's giving them a good content. He's hoping they're going to publish it out to the world. Napoleon Hill didn't have a ton of money to sell his books. The books were probably selling for a dollar, right? So like you don't have money to go do direct mail campaigns, all these kind of things, right? You have to get free traffic. And the way you get free traffic is you find people who already have a distribution channel and you plug into it. And we found a magazine that already was being shipped out there. So instead of like buying ads, never she could have, you know, you see, there's a lot of ads in here, people are paying for everyone. These ads, he instead got them to write this article about how to succeed that he was able to get inside the newsletter. It has a higher perceived value than the ads, too, because like this is actual content, newsletter. And from there, it promotes and pitches back to the thing he's trying to sell. So that's the way to start thinking about things a little differently. A lot of the strategies he was doing back then offline are all the free ways we get traffic nowadays where you're plugging into other people's traffic and getting traffic for free as opposed to going out and actually buying it. Okay. If you guys want to read some of the stuff from pulling hill, I will do something really cool. I'm going to pull out chapter number one and I will let you guys get this for free. If you click on the description down below, there's a link you can go to and I'll give you guys chapter number one so you can have a chance to actually read through the nine basic motives. Now it supplies back to you as a salesman. Hopefully it'll be beneficial. If you love it, there'll be a link also where you can get the copy of this book, just part of your cover shipping handle and ship it out to you. We can learn more about Napoleon Hill and how his strategy will help you to actually sell more of whatever it is you're trying to sell.
