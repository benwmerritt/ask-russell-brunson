Oh Everyone's gonna be so annoyed that it's back So Melanie tell me why you are driving me. I got lost last time Russell gets lost very easily Typically when we have to go somewhere other than our office I have to drive him because he's gonna get lost and we got a little traffic, but we made it here 801 just in time. Oh, excuse me. What's up? Hey the vlog cameras back Work on slides in here More friends This is miles you ready for this eating bad happens on him Okay, so this is a stage right here this side I'll be able to see everybody's little beautiful faces in the zoom big camera here camera here in the middle Today tell me about your excitement level for today. Oh my gosh. It's off the charts crazy We were just here. Oh man round to round to come to lab round to the man the myth the legend Myron Golden is in the house Haha, you smell fantastic. I'm make it awkward Russell's killing on that stage One is officially finished. How do you guys? No words got to the bench once one stage. I'm on TV. I'm as big as you He started Nice Nice Explain the stress that's happened we figure out some solutions, but basically we're at your comical life And we supposed to be flying tomorrow flight was supposed to be here in Boise at was asleep at seven o'clock Plain asleep Boise by 445 or something on this amazing trip, which I'm really excited for we had to figure out Because of my event doesn't entail 530 tomorrow, so we are figured out work around so I can get on the plane. It's a little crazy, so We're just like We call us the dome Yeah Actually pretty amazing. It's kind of small though, isn't it? These are 50 foot that's 17 foot. 17 up 50 foot a lot Yeah, we kick it off by starting with our run through of our opening You get enamored by all the people and if you saw somebody spending too much time in here You lost the connection so remind yourself because even though it's fun like pick some people out But then right down the pipe again I don't slide this up there and my super super like but if there's something I want to show like Right there Like I said, I know that this This energy for some of you guys is like do I need to be doing this? No, you need to feel it because you're about to go on a ride for the next hour or so get your pens out Get your journals out because you're gonna be riding fast because this guy talks a hundred miles an hour But somehow it's figured out a way to make it so clear that you hear all he has built an entire Company called click phones and the whole focus and the reason it's done so well is because his number one goal is to serve I would love for you to give Russell Brunson the world summit Welcome light it up for him Let's show him how grateful we are that he took the time out of his busy days to come down here and serve you guys Ladies and gentlemen, please get up on your feet put your hands together Yes, even at home and give a big world summit welcome to Russell So all of us right now if you think about your business or your potential business business you're trying to create right I always think like man if I really love my customers like what's the most value I could possibly give somebody Okay, in fact right now inside of our company if someone to do that we usually charge on average one million dollars now This is the most valuable thing I could possibly offer someone but it's also the most expensive now I came up to you like on the street. So we met on the street the very first time I'm like, hey, my name is Russell Brunson. It's so good to meet you. This is the deal I think you need a funnel in your business and if you give me a million dollars up front plus 30% your company I'll build a funnel for you. What do you think you'd say? You'd be like Wait, what you look like you're 11 years old You just asked me for a million dollars like you are insane, right? The problem is because I haven't proven that I have this much value to offer you So we do instead we build what we call a value ladder, okay way value ladder works it starts down here Okay And it moves up and so what happens is that I'm gonna create something that's lower ticket less expensive, right? So for me, it's my books I create a book and they said the book cost 795 the values hot values here But the price is low so it's not that scary, right? They read this they receive value. Okay, we're gonna naturally want more like that Was amazing. What else is Russell have always got a home study course. I'm gonna buy that. Oh, he's got a live event I want to go back. Oh, he's got a mastermind. Oh and all of a sudden this becomes very easy They have to understand your customers will continue to buy from you Okay, they're continue to buy from you until you do one of two things number one you stop selling them things or number two You offend them. That's it Okay, and so something comes into your world if you continue to serve them at the highest level possible They're gonna naturally want more The wife is named Kaleh and Marcy's question is has Kaleh ever tried to convince you to stop and go the traditional route What would you do if you felt the greatest source of resistance to your dreams in your spouse? I've got a couple things I can I can say number one is I Strongly believe you can only be as successful as your spouse or significantly allow you to be You have to have some support of his heart otherwise And my and cluts been amazing through the whole journey But you can ask her hasn't been easy and I think a lot of it was it especially the first few years like You know, there was no results that like I was having success. It was just like I remember one summer It was like two summers in a row. I was trying to build my potato gun and things like that and she'd come home from work supporting me She's like so Did you make it a money today? I'm like, no, she's like you think about getting a job today It's like, you know, and I felt so bad as like is that wanted to be helped support But I think eventually we found a way to communicate better about it where I was like, okay This is the thing I need I'm gonna be working for next like three days and it's gonna be crazy You're not gonna see me but then afterwards I'm gonna come back and have more time or things like that The most important relationship is your is your spouse There's significant other and your kids right and that's more important than business, right? I'm a big believer. There's a quote says no success can compensate for failure in the home And that's number one like that's the most important and if I have to choose between business and home I'm taking home like I'll just shut down the business is not worth it But if there's a way to do it between there's understand like a family still got to come first But how do I how do I structure this in a way where I can I can have success in business, right? That's so important and a way that's not gonna pull away what I need for my fat for my family And so those kind of be my suggestions And let's give it up once again for Russell Bronson We're all leaving show not over but for us But I'm still here You
