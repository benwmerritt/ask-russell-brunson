Hey, my name is Russell Brunson. I'm the author of this brand new book called Traffic Secrets. It shows you how to get traffic into your websites and your funnels. But really quick today, on page 91, a teach this concept called follow up funnels, which is kind of fun. And this is actually the graph from the book right here. You can see there it is. And this shows you not just how to get traffic to your funnels. People always talk about Facebook and YouTube and Instagram. But after you get those people in, how do you follow up with them? We know that the fortune is in the follow up. So the process we take somebody through after they come into our funnels, this is where most of the money is actually made. And recently at a live event, I taught this process in excruciating detail. It was a lot of fun to walk people through what it is, how it works. And so what I want to do, instead of you have to read this book right this very second, I want to show you that video so you can get started get the wheels in your head spinning about how you can build your follow up funnels. And hopefully it'll inspire you to get your free copy of the Traffic Secrets book as well. So with that said though, I'm gonna keep this video walking through how to create your own follow up funnels. People are coming here, they see your ad. And then what's gonna happen is if they, if they engage that they look at it and they click on it and they move down to the next step. But if they don't click on the ad, then it's like, what do we do? Like how do we follow these people? What do we do? And so the first point of data, let me get the smaller markers for this part a second. There's a point for smaller markers. It's for stuff like this, the fine details. So this first step, we have one thing that we're gathering. First point of data that we're getting from people is retargeting, the pixel data. Triple retarget with people. Now if you look at like the timeline of how this works, with retargeting, typically what's gonna happen, if someone sees this ad, there's a lot of different strategies. I'm not gonna go deep into the strategies tonight, but we can brainstorm those, you can think through them. Like for example, one thing, if someone sees your ad, you can do it or they don't watch it, they show it to them again, right? If they don't watch it, show it to them again. Or if they do engage and they watch a certain percentage of it, show them that ad again or show them the next ad. There's a lot of it, if thens, you can kind of make up. And I don't want to go through this right now. I'm gonna give you guys a framework that you can start thinking through these on your own. But with retargeting, this is something like we can message them all the time, right? It's not just like once a week or once a month, like retargeting happens all the time. So if someone comes in here and they don't engage with us yet, I have this whole thing where they've seen the ad, I can start engaging with them, right? And so these are representing days. So every day I can have a new ad, I can change things, I can move things, I can do whatever I want. But these are all each days as you're taking them through this process, right? So that's the first day, second day, third day, fourth day, fifth day, sixth day, seventh day. So it might be like the first two days showing the same ad. As soon as they watch a certain percentage of the movement you've moved in this ad, and you can kind of take them through this sequence, okay? But all we have so far, if they've just seen our ad and they haven't like engaged with it, that's all we have. So we're retargeting and trying to get them to actually engage. As soon as they actually engage, then boom, they move down to the next step of the follow-up funnel, right? We're now at the come to the page. Now a couple things are gonna happen, right? They hit this page, they may give us their email address. If they do, it's awesome, they jump down here, but they don't. It's like what tools do we have? Like what data are we gathering? Now we can start progressing and moving them through the funnel, right? So you come back here, it's like, okay, with this step, we have retargeting now. So we got pixels from this step right here. So retargeting. If they opt in now, what we've grabbed at the stage, we've grabbed their email. And if they put a messenger, then we've gotten a messenger. So now we've got three things, right? And there could be more. Maybe you have a desktop push notification. Maybe like you get out of the things, but let's say in this phase of the funnel now, this point we've got one thing here, we've got three things, retargeting, email, and messenger, right? So they're this phase in the follow-up funnel. So this phase now, again, I can keep doing retargeting and retargeting is awesome because I can just keep showing them new ads every single day and keep that process happening, right? So sequence lets me do as much as often as I want. Okay, then email. If I email every single day, it depends on your market and your business, your business model, but most people probably don't email every single day, right? But maybe you email like three times a week, right? So the sequence that the prod, I'll show you in a second, the psychological sequence stays the same, but the frequency of message delivery is different, right? So email, maybe I can send one every three days, I send down email, okay? Okay, and then messenger, if I get my Facebook Messenger, I don't know about you, but if some message to me on Facebook Messenger every single day gets me super, super annoyed. There's something about the intimacy of that channel, like too often drives me crazy, but I feel like once a week for me about is like this time where I don't feel like I'm too over-aggressive and people aren't unsubscribing that crazy. So the message, the timing sequence is like, maybe they opt in, I got one message here and then maybe over here I got a message and maybe over here I got a message, right? So it's like, I've got some, but they're planned out to kind of further spaced out right here, right? Okay, so now we got this info here. Now a big percentage of people now have dropped through the funnel, they've come down here to the next page or the landing page, and here we get the next level of data, right? So we still get the retargeting, we still get their email, we get their Messenger, now we start picking up some stuff, right? If they're giving us their credit card, maybe we're getting their cell phone, maybe we're getting there to text them, right? Maybe we're getting a cell phone to call them number, maybe we're getting their address, we can send something in the mail, et cetera, et cetera, right? We're gathering more bits of data every single piece along the way, right? Now this is the same thing, the frequency is different for every single channel that we're contacting people through, right? You're probably not gonna send text messages to somebody every single day if you have their cell phone number, right? How many of you got texts from me every single day, they might get a little bit annoyed? How many of you have personally called you every single day that you get super annoyed, right? None of you guys get annoyed? Oh, well, thank you. Try it. How many guys if my cell's guy called you every single day would be a little bit annoyed? Okay, all right, sorry, Robbie, wherever you're at. All right, so again, frequency, like retargeting, I got as many as I can do, right? Doesn't shift down. Email, maybe I'm doing every one, every three days, something like that. Text messages, maybe it's like, face message maybe once every seven days. Cell phone texts, maybe, I'm not gonna do it immediately, but maybe I'm gonna text them like once in the middle of the sequence. And I got phone number, maybe I'm gonna call them, but I'm gonna call them like over here, right? And I have address, maybe I send them something in the mail, I could do that, but I'm not gonna do that every single day, because it's expensive, maybe I do that right here in the process, right? So I'm looking at the frequency of how I attack this problem, right? So every channel has its strengths and weaknesses, right? Typically the channel's like retargeting, no one gets pissed off, they see your ad every single day. Well, sometimes they do. I realize those people are like, if I see your face again, I'm gonna kill you. That happens way too often. Actually, it's funny, what is Ethan at? So Ethan is awesome, we were in Kenya with him and his wife this summer, and super amazing people, and then we got back home, and his wife is not so much into our whole world, I guess she went to one of my pages and clicked on something, and it cracked me up because a week later, she posted one of the comments, it was like, Russell, ever since we got back from Kenya, I see you in every single, my ad's over and over, can you please stop sending me ads? I was like, I'm so sorry, I already offended her that fast. Anyway, hopefully she forgives me, tell her I'm sorry. But from most part, that channel of following people with ads doesn't get people annoyed, right? They're not like, it's not intimate, it's like, oh, I'm gonna use feed anyway, I'm gonna see your ad, there's Russell again, there's Russell again, it doesn't bother them, right? So you can increase the frequency. Email's a little bit different, if I get emails every single day, maybe I have some friends email two to three times a day, I have one friend that emails nine times a day, nine times a day, but he's in the dating market, this is what he told me, this is actually good insight for all of us, right? Like people buy stuff when they're in pain, right? So sometimes you have customers, like I emailed my list and they didn't buy it, it's like, they didn't buy it because they weren't in pain right now. So my friend that emails nine times a day, he is in the dating market. And he says, if you look at like this, the lifespan of my customer, who's a man who is trying to learn how to date girls, he's like, for most of their life, they have a girlfriend, right? And so they subscribe to my email newsletter because they want to hear me tell jokes and be funny and like all those kinds of things, but they're not enough pain, right? He says, what happens, those once or so every single year, something bad's gonna happen, they're gonna fight, they're gonna whatever, he's like, I need to make sure that the second they get in a fight, the very first email they open up, mine's on top. Because at that point they're in pain, they're gonna buy something, and if mine's the first email, they're gonna buy for me. So he justifies sending out 90 emails a day so that the second that person's broken up with, they will buy his thing instantly. And he's made a good business out of it, right? I don't think that's realistic for most of us, but there you go. But email's different intimacy level, right? So you have to kind of find what's your comfort level for you. For me it might be three times a week, something like that, okay? Messenger again, like I said, is different intimacy level, more than once a week I feel really weird. Direct mail, phone calls, text messages, you're kind of thinking through those things, right? What's the frequency of how you can kind of communicate with those things, right? All right, I hope you guys enjoyed that video, now you understand what a follow-up funnel is and how it works. Again, that is just one of the many secrets here inside the Traffic Secrets book.
