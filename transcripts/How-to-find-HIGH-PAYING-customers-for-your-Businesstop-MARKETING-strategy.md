When somebody is looking for something right now, they are hot traffic. Problem though, and this is the biggest problem with search based stuff, is that it's a constant. The man, Russell. The man, Russell. So the biggest thing for the first session is I want you guys to become obsessed with your dream customer and their journey. Like the more obsessed you become with them, the humans you are trying to serve, the easier this game becomes. So I want to talk about the difference between search based and interest based. Okay, so I want you guys to put yourself back in time and think about humans, think about customers, think about these people, right? How did you buy stuff? How did they buy stuff back then? They would sit there and they're like, huh, I need something. And they would go into their car, they'd turn the key, they would drive to the store, they would get to the store and like, oh, that's a toaster. And there's like five toasters and they're like, which one's the cheapest? And they'd grab that one, they'd go to the counter, they'd buy it and they'd go back home. People bought things based on what they actually needed. Now I went back into the archives of marketing and I wanted to see like when things started shifting. 1922 was the very first radio commercial. Radio was free, these radio waves were like, how are we supposed to make money with this? Someone had the great idea to run a radio ad. So it was actually for the Hawthorne Court Apartments in Jackson Heights, Florida. Visit our new apartment homes in Hawthorne Court, Jackson Heights, where you may enjoy community life in a friendly environment. They were interrupted with a message and then they were able to sell out person based on desire like, would you like to live over here? You should come check it out. 1927, amazing thing happened. It's ruined most of us. TV was invented by a dude in Idaho nonetheless. So all good things come from Idaho. The very first TV commercial aired ever. It was for a watch called the Bolvo Watch. The commercial lasted for 10 seconds on NBC. America runs on Bolvo Time. Someone's watching a show and all of a sudden the thing happens, it's like, hey, you should get this watch, it's amazing. And then back to the program. And people are like, what just happened? The very first time that interruption happened through TV. Now fast forward to the internet. Okay, when the internet came out, how did commerce start initially? There was this thing called Google. It's weird how history repeats itself. And for the first 10 years of the internet, people would come to Google, they would search for something and they would go look for it and they would go in and they'd buy it. Now there's positives to search, okay? The positives search is like, when somebody is looking for something right now, they are hot traffic, right? Like if somebody Googled how to get to the Two Karma Club X event today, like they're really excited, they're gonna buy their hot traffic, right? So someone's searching the hot, the problem though, and this is the biggest problem with search based stuff, is that it's a constant price race to the bottom. If you look at the shifts throughout time, it always starts search and then it moves to interruption. So here's my dude over here who's on his cell phone. And all of a sudden he's scrolling through his face, his feet, all of a sudden, boom, he gets this big huge interruption. How many of you guys have seen these in your news feed? Every day of your life, right? You're doing whatever you're doing, you're watching your show, you're scrolling through Facebook, all of a sudden, something jumps out, interrupts you. And if it hooks you right, you stop, you click on a button and then you have a chance to sell you on the perceived value of the thing. Next thing you know, you're in Arizona for an hockey life. Or what do we have, Two Karma Club X, anyway, right? So the pros of this, the big pros of interruption based is number one, you're selling warm traffic, right? I'm able to target people. If we're on Facebook, I'm not just gonna blanket all of Facebook, I'm able to be like, okay, people who listen to Tony Robb and show them this ad, I'm gonna try to interrupt them. People listen to Gary Vaynerchuk, people listen to Duck Dying this year, people like you can target based on interest. So they're warm traffic, you have the ability to go in there and interrupt them. That's a big pro. Number two is you can sell on perceived value. Okay, this is how you're actually able to sell what you sell for what you're actually worth. How many door to door sells, alarm sells people who have in the room. They've done this in the past in your earlier life. Yeah. So if I was gonna Amazon right now and type in alarm system, guess what you see? Tons of things, right? I was looking last night, I was going through it, and I was like, there were alarm systems for my home I could buy for $90. Or $99 was like the one that I found that covers my whole house and like protects me from burglars. Now imagine this, you're sitting at home, you're about to have dinner with your family and all sent outside, you hear this knock on the door. You open the door and there's a smiley person in an orange shirt and they're like, hi, how's it going? Right? They interrupt you and you're like, ah, this person has interrupted me. And then they hook you, they tell you a story, we'll get this later after lunch, hook story, and they make you an offer, right? They come inside and they have an opportunity now to sell you on the perceived value of this alarm system, how it's gonna help you, it's gonna protect your home, protect your kids, do all these things. You have this amazing opportunity now to sell the person based on perceived value, what is your selling, and what happens when that person leaves? You're signing a contract for a free alarm system, but if you look at the actual contract, what did you sign? You sign a contract for over $100,000. With interruption marketing, you have to be good at a couple things. You have to be really good at hooks, stories, and offers. You have to be able to grab some in another face, like, wait, I know you're over here watching that cat videos, but guess what? There's this amazing thing happening, you have to grab them, you tell them a story to engage them, and then you have to be able to do an offer. So the con is you have to learn these skillsets, okay? The goal is for you guys to get in the mindset of your dream customer. Sometimes, someday, Google is gonna shift, Instagram is gonna shift, Facebook is gonna shift, you're like, ah, and then it's going to the next platform, and you're like, okay, they're searching for stuff, what are they searching, what would 12 year old Russell search for? And getting that mindset is how you figure out each of these things. He's getting deep in psychology of the person that you're actually gonna be working with. As a wrestler, a wrestler at BYU for a year, and they cut the wrestling team, they went to Boise State. Every single day I was in study hall with all the other wrestlers, which is a bad idea anyway, because now we're just goofing off, having fun, in study hall, but I remember sitting one day, and I was looking at all the computers in the computer lab, and looking over the shoulder, all the wrestlers, and every single wrestler was on the exact same website. At the time it was the mat.com, we were all on there talking trash about all the matches happening around the world. And I was like, oh my gosh, it's so interesting. Like, if I was selling something to wrestlers, like, where are they hanging out? Like, if I wanted to interrupt them, like, they're all there on that site. I can jump in and interrupt them right there. If you're looking for people who are scrolling, who probably aren't looking for your product right now, but you know if they saw it, they would be like, oh my gosh, this is what I'm looking for. Like, where are those people at? Okay, and this could mean Facebook groups, but it doesn't have to mean Facebook groups. I'd be looking like, what email lists are they on? What podcasts are they listening to? What blogs do they read? What are those different places that are already at that I can interrupt them with one of my ads? Because our job is just to find out where they're getting the information, and then jump out in front and be like, ta-da, I can change your life, right? The two questions you have to understand, better than anybody else if you wanna serve these people. You have to understand, number one, is what are they looking for? If you don't know exactly what they're looking for, you're in big trouble. Talked about this in the Dotcom Secrets book. The opening chapter was called the Secret Formula. You guys remember this? It was like, who is your dream customer? And it's like, where are they at? Number three was then like, what's the bait you're gonna create to grab them? And after that was like, what's the result you're gonna get then? Where are you gonna take them to? Our job as marketers is to create the bait, give them to stop in the middle of their scroll, fix and get them back, oh my gosh, this is amazing. And then after we get them, after we connect it, and then it's like, cool, now we've got them, now let's take them up as value ladder, and it's gonna be the best result we can, right? The more you guys think about that, the better. We'll see you guys next time. Bye.
