## Transcript
Can you hypnotize people to give you money? And before you answer that question, some people think it's immoral or illegal, but this book teaches you exactly how to do that. And before I tell you what the title is, and before I show you what this book is, this is the book that I read almost 20 years ago when I first started learning how to sell online. I was at an event and there was a stage hypnotist who was there, and the night before he did this whole hypnosis show. He had everybody on stage, falling asleep, doing crazy things, and then the next day he actually spoke again, and this time he sold his product at the end of his presentation. And people were running to the back, jumping over the tables, and what's crazy is before he allowed anybody to buy his product, they had to sign a contract stating they were not hypnotized and they were buying this at their own free will in mind. And I remember seeing that, I was like, that's so fascinating. And I started thinking like, can you use hypnosis to become better at sales? Right? And so over the next 10 years of my life, I started buying everything I could find on hypnosis to start understanding it. I bought over 2500 books, and of all the books, all the courses, everything I bought, this was the book that helped me to understand how to use hypnosis to actually sell your products and your services. I took what I learned inside this book, and from there, I actually set a world record speaking on stage, closing one out of nine people and setting a world record for the most sales in the shortest period of time. So what is the name of this book? Do you guys want to see what it is? The book is called Unlimited Selling Power, How to Master Hypnotic Selling Skills. Now for some of you guys, you may be freaking out already, just because I use the word hypnosis, like, I don't want to use hypnosis for selling two quotes on a reef in the beginning of this book that'll help it, that should help this make more sense to you. So the first one right here, it says, scientists who study language patterns have documented that the top salespeople use forms of conversational hypnosis, and that less successful salespeople don't. In addition, scientists have found that the top negotiators use conversational hypnosis as are the best attorneys and the most charismatic ministers and preachers. So people who are really good at sales and persuasion are using this. A lot of times, they don't even know they're using hypnotic language patterns, but the best people in the world are actually using it. And maybe one day, well, how does hypnosis work when you're selling? And in the very first chapter, it says something really cool. It says, when you communicate a message hypnotically, the message is more likely to bypass the listener's conscious mind. The hypnotic message goes more directly to the prospect's subconscious mind. As you know, all selling has to do with subconscious level. And by using hypnotic language, it bypasses the conscious and goes directly to the subconscious. This book has tons of powerful things. But what I'm going to do now is I want to shortcut this for you, because a lot of you guys aren't going to read this book. So I want to pull out the eight most powerful things that I learned from this book and show you how you can use them when you are trying to sell anybody anything online. So that's what I'm going to put on my trusty bookmark. And come over here to the whiteboard. We're going to walk you through the eight principles of, as you can see here, hypnotic selling secrets. So with that said, you guys ready to jump right in? All right. So the very first secret here is what hypnotists call suggestion. What is suggestion? Well, let me read from you from this book. Talk about what suggestion is. If you think about when a hypnotist is trying to hypnotize someone, it could be stage hypnosis or clinical hypnosis. They may say something like this. Your eyelids are getting heavy. You're beginning to feel sleepy. So what the hypnotist is doing is they're suggesting something to the person. They're bypassing the conscious mind, suggesting the subconscious mind. Now how would you use that everyday language? You're talking to someone one-on-one. I might say something like, you're going to love this meal. I'm suggesting to them that they're going to love this meal. How might you use that if you're selling? Here's that. It works here. It says you're going to be very excited about what this computer can do, what this funnel can do, what this software can do. So these are all suggestions I would give somebody if I was speaking on stage or in a webinar or a video sales letter. This is why suggestions work. They work because people get what they think they're going to get out of an experience. They work because thoughts can become self-fulfilling prophecies. If someone thinks they will like something, chances are they're going to like it. If they doubt they're going to like it, then chances are they won't like it. So that's how we do suggestions when using the hypnotic language. Now whenever I think about suggestions, I had a roommate in college named Aaron Holker. I remember he used to do the funniest thing every single time. He would do something to me and he's like, oh, you are so mad. You are so mad. Or he says something like, oh, you are so happy. You are so happy. And I didn't know it at the time. I don't think he knew it either, but he was giving me suggestions. And whenever I'm on stage, I'm speaking to an audience or I'm on a video sales letter. I always think about that the same way that Holker did it to me. I share something like, oh, you're going to be so excited when you see this. When you find out what I'm going to show you guys, it's going to change everything for you. Next five minutes is going to change everything for you. You're going to feel happy. You're going to be more excited. I start using suggestions in my language patterns. So that's the first way that you can use hypnosis when you are speaking is embedding suggestions about how they're going to feel, what they're going to experience. By doing that, you're setting the expectations and the expectations will dictate how they actually feel. Okay. So that's secret number one. You're ready for secret number two? Secret number two is one called idiosensory trance. This one's called truisms and universal statements. That says truisms, universals. So to cube this one, I actually want to share with you guys a video clip from one of my friends, his name is Darren Stevens. He's one of the best hypnotists I've ever seen. I've seen him walk into somebody, touch him, they pass out cold on the ground. We've seen those before, but then he also is one of the best stage presenters and closers I've ever seen. And we had a chance to have him speak at a recent funnel hacking live event. And he talked about a whole bunch of stuff. I'm not going to show you the entire presentation. It's almost an hour long, but there's one clip. It's two minutes long. We talked about truisms and universals that think is going to change everything for you because this is something you can do the very beginning of any presentation you give and helps build rapport with the audience immediately. And then that way, as you're giving your presentation, they're more likely to take your other hypnotic suggestions and more likely to buy from you at the end. So that said, let's watch this really quick clip from Darren on universals and truisms. That's what a universal and truism is. A truism is something that is irrefutably true in the moment. All right? So when you use your language, one of the things I used when I first came out was I said, ah, isn't it fantastic being here in the Hyatt Regency in Dallas? That's a truism because it's undeniable. You're all in the Hyatt Regency and you're in Dallas and you read ClickFunnels. And I said all three of them. So I went truism, truism, truism. And the reason you want that happening in your presentation is because in their head unconsciously they're going, yes, that's correct. Yes, that's true. Yes, that's true. So then if you put in your product or service that you're offering, their unconscious mind's going to go, hmm, yeah, that's true. That's good. All right? So universals and truism. There's a couple of examples. All right? So law of truisms and universals. Because universals are things that anything that is true for the majority of people. So the majority of you would know or heard of Russell Brunson or you're all teenagers once. Most of you have ClickFunnels and if you don't, you should buy it now. All right? So you know, there's some examples anyway. So that's universals. So if you can use universals and truisms in your presentation right at the very start, it's a very fast way to build that rapport. Okay, do you see how it works? In the very beginning of presentation you introduce universals and truisms. That's one of those simple things to start building trust and rapport immediately with the audience and that way as you're persuading them moving forward, they're saying yes, yes, yes, they connect, boom, and now you're able to move forward with them after that. Okay? All right. Ready for secret number three? Secret number three from the book is creating amnesia in your clients. Now why would you want to create amnesia in the clients? Okay? I'm going to share with you from the book exactly what this is. All right. It says, you can trigger hypnotic amnesia by using words such as forget, hard to remember, impossible to remember, not important to remember, or too boring to remember. Okay? What are the things you want your customer to forget about? Right? Are you using, using suggestion to give them something to forget about? So for me, when I'm trying to sell somebody and persuade someone to influence them, one of the things to hold people back is they have this remembrance of times they've tried in the past and they've struggled and they've feared. So I'm going to give suggestions that cause amnesia. I may say something like this. I want you to forget other times in the past and you've tried this and you've failed. Okay? I want you to forget all the struggle, all the heartache. Everything else you've tried in the past hasn't worked. It's not your fault. It's because of something else. It's because of this thing that kept you from being successful. Moving forward from this time forward, I want you to think about how you can be successful because this is a new version of you and you're no longer held back by the thing that was, that was you were struggling with in the past. Okay? So I'm using suggestions, have them forget the things that might be holding them back in the past. Now something guys might, Russell, that's too simple. No one's going to be like, oh, I'm going to forget about the struggles in the past. Okay? So you're not going to be doing that, but my goal with hypnosis is never to speak to you consciously. I'm speaking past your conscious mind to your subconscious mind, which is holding you back right now. As I do that, I'm talking to your subconscious mind and say, Hey, forget about that. This is going to be different. Right? Your subconscious mind say, okay, and it unleashes that so that person can start moving forward with you. That makes sense? You guys getting this? You have number four? Number four is very similar amnesia, but instead, number five, number five is hypernesia. Now hypernesia is kind of like amnesia, but it's the opposite, right? Amnesia, I'm trying to get you to forget something. In hypernesia, I'm trying to get you to think about something. So if I'm doing a webinar or a challenge or a live event and I make somebody an offer, I make the audience an offer, right? What I might say to create hypernesia, they'll say something like this, for all of you guys who just signed up tonight, you're going to go back home knowing that what you did was the correct decision in your life. You're going to fall asleep. I'm feeling good, feeling excited, feeling energized, knowing that tomorrow your new life is going to start. Now for those of you guys who are struggling with the decision and you haven't decided to take action yet, tonight when you go to bed, you're going to lay down there and thinking about what could be possible. You're going to start thinking about what your future could be like if you decided to take action on this. You're going to realize that if you take action on this, like you have complete certainty knowing what you're supposed to do moving forward and you're going to have more success and more happiness. By tomorrow morning, you're going to be ready to take action and run with us all together. Okay? So I insert a hypnotic suggestion like that, creating this hypernesia. Now first, the first time I ever did this, I was like, there's no way this is going to work. I remember doing that. It was a three-day event. I made the offer on day number two. Day number three, everyone came back and the next morning we did what's called the repitch. I gave them one last chance to buy and a whole bunch of people ran back and they bought. What's crazy is after that, we talked to people like, why did you buy, like you didn't buy the night before, why did you buy the next day? They told me like, I sat there and bed all night just thinking about this, realizing this was my future. They literally said back the thing that I had actually said from stage. They didn't consciously remember that's what I had said, but what's crazy about it is that's exactly what they reverberated back to me when we asked them why they signed up the next day. Okay? So hypernesia is a very powerful hypnotic tool that you can use in your language patterns as well. So, that's what I'm talking about. You guys ready to move on to hypnotic song secret number five? All right, here we go. Number five is called age progression. The book says age progression is the hypnotic technique which allows a person to feel as if he is living in the future. Okay? All right, so in this example, the hypnotist is working with a client who wants to lose 30 pounds in the next six months. So this is a conversation they are having. As you're looking at this, notice the conversation back and forth and how the hypnotist is putting this person into the future. Helping them to create a vivid vision of what that could look like. Okay? Can you see yourself in the future? Yes. How much weight have you lost? About 30 pounds. Cool. What were you wearing? I was wearing a new white pants suit. I bought some new clothes. Oh, you had to buy new clothes? Yeah, my old clothes didn't fit and I was tired of those old black outfits. Now, imagine yourself at work. How are people reacting to you? I can see Judy. She is not very friendly. I think she's jealous. She might think I'm going to try to steal her boyfriend. How can you imagine the men in your life? So the hypnotist is doing is helping them see a vision of what their future might look like. So how does that work when you're trying to sell somebody something through a webinar or a challenge live event? It's the exact same thing. I want to create a vivid vision of what that person's future might look like. So I might say something like this. I want you guys to visualize. Imagine after you buy this course. And they say it's three months from now, six months from now. You've gone through the training. You've understood all these things. What would your life look like? For some of you guys, how many of you guys are just in so much debt and it's stressing you out when you get rid of debt? How many of you guys want to get out of debt? How many of you just hope being in debt for you? What would that feel like inside of your life? The same as maybe out of debt, but you're trying to figure out like you have a job and you hate it and you want to get rid of that job. Visualize what it would look like if you had the chance to fire your boss and moving forward like you can work for yourself. You are your own boss. What would that look like? How would that feel for you? Some of you guys already have your own job, but you're struggling and want to grow. What would that look like for you? Like, picture yourself six months from now, nine months from now, when all these problems are solved, you're absolutely certain to get every tons of success. What would that look like for you inside of your life? We start getting to visualize this vivid future of themselves and you're doing this age progression by putting them into the future, helping them feel what that looks like. You bring them back to the future state and they're able to now see the future that you're trying to create with them. It's one of the big things. Some people are really good at seeing the future and a lot of people struggle with that and that's why when you use the hypnotic language to do age progression, you create this vivid vision for them. They want to run towards. Are you guys liking this so far? We move on to secret number six. Let's check out secret number six. Looks like. Here we go. It's time distortion. This one's really cool how this one works. Think about this. Sometimes in your life, you experience something and it goes so fast. You could be enjoying a movie and also when you get in the movie, three hours later, you're over. That was so fast. Other times, you might be sitting in line at a store for 10 minutes and it feels like it went forever. Time is not really real in most people's brains. You have to learn to use time distortion. For example, if you were doing a webinar, for me when I do my webinars, they're usually 90 minutes to two hours long. That may seem long if I'm not careful. Or I do a three day event that's long. Three days, eight hours, that event can feel really, really long if we're not careful. You can use hypnotic suggestion to shrink the time inside people's minds. When I do this at the beginning of the webinar, I might say something like, over the next 90 minutes, we're going to be covering a lot of information and it's going to feel like this is going so fast because it's going to be so exciting. The new things are going to be learning. They're going to be stimulating. It'll help you feel excitement and joy in everything you're doing. The next 90 minutes is going to go insanely fast. I promise you, if you focus, you're going to get a lot of value out of everything we're doing. By embedding that suggestion inside their mind, the event's going to feel short and it's going to feel fast. Same thing if I'm doing a three day event. If I come in the next three days, we're going to cover a little bit of it. It feels heavy. It feels overwhelming. Subconsciously, the mind is like, this is long. Instead, it's like, hey, over the next three days, we're going to be going so fast. Everything we learn is going to be so exciting and new and fun. You're going to feel like everything's pressed down just a couple of hours, even though we're going for three full days. This is going to feel like every single day is we're going deeper and deeper into this. You're going to have more energy, more excitement, more fun. By the time this is over, you're not going to feel drained and exhausted like a typical event. By the time this is done, you're going to feel energized and more excited than you ever knew was even possible. In fact, sometimes you're going to feel overwhelmed and stressed out, but that overwhelming stress is going to turn into energy and excitement as we're going through this because you're going to know that your life is changing from this point forward. You guys ready for some secret number seven? You guys like these so far? If you are, let me know in the comments down below and make sure that this is valuable for you guys because this book is insane. This is just eight of the many things you're going to learn and you have a chance to actually read through it. All right. Number eight is called Future Pacing. All right. Let's go back to the book for some future pace to help you understand exactly what it is. Future pacing. By talking about the undeniable truthful events that will take place in the future, you can build expectation and excitement. Here's an example. He says, in a few minutes, you're going to begin to feel heaviness in your arms and hands and deep feeling of relaxation in your neck and your shoulders. That's how a clinical hypnotist would use it. How do we use it as someone who's using hypnosis for selling? Again, this was the definition initially. It said, by talking about an undeniable truthful events that will take place in the future, you can build expectation and excitement. That's the goal of future pacing. Expectation and excitement. Every time I introduce a new concept to somebody, the site introduces the concept of funnels to you the very first time. My job is to future pace this by giving you expectation and excitement. Now that you understand what a funnel is, you now have everything you need to be successful. You now have exactly need to be able to grow your company online. Before you're probably struggling, now you understand this concept of funnels, it's literally unlock something that's going to change everything for you. The funnels are key to so many people's business success. Now you have that secret knowledge into your head, now you have the ability to use it as well. Again, I'm using suggestions to future pace and give them excitement and expectation about the new concept I just shared with them. You guys ready for number eight? The final one, if you are, here we go. Number eight is you want to use hypnosis to get people into what's called a yes state. This is where we get people to say yes as often as possible. A little while ago I did a YouTube video teaching you guys about trial closes. You remember we were talking about this? Yes? What trial closes are? They're little questions you ask somebody throughout your presentations where you know the answer is going to be yes. I'm going to ask you this question just so you say yes. Does that make sense? I'll ask you a question and I'll say, are you guys getting this? What would life be like if you had this implemented in your system? Would that make life easier for you? I'm saying these little questions like that, like yes, yes, yes. These are trial closes. The more times I can get you to say yes during a presentation, the better. It gets you in this hypnotic movement of saying yes. Yes, yes, over and over and over again. One of my favorite places to use trial closes in a presentation is when I finish my presentation, I'm making my offer. You know when you make an offer, somebody you start stacking here. I mean you get this and this. You start building up the value of the thing you're trying to offer. And eventually you have this big, huge price point. This is the big dollar amount. So if I gave you everything today, the value of it's like $10,000. Let's say the value is $10,000. So that's the first thing. So I'm establishing this is the price thing I'm going to sell. Now before I do the price drop, I don't just price drop, but it's not going to be $10,000. I'm going to give you versus $1,000. Instead of what I want to do is I want to get them to see the value. I want to get them into yes state and have them say yes. This is worth $10,000 at least three times before I drop the price. Now if I've done this right, I've been doing these little yes statements, little trial closes all throughout my presentation and saying yes. I've been saying yes. So by the time I get to the spot where I'm asking for money, they've said yes like 500 times. And then I get the spot right here. I showed them the big price. It's $10,000. But don't worry, I'm not going to charge you guys $10,000 today. But I have a question for you. If all of this did, if all statement, if all this did was helping out this benefit, would it be worth $10,000? Then say yes. Now if all this did was this, would it be worth $10,000? Yes. Now if all this did was this, would it be worth $10,000? So that's three if all statements. If all. They say yes, yes, yes. And then from there, then I drop the price down to the smaller amount. I'm getting them into a yes state. They said 20, 50, 100 yeses throughout the presentation. When I showed them the high ticket price, I get three yeses, yes, yes, yes, no, no. I drop the price. And then from there, then I make the actual offer. So getting people in the yes state is another way to use hypnotic selling inside of what you're doing. All right. So there you guys go. There are the eight different ways you use hypnotic selling secrets. You got suggestion. You got truisms, universals. You got amnesia. You got hypernesia. You got age progression, time distortion, future pacing, and yes states. All right. That's the link. Come over here to the couch. I want to talk about what we learned today and how you guys can use this inside of your selling. Again, when I first learned about hypnosis and selling, first I thought it was crazy. I'm like, there's no way that's real. But I saw somebody do it. I wanted to figure it out. So I started reading all sorts of books. This was the one I found that had the most practical application, eight things that were really powerful that I use every single day when I am selling. It's something I've used so much now. It's just built into my language patterns. I don't really think about it anymore. But when I first got started, I had to think about it. As I was creating presentations, I'm like, okay, how am I using truisms? How am I using universals? How am I getting people into a yes state? Right? How do I create amnesia and hypernesia? I started thinking about those and weaving them into my presentations. Right? And now it's become something that's just built into my language patterns. I do it when I'm not even thinking about it. And you can do the same thing as well as you start practicing it. Okay? Now I showed you guys a really quick clip from Darren Stevens speaking at Funnel Hiking Live, sharing the truisms and universals. But he's taught so many other really powerful, amazing things. And unfortunately, I don't want to post it here in this video because it's about an hour long. But I am going to be putting that on the actual podcast. So if you have a desire to actually watch the rest of this presentation, if you go to any of your favorite podcast apps and search for Selling Online Podcasts with Russell Brunson, you can go and find that episode that'll have everything from Darren teaching you guys even more hypnotic selling secrets, which I think you guys will love as well. This book changed everything for me and it can for you as well. There's also a link in the description down below where you can get a copy of this book. Or if you want to go deep in selling with me, if you go to our SellingOnline.com event, you can learn exactly how to sell from stage, which is a lot of fun as well.
