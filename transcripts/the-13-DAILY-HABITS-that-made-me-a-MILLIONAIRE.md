Hey, on today's video I'm gonna be showing you guys my 13 daily habits I do every single day to help me go from zero to a million, million to 10, and 10 to a billion. Actually, I have no idea what the daily habits of billionaire would be. But these will get you to a million, I know that for sure. In case you're watching this and you're looking at some stranger off the internet, you're like, is this person actually know what he's talking about? The answer is yes. Not only have I done this for myself, we've grown our company called Quick Funnels from zero to over 120,000 paying customers. I'm also the guy who hands out these awards. Yes, we've helped over a thousand people win a two-combo-cup award, meaning they made at least a million dollars inside of a funnel. So, onto the habits. All right, so habit number one, and I know this makes seem a little cliche, but it's reading. So when I got started, I never started a business in the past, but I realized if I was gonna be successful, I needed a shortcut. And the fastest shortcut I could find was reading, finding books, people who'd already done what I wanted to do, and getting their blueprints, their shortcuts as fast as I could. So I started buying every single book I could find, and I would devour it. On top of that, I started reading literally ads. I would read direct sales letters. I'd read newspapers. I read swipe files of how other people advertising their products and their services, so I can learn how to sell my things as well. Reading is to this day one of the most powerful things that I've ever done to shortcut my success and get me to the finish line faster. Number two is actually staying healthy. Now it's funny as I was first growing my business, I was not healthy at that time. I was eating a lot. It was hard for me to concentrate, hard for me to focus. Growing up, I was an athlete. I was a wrestler. I wanted to be healthy, but it took me stopping focusing my business for a little bit to actually get my health back down. I am losing about 25, 30 pounds. And what was crazy is that by doing that, my energy increased. I was able to focus. I was able to work the entire day. Prior to that, I was working two or three hours and I get tired. I eat food. I pass out. I couldn't get things done. I've been doing crazy things to be able to make sure I can increase my energy throughout the day. For example, I built my own personal gym with my own wrestling room, my own weights. That way, I can go and work out every single day and my excuses cut down. Everything with my biohacking equipment. I'm buying all sorts of things from cryo sodas to lasers to a whole bunch of stuff to get every single moment of optimal energy out of my life so I can get more done. Now while it may not seem like something you're going to do right now, it may seem kind of crazy or a little eccentric. I understand that. You still want to get ahead of it today by focusing on increasing your energy through eating, through exercise. And then as you start making more money, you'll go crazier like me. Number three, finding the right mentors. It's interesting. Most people try to go on these paths themselves. They struggle and they try and try on air and a whole bunch of things. For me, I was lucky to find a mentor. My very first mentor was a guy named Mark Joyner who had already done what I wanted to do. He already made millions of dollars. He'd already had success. He was already doing these things. And so because of that, instead of me trying to reinvent the wheel, I just looked at what he was doing and I modeled it because I had a chance to be successful as well. Some people on the other side were focusing on different ways to make money. They were talking about selling things on eBay and doing AdSense ads and things like that. And Mark, as my mentor, told me, you need to focus on building a list. And I was like, no, I want to do these things over here. I was like, no, this is where the money is long-term. It's how you grow something that's sustainable. So I started following the idea and I started focusing on building my list. And now over the last almost 20 years, since he told me that, I've built a list of millions of millions of people. So for me, every time I send an email out to my list, it goes out to millions of people. It makes it very easy to sell products and services to get people to go show up to your events, to buy your books. Like anything you want to do was all for that principle that I learned from Mark. And so for you, the key is finding a mentor and then just putting on blinders, doing whatever they say and modeling them. That way you can be successful as well. All right. Number four, and this may seem actually counterproductive, it is giving away money or volunteering. I learned this lesson earlier on my journey. We actually had a chance to go to Kenya and build schools with a nonprofit. And what was interesting is I was there. I started learning the value and giving. And a couple of things happened. You start giving money away, you start helping and serving other people. Your mind gets bigger. Like you see the impact of what a couple of dollars can do and how it can change someone's life. And the next question is like, how do I make more dollars? Like if I can make more, I can give more. And that's one thing that started opening and expanding my vision. Another thing is one of my mentors early told me the size of the hole that you give from is equivalent to the size of the hole you receive from. Where most people are like, well, when I make money, then I'm going to give. When I make money, then I'm going to share with other people. And you understand that those two things work in hand in hand. Right? So if you want to receive a lot of money, you have to be willing to give a lot of money. When you do that, I don't know how it works at the universe nature, however you want to talk about it. But by giving money, by serving other people, you'll see your ability to receive that money and be able to help more people with dramatically increased. Number five is actually spending time with other millionaires. When I first got started on this journey, somebody said that your income will be the equivalent of your five closest friends. And we're looking around at my friend group and they were all amazing people, but none of them had any money. And I started thinking like, man, my income is not going to be very high. I need to start getting these different friend groups. I didn't know how to do because you can't just walk up to millionaires and be like, hey, I need my friend. So I started joining masterminds and going to seminars and finding out who those people were. And what's interesting is I spent more time with them. It wasn't so much we talked about money, but the way they thought about money was different. The way they thought about life was differently. I was trying to figure out how to make my goal with a million dollars a year. I thought that was such a big thing. And I remember that the guy who I was speaking to was telling me that there would be multiple millions of dollars a month. And at first I was like, wait a month? And I didn't even cross my mind that was possible. And then memory showed me pictures of his lake and showed me pictures of these different crazy things he was doing. And he was only a few years older than me. I sat there. I sat back and I said, you know what? My goal of making a million dollars a year seems so small now where this guy's making millions of dollars a month. Making a million dollars is less about like, here's the tactical thing. It's more about shifting your mindset to be like, oh, like this is actually really easy. And then you can go and just do it. All right. Number six is goal setting and visualization. So I have my entire life. I've always set goals. I was a wrestler growing up and first I want to be a state champ and then an all-American. And those goals drove me every single day and made me work harder than everybody else around because I know what I needed to do to achieve those. The same has been true in business. I remember the very first time that I saw somebody's name is John Reese. He made a million dollars in a day. That became like the four minute mile for me. I was like, if that guy can do it, he can break that, then I can do it as well. It became this driving thing for me. Now the time I was making about a thousand dollars a month online. So it wasn't like I was close to that. It was a huge goal that was way out there. And so I started running in the very first year after making that goal. I think I ended up making about five or six hundred thousand dollars. I missed the goal. The next year I tried again and I think I had eight or nine hundred thousand. The next year, three years in a row, I missed it. And finally after the year, I finally broke it. And then at that point forward, it was like easy. It was like breaking the four minute mile for me. Like I did it. Like it became easier to do it over and over and over again. The reason why I decided to click funds was because so many people actually not only set the goal of the two comic club board, but now over a thousand people actually hit it because they make it so real. Every single year, I see people who take the pictures of people on stage and they photoshop their faces in front of it. We had Dana Derek, she literally took a magic marker in his house and drew one on the wall that way you can see it every single day until you actually earned one and could cover it up with the actual award. So this is the kind of thing we're talking about is making it so real. That's not just like, oh, that'd be nice to do it. But it's like, this is the goal. This is what I'm going to do and moving towards it quickly. Number seven is waking up early. If you want to be a winner, you got to do things different that most people aren't willing to do. One of my favorite stories, it's the Michael Jordan of wrestling. His name is Dan Gable. And when Dan Gable is competing for the 1972 Olympics, he would work out all day long. He worked out seven hours a day and he'd go home at night and he lay in bed and he knew that on the other side of the globe, the Russians were awake and they were training and it drove him so crazy he couldn't sleep at night. He'd get up and he'd start running again because he didn't want to be sleeping while his opponents were training. And the same thing is true in business. Like there are people out there, everyone's going out to the same customers. You're fighting against a whole bunch of people. Like if I'm sleeping and my competitors are out working me, I'm going to lose the customers. I'm not going to be able to serve them. And ultimately, my business isn't going to grow. And so for you, it's got to be the same thing. Wake up a couple hours earlier. Use that time to get the things done you can't do during a normal day when you're at work or when you're juggling a million different things. You wake up every single morning to write just two pages a day in the morning. Over a year, 365 days later, you've actually written two books. That's how powerful it can be is just waking up and putting that extra time. You do need some sleep, but probably not as much as you think. Sleep is overrated. Okay. Number eight. Now this one's not going to sound like typical like millionaire advice. It's not having multiple streams of income for every single person who I coach personally, not only do I not allow them to have multiple businesses, not allowed to have multiple funnels. They focus on one funnel with absolute focus until it passes the million dollar market at that point. Then they can go and they can do another funnel or they can invest in crypto or they can put it in stock markets or real estate, whatever that thing might be. But absolute focus is the key to getting to a million dollars fast. Do not do it through multiple streams of income. Yes, someday when you made a ton of money, invest in multiple different streams. But for right now, you need to have absolute focus on your mission. And that mission should be very simple, very easy. And it's literally just one funnel. If your focus is 40% on your funnel and 60% on Dogecoin or whatever you call it, you're probably going to lose or you might massively win. That's a huge risk and a funnel is not. Number nine is focusing on helping other people succeed. And this is one of the biggest thing that especially new entrepreneurs struggle with is that when they first get started, you start looking at the dollars and accounting, how much money is coming in. The focus becomes on that, on the money and on yourself. But what happens with that is that when you start doing that, your business does not grow, it doesn't expand. The secret, you start looking at your customers and start looking at how can I help them, how can I serve them? When you start doing that, that's the secret. If you ask anybody who's a millionaire, it's a lot of success, especially people who've done like 10 million, 100 million and beyond. The key is not on themselves, it's not on the money they're making. The key is on how can they serve people? How can they solve bigger problems? Entrepreneurs solve problems and the bigger problem you solve, the more money you make. Now for me, when I got started in this business, I knew my customers were, I was trying to serve them any way I could. So if you can focus on your customers, focus on the big problem they have and figure out ways to make it faster, ways to change the process, ways to make their life simpler. You start thinking about things like that, that's when the ideas will start coming. That's when the big breakthroughs will happen. You'll be able to hit that two comic club way faster than any other way possible. All right, number 10 is positivity. Now the secret to this is you've got to become a Mormon like me. We're all happy. Have you ever noticed that? I'm just kidding. Positively though, in all honesty, it is a muscle you have to learn, right? Life and business is never all sunshine and roses, right? There's going to be updates and down days. There's going to be up hours and down hours. Like it's constantly in motion up and down, up and down, right? But on top of that, as you start growing your business, there's going to be teammates, there's going to be employees. And if you're not positive, they're not going to be positive, right? And your customers, they don't see the happiness and enjoyment and what you're doing from you, they're not going to be likely to follow you or buy from me either. So positivity is a huge key because it rises everybody else around you as well. So make sure that you learn how to practice positivity. Anybody can be positive when everything's perfect. The key is learning how to be positive when you don't feel positive. And by doing that, it actually changes your feelings and surprise, you actually start feeling more positive. It's kind of weird. Number 11 is dedicating times throughout the day to just think. Now, I have a superpower. I'm introvert. So I actually enjoy sneaking away from people and being by myself for long periods of time because it gives me the chance to think. Some of my extroverted friends spend so much time talking to they forget about this. So whether you're introverted or extroverted, you have to take time to break away. It could be you sitting in a car and just driving around. Could you be finding a special office somewhere where you can sit with your own thoughts? Because typically the first idea we have is good, but the more we sit on it, start thinking about it, it starts adding layers and gets deeper. You start seeing things at a different level. For me, the biggest insights I have is when I'm writing my books because I'm looking at something at such a deep level. I started connecting dots. I never would have connected in any other situation. And these things will shortcut you so much faster than just doing the first thing you, you know, the first idea that comes you had running with it, spend some time with it, like marinate on it and let that thing grow and to become something really truly amazing. Number 12 is aggressively seeking feedback, especially on the big decisions and ideas you have. Now I do it a small scale inside of my office. Like multiple times out of the day, I'll have an idea or an inspiration or something come to me and I'll bounce it off people in the office to see their ideas or see their impressions or their feelings. Like they excited. They not. But on top of that bigger decisions, like I have my peer network of people that reach out to, I reach out to Dean Grasioci to other friends and I'll ask him, like, here's what I'm thinking. What do you think? What would you do in this situation? Like this is my idea. I want to position a soft right. Would you do that way? Do you have a different idea? I've had sometimes I have an okay idea and by bouncing off of the people's ideas, it develops an amazing idea. What other times I'm okay idea and really quickly find out this is actually a bad idea and I shouldn't pursue it. I can't tell you how much money I've saved, how much time I saved by not pursuing the ones that aren't correct and double it down on the ones that are right. And I find that out by interacting with other people. So don't be afraid to reach out for feedback from peers and other people, you know, it may be, you'd be probably feel nervous at first reaching out to people, we'll be amazed to find out that most of them actually enjoy giving back to you. And so not only does it help them to become better people and produce more and do better things for you, helps you to get better ideas as well. All right. And the last one is lucky number 13. It is mastering your schedule. Now I used to think that I was mastering my schedule. I would start working on a project and next day I knew it'd be 4am and I'd be like, huh, nothing actually got done, right? Or I forget things, right? Misappointments, like all sorts of stuff. So for me, there's a couple layers of this. Number one, I bought a huge calendar. It's in my office that blocks out the big things like when are the big events happening, when are the trips, like what are all the big things happening so I can see like a macro level of my year at a glance. And then inside there, I go into my computer or my phone, I've got Google calendars where I block out my daily schedule, right? Here's my morning routine. Here's the things I do every single morning and every single night and every single lunch that I need to be able to progress myself forward in whatever aspect of my life I'm working on. And then on top of that, the third tier then is all the tasks that I get throughout the day that are very specific to what I'm working on right now. I got to go film this video right here. I got to go meet with this person. I got to do this conference. I got to have this time blocked out to be able to think or to write or whatever things might be. So blocking out that time and then being very, very protective of it, right? I do not share that time with anybody else. If it's blocked out on the calendar, it has been claimed, it's taken. Nobody else can have it. I'm going to be focusing on that in the moment being as present as humanly possible and not worrying about all the other things and all the distractions that are happening. And that way you can actually get your things done by the end of the day instead of spending, you know, weeks at a time going to three or four in the morning hoping and praying you finally get the projects done. So there you go. Those are my 13 daily habits that got me to the million dollar mark. And I think we'll help you get there as well. And then moving forward from this are the habits to get you to the billionaire status. Now I don't know what those are yet. I'm still working on them and developing them. I will report back as soon as I've hit that number and show you what I learned, what changed, what was the same. But for you right now, focus on those 13, follow them, live them. And if you do that, you'll get your goals so much faster. All right. Thank you again for watching. If you got any value from this, please like and subscribe down below. The YouTube algorithm, that way more people can see this and also drop your comment on your number one daily habit. And hopefully I'll be back in about three years from now, showing you guys the data habits that figured out to get me to the billionaire status. One billion dollars. If we figured out, I'll make a new video with the new habits. See you in three years. It's probably, they probably do like daily stem cell therapy. They're probably, I've been most of them masseuses all around. They're always even sized.
