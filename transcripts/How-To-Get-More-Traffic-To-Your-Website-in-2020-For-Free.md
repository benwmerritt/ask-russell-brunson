I'm Flowshift, just tuning in. My name is Russell Brunson. And the question for today is, how do you get free traffic to the website? Because I don't have money to spend on ads, which I totally understand. Now, this is kind of the caveat for all you guys. There's two ways to get traffic. There's paid ads, and then there's free ads. And typically, most of us in business, we have either more time or more money. So if you have more time than money, you should do free ads. Time. If you have more money than time, you should do paid ads. And so if you're getting started, I recommend starting with the time, but always try to move it to money, because the money gives you more leverage. Eventually, you run out of hours of the day. And if you're like me, you've got five amazing kids at home that you don't want to miss them growing up. So that's number one. So how do you get the free ads to come? So really, the way you get free ads, a couple of things you have to understand about how the internet works and how life in general works. So if you look at pre-internet, it used to be really, really hard for people like us who had an idea who wanted to sell something. Let's say I wrote my book, Experts Secrets. I'm like, this book's amazing. I'm going to go sell it. I would go knock on door after door after door. My guess is one out of 500 doors would be like, what are you talking about? I don't want to be an expert. It makes no logical sense. So I'll go to the next door, and it's just really, really hard. But what's interesting, I remember this in high school. So when I grew up in high school, I went to Hillcrest High School. And I was a wrestler. And so what was interesting is that was the click I was in. So here's all of the wrestlers. And we'd hang out at lunch together. We'd talk together. We'd hang out in the hallway, hanging in class. We were like our own little circle. And then there was the gymnast. And then there's the volleyball players. And there's people who played Magic the Gathering. There's all these different groups that group together based on similar beliefs and values and likes and interests. And so back then, though, that's how it worked. So if I wanted to sell something to wrestlers back in the day, I'd have to go to every single high school and be like, where are the wrestlers at? I could go find that group and be like, hey, you guys want to buy it? OK. And then go to the next school. And hey, you guys want to buy it? And keep going school to school to school. But what's cool about the internet, the internet changed everything for entrepreneurs like us who want to sell stuff online. So what happened is it connected all of these. I'm talking about high schools right now, but this is true everywhere. So there's Hillcrest High School. There's Brighton High School. There's Jordan High School, whatever, right? But the group of wrestlers in every single high school was now able to congregate together. And it's not just every wrestler in Boise or in Utah or wherever you live, but it's every single wrestler from all around the world can all congregate together based on similar beliefs and values. So think about this. If you go to Facebook and you go to the big fan page, it's for me if it's wrestling, right? Or it says business or cooking or whatever is your interested in. There's already all the people from around the world who are interested in entrepreneurship or in selling or in cooking or in Jane Austen for crying out loud. Whatever your thing is, they've already self-congregated together online and they're hanging out in Facebook groups. They're hanging out on YouTube channels and on different people's email lists and things like that, okay? And so it's the power of congregations. Now, when you hear the word congregation, I'm curious, like what's the word you get? Most of you guys think of it when you hear the word congregation. Okay, so for me, the word I hear congregation, I think of church, right? And so this is the wrestling congregation. This is the gymnast congregation. There's all these different congregations, right? Think about what congregations you're in, which groups you're already part of. Because I guarantee in your life, you're already in these groups of things that you're passionate about, right? And so you start thinking about that. And I think about churches. Like let's just say there's the Mormon congregation. So all the Mormons are here and then all there's the Semidei Venice and they're all here and then there's the Catholics and there's the Buddhists and the Muslims everyone's congregated together based on some of their beliefs and values, right? So let's just say I was, I found out that every Wednesday or every Sunday at two, all the Mormons are congregating together. And hey, I'm selling a product to Mormons. Like I would come right here, I would find out exactly when the congregation's happening. I would go and I would fish in there. I'd set my hooks, trying to grab people from that congregation, right? St. T. True is wrestling. If I was selling a wrestling product, I find like where are all the places that all the wrestlers are congregating today? And I'm gonna go and try to figure out how do I set up my business where I can go set a hook, try to grab people from that congregation, right? From those groups. And so if you use the same thing, say okay, what is it I'm selling? That's step number one, what am I selling? And then who wears the group of all the people who are gonna buy this? They've already self-congregated together. They're somewhere. They're doing it on Facebook, YouTube, they're reading different blog posts, podcasts, all those kind of things. And then you gotta figure out how do I get in front of those people, okay? Now there's like an ethical awesome way and then there's like an unethical scammy way, okay? So here's the scammy way. I'll do a little frowny face. Scammy way means you come here and you start spamming these things, right? How many of you guys know about the spammers? They're the worst, we all hate them and guess what we don't do? We don't give them money, okay? So don't do that, okay? Then there's like the happy way. The happy way is come into these groups and guess what? Be a servant. Figure out how you can help people, okay? If you're in the wrestling market and all these people are talking about asking wrestling questions, go and answer their questions, become helpful, be in the community, talk about stuff, try to help as much as you can to become an actual expert in that community and then guess what's gonna happen? The more they keep seeing you in there, the more they're like, who is that person? And then come back to your profile, they come back to your pages, they're gonna see your products, your services and you'll start mining people out of these communities and they'll start coming after you. But only if you treat them amazing, okay? So I'm going into a new market and I'm figuring out where's the congregation, how do I serve these people at the highest level and give as much value as I can? When I do that, the people start getting to know my name, they start coming, they start following me, okay? If you come in there and spam, you're in there for five minutes, nobody sees your link, they delete you, they ban your account and if anyone does actually click on your link that person's a spammer and they're never gonna be with you long term. If you wanna grow a company and build relationships with people, it's about finding your communities, going and serving, answering questions, that's how you get free traffic out, okay? If I was gonna go and launch my Experts Seekers book today, I would go and find out where all of the groups of experts, of entrepreneurs, of sales people, of like whoever, I think this message might happen, I would go in those groups, I would never talk about this book. But on my Facebook profile, I probably have a picture of me holding the book, I might have like a link to Russell's business, click here to get a free book. I'd have like things around there. If I was on Instagram, I might have a link in my bio, but then I'd go and I would just serve. I'd find all the questions people are asking that I'm an expert in, I respond to those questions, I would answer them, I'd be helpful without trying to get something in return, I would just go and help and serve and by doing that, people will come to you, it's just how the world works and that's how I start getting free traffic. There's the long winded version of that answer.
