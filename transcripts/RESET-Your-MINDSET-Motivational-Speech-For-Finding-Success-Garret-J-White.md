## Transcript
Let me tell you a story. I found a book in the business section and it was called 30 Days to Grill Marketing by Glenn Livingston. I had actually never studied marketing in my life. Now you heard the story that I had hundreds of employees, yes? And we were running successful businesses and we were running tens of millions of dollars and I had never once considered that I was a marketer. It's 30 days of simple things that you can do day over day over day and for the first time the light bulb goes on. Wait a second. The way you control the game is you control the rain. Being a marketer is the capacity to take a message and place that message into the marketplace, grab people's attention and pull them in a direction. I had never once considered that my skillset should be focused on this idea of mastering marketing because the story I told myself was that I am a businessman. I had never stood up and said I am a marketer. I am going to learn this and I will bleed to make this happen. And it started with a change which was am I a businessman or I'm a marketer? I am a marketer. I wake up and the first thing I ask is how am I going to make it rain? Every day in my businesses, how am I going to make it rain? Not a day goes by, not Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Where I wake up and say how am I going to make it rain because if you can't make it rain your funnel is worth nothing.
