## Transcript
What if I were to tell you that I spent almost a half a million dollars not on a car or a new house or anything like that, but on three paintings? Why would I do that and why is it actually important for you? So I'm gonna jump right in and show you guys why you should care and at the end I got something insanely cool to show you I can't tell you what it is yet. It's right here, but do not miss it. You were gonna freak out Hey, there's Russell welcome back to my vault today I'm pulling out some insanely cool things that I never share with anybody this first time I publicly showed these anywhere I'm gonna show you guys some really rare art that I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on But there's a reason behind it's not just some chaotic or something trying to collect art All these have to do with success with personal development and you having more happiness in your life And so that's why I got these and I'm excited to walk you through everything to start this journey I want to begin with this right here. This is a copy of success magazine. This is the December 1900 issue of success magazine and if you look at the cover, it's beautiful. It's got the three wise men on there It's like it's one of my favorite covers in the entire success magazine collection And so I started some research on this cuz like who painted this like this so beautiful and like just everything about it I found out that the painter the person who actually designed this as a guy named JC Lendekker, this is the book about JC Lendekker and it's interesting. It's inside here. There's pictures of all different art He was mentors Norman Rockwell and you see a lot of like his style from him He did magazine covers for like dozens and dozens of magazines in the early 1900s So he was one of the most famous artists at the time and so you can see his work if you if you Google him You can see his work on like thousands of payment Maybe exaggerating hundreds and hundreds of different magazine covers and his style is just it's some of the coolest stuff in the world But why I love it is because he actually worked with success magazine on a lot of different prints And this one is really cool because the way that they would do prints back in the day is they would go and like Lendekker or somebody would go to the magazine and they pitch them like hey I want to do a cover maybe they would try to hire him or whatever it might be And so the first thing he would do is he would go and he'd actually paint a version of like here's the idea Here's the concept I want to do and so it's crazy is this is actually the original painting that Lendekker Did that eventually became the December 1900 success magazine cover? Okay, and so to put this in perspective this magazine by the way So rare I've only had this only one known copy on the planet It cost me $50,000 to buy this that was the cost of this magazine and then this painting here again It's the original painting I had to go to a Lendekker auction and fight to get this and it cost me $125,000 to get this but it meant a lot to me because again this was the magazine cover and this is the actual This is like what the artist would pitch to success magazine and then they get the commission like yes You are the one who can do this and they go back and they would go and paint the actual one that became the magazine And so it's cool about this you can see a lot of the elements He was trying to figure out here You see like the different wise men you see baby Jesus or you see different versions of the hands like the hands praying this way or hands Praying this way a lot of the other ones of the auction I saw I found other magazine covers You see you always have like different versions like different ways to swatches here like I do this way or maybe I do swatches This became kind of like you know the the rough draft you might say it would have taken that to success showed it to them And then got the commission and from there went and actually painted the actual design the actual magazine cover Which they would be printed obviously and print you know hundred thousand copies or whatever it was for this issue It's cool about this success magazine. They liked it so much. They actually reprinted this cover again a couple decades later So Christmas 1919 they reuse this one so I don't know if this is after a Lendekker passed away and they were able to because the royalties Or they just reran it. I don't know exactly the story behind it. I wish I did it's kind of cool That they reran it 19 years later the same design. This is kind of a cool thing But again, I went to a Lendekker auction. I was buying a bunch of things I actually got three paintings from paintings he designed that eventually ended up becoming the covers of success magazines That's what I want to show you so this is the very first one again I spent 125,000 dollars on this art piece in the future He is having a chance to come to the museum that I'm building the Atlas research center You have to see this framed on the wall next to this cover will be framed as well And it's kind of a cool thing for you guys to see and be actually like I know the story behind that painting So that's Lendekker number one. Here's the next painting. I'm gonna show you so this is actually a painting He did called the elegant couple. He painted this in 1895 So this actually before success magazine actually became a thing but these were characters He was working with which is really fascinating That's the painting of it and then fast forward to the April 1903 He then got the commission to paint the elegant couple in different ways So this is another version of the elegant couple here You can see like a lot of designs to use like the ruffles and the dress and things like that You tell you've been trying different versions and variations different settings of these people And this is the one that ended becoming the April 1903 issue of success magazine So there's the elegant couple on the cover. All right, and then the last actually this is the second to last cover I want to show you guys. This is called apple picking. I got this one at the auction for 75,000 dollars Which is exciting. There's a bidding war Nobody else knew the real value of which is the fact that is it also became the October 1908 cover of success magazine And so this one's cool because it's like you can tell it's a direct, you know exact copy of it It's interesting too because you watch the watch the prototype or the first draft of it You know like it's missing like you don't see the basket there You don't see her hands not finalized and stuff and so but still it was enough to show and then go back to a success Make this one designed like yes, you get the commission and then boom We went and created this one so this been fun for me because I'm not I'm not an art collector by By default, but I am a collector of books and magazines and for me like I love the story of success magazine It's like one of my favorite stories ever someday I will own the company and it'll it'll be my magazine But until then I just I love the history behind it and like every era you'd look at like when Orson Swetmarin Started like the designs of the covers and you see like it would shift after two years shifted a new design And so there was this window of time where this was like this was what art was back in the early late 1800s early 1900s Because this style like Norman Rockwell look at all the paintings he was doing whether there's beautiful paintings JC Lendecker like you start seeing him doing very similar styles and like this became what art looked like back then and so I just Imagine myself of a new stand seeing this and like again, maybe this doesn't connect for me right now I got one big oh What's this person picking the apple orchard but back then it was like that was what success what freedom like things look like for them And so it was encapsulated by these by these magazine covers and these paintings and so for me It just it's fun for me to collect these things and just kind of see the history and how they how they were part of this early New thought movement the beginnings of success in the country the people that were involved in that you know Someone as me someone who we create books and we design magazines and newsletters like we're producing stuff all the time And I'm always like what's the visual aesthetics that we're creating like to give some of the emotion that we need for them to buy something Right over here It's just fun to say this is the stuff that got people to buy things off the new stands in the early 1900s So it's really fun I kind of hinted that I was showing you guys these paintings to show you guys three success magazine covers But there's one more I want to show you the one I most excited for unfortunately JC Lendecker did not paint this one I wish he would have been really really cool. Maybe in the future We bring him back from the dead or whatever maybe AI Lendecker Version but what's cool about this is if you look at the December 1900 issue was it was a three wise men Which you saw the painting and you see in the original copy if you fast forward from from December 1900 to December 2025 what's that 125 years later?
