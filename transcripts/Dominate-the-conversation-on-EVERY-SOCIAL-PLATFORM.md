Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to the Marketing Secrets. Today's show is about conversation domination. So there was a guy named Howie Schwartz when I first got started who was big online and he had a course called Conversation Domination and it was about getting in Google and like you had to say type your name into Google like all 10 spots would be you. Like you would dominate the conversation, right? You open up any platform that I'm dominating conversation. Like I am in your podcast feed, I am in your YouTube feed, I'm in your blog, RSS, like, yeah, I want to dominate the conversation every single platform. I think I know now why. Like I always wondered why nobody else is doing this. Outside of Gary Vaynerchuk in our market, right? My business was built off email, right? So we built a big email list. You know, we've had over a million entrepreneurs who've been on that list. I assumed like, okay, I'm gonna launch an Instagram, I'll send an email and also I'll have a million people on Instagram. And I'm gonna go to my blog, I'll push up there, I have a million people on my blog and like, but the reality that I found is it's not true. I think about this for yourself. Like how do you like to consume content? What's your platform? Cause everyone's got one or two that's their favorites. Like, do you like reading blogs? Maybe you're a blog reader. Or do you like listening to podcasts? Maybe you're a podcast person. Okay, or do you like watching videos? You go to YouTube or do you check your email? Like, what's your platform of choice? And I thought that everyone was on every platform, but I don't think that's the case. There's a small percentage that are. But even now, if we take our Facebook list and we run next to our email list and look at those side by side, our Facebook and email list, like the crossover in the middle is shockingly small. We have to realize that people that read blogs, like to read blogs, people listen to podcasts, like listen to podcasts. That makes sense. Like people that watch YouTube videos are like watching YouTube videos. Think about this, like if I want people to read my blog, I don't need to go become really good at Facebook ads to get people to read my blog. You can, there's crossover, but if I want to launch my blog and get successful, who are the other people that have successful blogs that my people are already reading? Or my dream clients are already reading? So I need to find those people and get them, pay them or partner with them or whatever, get them to write a blog article about me because blog people like to read blogs, right? So if I'm reading a blog and I read a blog about somebody and I go to their blog, like someone's blog needs to promote my blog. Someone's podcast needs to promote my podcast. Somebody's YouTube channel needs to promote my YouTube channel. If you hear me on podcasts, you'll notice here, you don't know me, I do podcast people like, so where can people get to know more about you Russell? I'm like, oh, go to RussellBrunson.com and there's a bunch of stuff there. But I know, if I'm on a podcast, I'm like, hey, you like listening to podcasts, go to markviewsiccurs.com. There's my podcast, you subscribe, it's awesome. Because podcast people listen to podcasts. Understanding that. And again, there will be a little bit of crossover, but the majority of your blog readers will come from other blogs because blog readers read blogs. The majority of YouTube subscribers come from other YouTube channels because YouTube people watch YouTube. I never watched YouTube video up until three months ago, when we launched our YouTube channel, to be completely honest. I didn't understand, it was so foreign to me. I get there, now I'm in this world, I'm like, look how there's a lot of cool stuff happening here. And people that like YouTube, like they're on YouTube all day long, all the time. People who are on Facebook or all the, you wanna have conversation domination, the key to that is the Dream 100. Going back, Dream 100 people, and then getting people who are bloggers to read your blog, getting people who are podcast listeners to listen to your podcasts, and so on and so forth across all the platforms. Thank you so much for watching. Every single week we publish new secrets just like this, so make sure you subscribe so you don't miss any of them, and I will see you on the next video.
