All right. Okay. Always good to spend time with you. You've done my last two conferences Done a great job there one out of nine people purchased his product made a bunch of money at the last one, huh? So look man, I don't really understand the whole funnel thing I know a lot of people doing well with it, right? What I want to know though, can anybody do a funnel? Oh, yeah, that's nice. He's like Prior to the funnels nobody can do super hard. We miss anybody can yeah from anywhere anyhow anytime So what I want to know is could you do it from 40,000 feet? Could we do it on the way to Chicago? We got a two-hour flight We've been an access here Do I have internet access? Yes, I got three internet accesses. I got two internet fans. I got a K-Bam We could add to it, but I don't think we want to light that one up This is like time crunch. You got to build a funnel before we land if you can't do it for me You can't do it for anyone. I'm the easiest kind of world sell people either love me or they hate me But at least they'll look at the funnel. I'm gonna put I'm gonna put click funnels to the desk You got your boys on board your cost of this flight no free peanuts is You got to create a funnel for the 10x rule. Okay, so I'm gonna give you an easy book Your guys tell me what you need for me. I got internet. Can you guys do it? Can you guys create a funnel? We got two hours. We got a film. We got a film you then sell the book. So my whole life I've been told I couldn't have the dream life I've been told from the get-go was impossible Today I'm sitting in a plane with my name on it. You can't fake a jet Okay, you just can't fake that just take care of the shipping. Is that the bitch? That's it But you guys have an hour and 48 minutes. We're 41,000 feet. No pressure at all man You're running out of time. No tick tock tick tock click funnels. Let's roll You train Grant. How do you expect that's the question? He can drag and drop than anybody can do it What what does a person need to create a funnel so things you create funnel What do you have a good product to you have somebody who could actually pitch the product? Yeah, because it sells funnels not if you didn't just sell the product by itself It still takes somebody. Yeah, and then we need funnel. That's it Yeah, that's awesome. You can grab things and like pulling and move them every business. He's a funnel It's just bitchering like if you were to walk up somebody on the street and try to sell them a product I won't be your hook would be the first thing you approach them with Same thing with the phone like somebody comes to funnel. How am I gonna approach them? Yeah, you're not really trying to sell me by you're trying to hook into interest to say raise my hand and say I got an issue with my car or my root. Yeah, it's doing good You cross that page Quick price the first page grants this building is to sell the book now We're moving on to page number two in the funnel So the second page after about the book then we'll be talking about the actual 10x experience get a ticket to growth con 3 Hey, thank you so much for ordering the book. It's on its way as I speak and I don't want you just to read the book That's gonna be awesome for you, but I want you to become part of the 10x movement Pretty easy man We make it sales yet All right, so now if they say no to that then it takes them to the downsell page This is where maybe they couldn't come to the event. Yeah So it's double down so just the recording so I'm gonna sell on that So look you're passing on the event could be two or three different reasons you don't like to travel You don't like to leave home. You don't have the time what I do want to do However, even if you can't be at the vent is I want to catch you up in the comfort of your home I'm gonna give you a recording almost 10 hours of content to last year's event so that you get caught up Like that that you're right here on this page Use funnels to build lists of customers potential customers. Do you help people build build a hook? Yeah, we love our trading stuff shows that like how to find the right That's the easiest thing I've ever done actually I'm getting rid of everybody mom The funnel is just one-on-one selling without you there just pull yourself out right and then the last page We just think them for their order and then Tell them invest in card on capital So that'd be the last page of funnel and then that's it then you go to card on capital as well before you go one last thing All right, the number one question people ask me when they're working with me is how do I get to that first seven figures? How do I get to that first two comma club? No, man, if you wanted us to build a funnel I like you can do it. It's not easy. Yeah. Yeah I said hey you guys build it at 50,000 and they're like How about you build it? Which means by the way you guys can do it too cut and copy like It's there. So he's already got a template that works, you know, it's like your mom's recipe. You don't really need to change anything It makes the guy that's not good on it with a computer pretty easy to do it anywhere man If I can do it up here you guys can do it down there To get you up here Quite a point. Yeah, let's do it I'm legitimately flying the plane right now I Alright we're flying into Chicago get that It's been an insanely cool trip we built funnel grant built his very first funnel all by himself Anyway, come soon to a funnel near you All right So the last 24 hours have been insane on the plane grant build this very first funnel ever all by himself Which was really really cool to see it's funny because he's like I don't want to do it Then we made him do it. He's like this is really easy. This is really easy He saw easy click-frozen was which really exciting to actually have him use it now We're back here Chicago Air Airport. We're here 24 hours ago. So 24 hours We've been on not one but two private planes and had a whole bunch of fun So the moral of this episode is you should try to get your own plane Best kidding kind of but really for me. It's all about like leveling up You know last episode we were in San Francisco at Salesforce and watched how a Multi-billion dollar company runs how it looks like the strategy behind it Here we saw prove it, you know, they're a half a billion dollar your company now It started like three and a half years ago and then you look at well grants I have no idea how much his revenues are but enough to write a check for a $50 million plane every time I feel like I'm like thinking big I find the next level and I realize I'm thinking small I know the difference between success more we want to be where we could be is all between our ears It's all just what we believe and so if you see people do things are more likely to believe it's true I have absolute belief now that it's possible for click phones go from a hundred million to a billion and a billion to ten Whereas before I just hope belief is the key for this episode I look for your future what you want to do accomplish find people who've already done it when you see them You'll rise you can do as well and that belief is a little driving forward. So that's it for this episode. Thanks so much See you on the next episode of Funalhacker TV You
