Do not spend money on Brandy, okay? If I put a dollar in, what happens at dollar? If I don't know what's happening to it, you do not spend the dollar. 12 year old Russell started freaking out because I was like, this is the greatest thing in the world. I want to share with you guys a lesson I learned from Dan Kennedy. I literally spent $100,000 learning from him, yet he put it inside of this book for 10 bucks, and I'm about to show you here inside the video for free. So Dan Kennedy is my mentor. He is literally known as the godfather of direct response marketing. Almost everybody who's learned marketing originally came from the man, the myth, the legend, himself, Dan Kennedy. And Dan Kennedy decided to book No BS Direct Marketing, the ultimate, no holds barred kick butt, take no prisoners of direct marketing for non-direct marketing businesses. Hoo, book inside here he has what's called No BS 10 Commandments of Marketing. And what's cool about this is he goes through each of these 10 commandments, and every single one of them are things that traditional businesses break. A lot of influencers, a lot of social media people, they're breaking two, three, four of these commandments, and when you follow them strictly, and you look like, and act like these are like literally the 10 commandments, you don't follow them, this is when you see your business explode. Again, I spent over $100,000 to learn this direct from Dan Kennedy, and you guys have a chance to learn right now, because recently at one of the Dan Kennedy events, I had a chance to speak at, I asked Dan if I could actually share the 10 commandments from this book with the audience, and luckily for me and for you, he said yes. And today I want to actually show you guys this presentation. So what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to jump into this clip and show you guys the 10 Commandments of Direct Response Marketing. Did you see what I'm saying here? Rule number one, there should always be an offer or offers. Okay, subtitle there says, make every communication actually ask somebody to do something, ideally an offer that the appropriate prospect or customer cannot refuse, okay? So this is the first thing to understand, there always has to be an offer or offers. Most people who start a business, they have a product. They have a product or a service or something, but it's a product, it's a commodity, right? What happens when we have a commodity? The biggest problem with a commodity, let's say you say a chiropractor, and I do adjustments, and there's 25 people down to, in Boise down this street right here who are chiropractors, who all do adjustments, right? So you have a commodity, everyone has the same product, right? What happens when everyone's got the same product? All of a sudden, everyone starts, well, I also do adjustments, I do, I do, I do, and everyone says the same thing, it's like, well, I do it for a little bit cheaper. Well, I do it for a little cheaper. And all of a sudden, everyone's fighting over price, and the price gets lower and lower and lower and lower, so eventually, what you're selling doesn't, they're not making any money from it, right? Because when you have a commodity, the person with the lowest price actually wins. Now, one other thing Dan Kennedy taught me, he's not one of the 10 commandments here, but he said, if you can't be the lowest price leader in town, if you can't be Walmart, there's no strategic advantage of being the second lowest price leader in town, right? But there is a huge strategic advantage about being the most expensive, okay? So the rule number one here is about making offers. Now, what offers, you're taking a product that's a commodity that everyone else has, and you're adding other things to it to make it unique, to make it special, where you're the only person on the planet who has the ability to actually sell that thing, right? Now it's an offer, and now there's not a race at the bottom, because I'm the only person on the planet that can sell Dan Kennedy's products and courses, right? I'm the only person that can sell ClickFunnels, so it becomes unique, it becomes an offer that only you have, right? Now, a lot of times we don't know what offer's gonna work, and so that's why it's so important, like it says here, there should always be an offer, offers. You need to be putting out a lot of offers into the marketplace, okay? That's one of the keys of Direct Funds Market, I put out an offer, right? And try another offer, you're testing different things to figure out which offer's gonna work, okay? You're like, oh, this offer works good, oh, this offer works really good, and so you keep putting different offers out there into the marketplace, okay? So that's rule number one, there should always be an offer or offers. And number two, there should always be a reason for somebody to respond now. So when the keys of Direct Funds Market, in your marketing, your messaging, your sales letters, your funnels, anything else, there's gotta be a reason for people to respond now, okay? What that means is there's gotta be urgency and scarcity, a reason why they gotta do it today, okay? When I was a young kid, I was thinking I was 12 or 13 years old, I saw my very first infomercial, it was Don LaPri, talking about how to make money with tiny classified ads, and it wasn't just infomercial, he talked about singing, I'm like, oh, cool, that's a good idea. He did the thing, he made an offer, which is rule number one, and they said, this offer expires when the infomercial ends, okay? Now 12 year old Russell started freaking out because I was like, this is the greatest thing in the world. I got a pad of paper out down the phone number, I was like, I got a call, I'm like, dad, I need your credit card, this offer's about to disappear. My dad's like, no, you're not buying this, I'm like, dad, you're out, I'm freaking out, and I missed the thing, the infomercial ends, I'm like, ah, it's over, I lost everything, right? But then I was like, I need to, I want that, so I had this desire, he made an offer that was irresistible, I had this desire, and so I started earning the money, I saved the money, and then I would stay at a late night with my dad, night after night after night, waiting for the infomercial to come back, and as soon as the infomercial came back on, and I had this opportunity to buy, I remember I got on the phone, got my dad's credit card, called, and I ordered, okay? Because the reason for me to respond right then. Now if I said, there's an offer, it's available forever, what is, we're never gonna buy it. So what I have to do is I have to give you a reason to respond now, which means we have to take this away, which means when this challenge over, that offer disappears, okay? If I don't take it away from you guys, you're like, oh, well, next week I'll try it, or next month I'll try it, oh, when I'm ready, it's this thing we call the Mannyana principle, like, oh, Mannyana, tomorrow I'll do it, tomorrow, that's your prospect you're saying, over and over and over again, okay, and if they try to do it tomorrow, guess what? They're never gonna do it, because Mannyana never comes, tomorrow never comes, okay? So if you're a prospect, if you don't take things away from them, they won't do it. The biggest thing you can do to help push somebody to take the step they needed to take to be successful is so you have to make these things disappear, like you have to give them a reason to respond right now. Number three, there should always be clear instructions on how to respond, okay? The worst things in the world, you drive down the street, you see a big billboard, it's like free TV for life, if you, you see a big ad with a good offer, you're like, oh, it's amazing, how do I respond? You're like, I don't know, you drive very fast, right? Or you see 99.999% of all TV commercials, they have a funny thing, something cool, they show you the product, that's amazing, and then it goes next commercial, you're like, ah, I don't know what to do, like, ah, right? In direct response, you always give them clear instructions on how to respond, okay? If you ever watched me do one of my webinars, I don't just like, if you're interested, go to the website, I'm like, open up a brand new browser at the top of your type in www.magneticmarketing.com, forward slash go, when you do that, it's gonna take you to a page right here. When you see that page, the first thing you do is you put in the credit card, and I tell them exactly what to do, okay? Literally, we put these videos in some of our order forms, and the video was like, hey, welcome to the order form, the first thing you need to do right now is fill out the form down below. First you can put your name, then your email address, then your shipping address, and then put your credit card in, and then you click submit button. That dorky little video, we're telling them how to actually fill out the form, dramatically increase conversions on the actual form, okay? You're like, well, they're in order form, they should know what to do. Yeah, but this is the rule. They should always be clear instructions on how to respond, you tell them exactly what to do. Everyone, all your advertising, your Facebook posts, your social media, everything you're doing, your radio ads, TV ads, you have to tell them how to respond, and tell them that part like 10,000 times, right? The good radio ad is one that makes the offer and says, right now, pick up your phone and dial dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. Once again, pick up the phone and dah, dah, dah, dah. Three more times, and it's telling you exactly what to do over and over and over and over again, okay? That's rule number three. Rule number four, there should always be tracking and measurement, okay? You have to be able to track what you're doing. I remember it, man, probably my second or my third Dan Kennedy event I ever went to, a guy named, I think it was Lenny Lieberman, who was running Proactive at the time. I don't know if he still does or not, but he spoke, and I remember he talked about it, he said, Proactive has never spent a dollar on advertising, they couldn't track its ROI. It's like it's been hard for us, we had so many amazing opportunities, people who wanted to put us on the Super Bowl or do these big TV campaigns, all sorts of stuff, because we set a rule from day number one that if you cannot track the dollar we spend, we will not spend that dollar. I need to know if I put a dollar into this Facebook ad, or this Instagram, or TikTok, or YouTube, or direct mail, or phone, whatever the thing is, I need to know if I put a dollar in, what happens that dollar? If I don't know what's happening to it, you do not spend the dollar, okay? It's one of the rules of direct response marketing. In fact, it's number four here, there should always be tracking and measurement. So we track it, if I can't track it, I'm not gonna spend it. If I can track it, cool, I'm gonna spend it, and it's back in the watch, make it smart, look, see if the money comes back to me with more money, if it doesn't, we stop. I think that was a Mr. Wonderful thing from Shark Tank. I'm gonna give you some money, and my money will come back to me with a bunch more friends, right? That's what we're trying to do here. We're gonna put money into advertising, right? Hopefully that money comes back with more money, otherwise we stop it, right? Tracking and measurement, okay? Again, another one of the rules. Which actually leads me to rule number five, which here is about brand building, okay? Whenever brand building occurs, we'll be happy byproduct that will not be bought, okay? This is what I think, this is like the constant debate between direct response marketers and brand marketers, right? Brand people are like, oh, I spent so many on this brand and the logo and the design, and we're gonna do things, hopefully increase the lift to what we're doing, right? Again, proactive, if they would have done that, they would have gone bankrupt, right? They'd spend $5 million in infomer, super old commercial to lift their brand, right? That's not trackable, so not measurable, okay? If I would have spent millions and millions of dollars trying to build the ClickFunnels brand, I would have gone broke and bankrupt way long time ago. Instead, what I did, I spent millions and millions of dollars a month on direct response marketing, trackable, measurable, right? Two of my ClickFunnels offers products and services, and by default of like, because of the direct response marketing things I did that were trackable and measurable, it built a brand as a side product. We're not spending money to build a brand. We're spending money on direct response things that people will see our ads, they'll see stuff like that, and from that it builds a brand, okay? So again, rule number five here, whatever brand building occurs will be a happy byproduct, but it will not be bought. Do not spend money on branding, okay? It goes against everything we talk about in direct response marketing. Let's move on to number six. Number six, thou shalt not do one step marketing. There shall be a follow up, okay? As you guys know, the fortune is in the follow up. This is one of the low hanging fruit in any business. I have a lot of people who hire me for consulting and they come in and they're like, okay, I'm gonna blow up my business, they build me a funnel. I'm like, well, before we build your funnel, like how many customers do you have? How many, you know, how much, in fact, one of the, a really good example is I had a buddy who, a personal trainer actually hired him. After my wife and I got married, I was wrestling and then wrestling ended, and she got pregnant with twins like the same weekend. And so for the next, you know, nine months, she was eating for her and two others, and I was trying to keep up with her and I wasn't wrestling anymore, and I gained like 40 or 50 pounds with the pregnancy. Then one day she had twins and then lost all the way. Next day I was like, still the same. And I was either way for five or six years and I was like, I have to take control of this. So I went and hired a personal trainer, started working out with him, super cool guy, and over time helped me lose a bunch of weight. And we talked about marketing all the time. Like he was like, how do these principles that you do how they work in my business? And I remember one day he was like, like what should I do first? Like what kind of funnel should I build? What would it look like? Should I run radio ads, direct mail? Like what should I do first? I was like, none of it. I was like, do you have any dead files? He's like, what's a dead file? Like dead files, someone who came here at one time, they were a customer or a potential customer and now they're not. He's like, oh, I got a whole filing cabinet full of people. I'm like, okay, I'm gonna show you magic trick. You're gonna think I'm a marketing wizard. Okay, but this is, and I asked him, how many people do you need to fill up this gym to make it where you wouldn't need to buy any more advertising? I can't remember, it was like, if I had 50 new clients, it would be everything. And his mind was gonna take him, two years of marketing to get 50 new clients. I was like, okay, I'm gonna show you magic trick. Okay, I said, give me your dead files, open up your filing cabinet, grab everyone who's ever came in here. And if you have their name, their email, their phone number, put them in a big huge Excel sheet. So he spent all week long and did the whole thing, came back to me and was like, hey, I've got, I can't remember, 500 people that have come through in the last five years, that had their contact info, put an Excel sheet. I took that, I was like, okay, I'm gonna show you magic trick. I uploaded it and I said, send this email out to the people. And he wrote email, I was like, hey, I've spent a while since I've seen each other, have you gained any weight? Do you want some help with, you want some help getting back in shape? If so, here's an offer, made a really good offer. I said, send that email three times over the next seven days and see what happens. So he sent it day number one, two days later, like send it again, send it again. I came back a week later and in a week, he was like, dude, he's like, you need to, like we have to stop, like stop what? He's like, I can't keep sending his email. Like, why not? He's like, I've got like 60, 70 new clients who've come in here, like people who reactivate. He's like, I did it all. I'm like, exactly. I'm like, you had all these amazing people who one time came to you and then they left and they still need what you have, probably more so now than they did initially and they just haven't talked to him about it. Like the fortunes and the follow up. Okay. And all we did is took his dead files and send emails. I've had other companies come in to that want, they have big companies that how do I grow my company and want me to talk about front and funnel? And first thing I'm like, what are you doing with your email list and your direct mail list and your text list and stuff? And they're like, nothing. Like we sent out the first 30 emails and then it just kind of ended. I'm like, okay, let's tack on 25 more emails at the end. We do that and boom, the business doubles. It's just like, that is the key, right? The average person has to see an offer seven times before they're willing to buy, an offer or a brand, right? And so if you spend a bunch of money ads, so when it comes and they click or they respond, they come to your thing and then they don't, you don't follow up them. Like the majority of people aren't gonna buy the very first time. So if you're not following up people, you lose all of that. Okay. So that's why rule number six is one of the most important. That shall not do one step marketing. We don't just buy an ad, hope that they buy and that's it. Right. We buy an ad, we follow up, we follow up, we follow up, we follow up for forever. Okay. I've been on Dan's list now for 20 some odd years and I keep getting messages still following up, right? There you go. Okay. Rule number seven, there shall be strong copies, sales copy. There's less resistance now than there used to be. When I first got into this business, again, I got in watching an infomercial, getting direct mail, things like that. And so I started seeing long form sales that are coming into my hands in the mailboxes, right? So I understood that and I came online and this stuff, like marketing was different online. But really quick, I found the people who were making money, all they did is they took a physical sales letter offline and they made an online version of it, right? It was a long form sales letter. If any of you guys remember 20 years ago, pre-video, pre-YouTube, pre-everything, everyone who's making money online, they had a long form sales letter. Just like something you get in the mail, right? And that's how it all started. And then from there, a transition when video started working and people started making video sales letters and then webinars and then all these things. But if you look at the core foundation of any kind of message, again, I don't care if it's direct mail, live event, challenge, webinar, video sales letter, sales letter, like all of them are all based on one thing and that is sales copy. Okay. It's learning how to communicate with your audience and how to get them to actually move. Okay. And so one of the most important vital schools you can learn to use to have is actually copy. You may be like, well, I'm not writing long form copy. It doesn't matter. It doesn't have to be written copy, verbal copy, right? Dan Kennedy is one of the best infomercial writers of all time because he wrote copy that became infomercials. Right? It's the same concept, same process to understand. Okay. So for all you guys, it's like, you got to be strong at sales copy. Getting better and better and better at it. And there's a lot of tools coming out nowadays. Obviously the ClickFun's role, they have funnel scripts. It's a great tool to build copy. Some of the new AI technologies come out to really, really cool and help shortcut copy. It's not perfect, but it's a way to speed up what you're doing. But man, it's one of the most powerful things for you guys to understand and to learn and to master. Because if you can start doing it on a written word, you can do it from stage, you can do it face to face, like the same principles, the principles are the same in every type of media. It's just understanding the principles and mastering them. Okay. So now shall learn a strong copy. Number eight, now shall not think, but my business is different. This is funny because the place we hear this the most is in events like this, right? Because you come in here and you're like, well, my business is different. Like Russell, I'm not an internet nerd. So it's not mine. Like, oh Marty, well, I don't have music school. So my business is different. I do something different, right? And in a perfect world, I could bring up every single person who's got something similar and bring them on stage. And all of a sudden you're like, oh, somebody's doing my business, okay? But I promise you that people are doing this process in every industry in the world. So it's happening. It works. And sometimes I may share something like that doesn't make sense because you're having internet business Russell and I've got a local brick and mortar. And it's like, yeah, maybe it's not the tactics aren't the same, but the strategy is, right? So understanding the strategy, like, oh, this is Russell did with his email campaign. How could I model that over here with my direct mail campaign? Right? The principles are the same tactics might be different, but your business is not different. I remember the very first Kennedy event I ever went to, whoever actually went to the old school retro back in the day, Dan Kennedy events, right? Where you come in the room and it wasn't like this, like an LED wall, there was like a big black curtain everywhere and then they didn't have like branding. Like I would think of it as like canvas signs. They were like hood holds them. They're like fish hooked up to these black curtains and we're walking in. There was like a big huge one that said, my business is different, ha ha ha or something like that. And then I heard Dan talking about it and like pointing to the sign, like making fun of like, most of you guys are gonna think this coming in, but my business is different. This doesn't work for my business. I can't do offers. I can't do this. I can't do cause you have some like preconceived notion that your business is different. And the reality is it's not, okay? In ClickFunnels we have like a hundred and something, thousand active members who use the platform and these in every market you can dream of. Even ones that don't make any logical sense. Like we've got a guy who literally takes people on big foot hunting expeditions. He's got a funnel for it and he crushes it. Like if it works for big foot hunting and it works for chiropractor and a dentist and a doctor and like it works. You just gotta think about how do I take this principle that's timeless, that's true, that works everywhere? How do I make the, like what are the tweaks I gotta make for it to fit into the thing that I'm doing? Okay? My guess is that Marty probably was one of, if not the very first music school owners show up and he was learning about this from, you know, Dan Kennedy's world, learning about it from how it works in chiropractor and real estate and restaurants and things like that. And he had to take those things and like, how does that work for my specific business? So you may have to make those little tweaks and the changes, but understanding these core principles, they are principles for reason. They don't shift, they don't change, they are perfect, they're flawless here today, tomorrow and they'll be here forever, as long as you're selling to humans. Okay? Number nine, Dash will not care about what friends, family or yourself thinks, results rule, period. Okay? When I first started this, probably like a lot of you guys, I'd show my funnels, my websites, my things to my, to people I know, like my friends, my family and they're like, what is that? Well, no one's gonna read that, that's too long. Like that's boring, like all the things, right? I do not care about this. The only person I care about, the only opinion I care is the person who's voting with their credit card. That's it. Okay? I wanna find who's the person who pulled their wallet out, pulled their credit card out. That's the only person's opinion I care about. If they're not purchasing with their credit card, I don't care. Okay? So I don't show my friends, my family members, my funnels anymore. I put it out there, I send them to the market and the market's gonna vote with their credit card. If they pull their credit card out, like boom, then means this offer's great. If they don't, it means, ah, the offer sucks. I'm making new offer, I'm making new offer, making new offer until I get an offer where somebody says, oh, that's so good, I'm gonna pull my credit card out of my wallet, I'm gonna vote saying yes, I want that. And since that offer's good enough to pull their credit card out, boom, it means that I did something right, right? That's the key here. So do not care about your friends, family, or yourself things, results, rule, period. That's the key we gotta focus on. There's number nine. And then number 10, thou shalt be tough-minded, implementer, and take massive action. The entrepreneurs that have the most success are those who are learning and applying, learning and applying, okay? The ones who are learning and learning and learning and continually learning are not having success. I saw this 20 years ago when I first joined Dan's Mastermind back in the day. And there were people in the group who spent a lot of money to be there, right? And they learned something like, oh, cool. In the next meeting they come back and they're still talking about it. I'm like, what are you guys doing? I remember my very first meeting I got there and in the room, I think there were 18 people in the room, plus Bill Glazer, so that was what was happening. Everyone had a chance to pitch their business. One guy got on stage and showed out, he had a call center. And I was like, I need a call center. Next person got up, I do live events. I'm like, I need you live events. And I watched every single person share their business. And I went home and between that meeting and the next meeting, I built a call center and launched it. Did my very first live event. I did a direct mail campaign and a radio campaign because two guys had that. And by the time I came back, I'm like, here's what I did. Everyone's like, you implemented all that since last meeting? I'm like, yeah. I'm doing this with a sense of urgency. This is important. I gotta get this done, right? Because I gotta show up to you guys again in three or four months now and show what I did. And most everyone else in the room was like, oh, wow, we were still trying to decide if we should do it or not. I'm like, what? The people who have success won't just take massive action, okay? A lot of you guys spent five days with each other. I'm so busy at the time, but I was here for five days every single day learning and figuring things out. And then you're like nervous, like, do I take the action? Do I not? I don't know if I have time for this. You don't have time for this. You spent all week with us hanging out. You've got time. And if you don't have time means you're doing it wrong. It means your systems are not in place. It means you can keep doing what you're doing and keep going and spinning these circles or you can stop for five seconds, go through this, plug it in and say, okay, I'm gonna do this, get the systems built so I can actually have some time. All right, those are the 10 commandments of direct response marketing. My question for you is, are you breaking some of those? Which ones are you doing? Which ones are you not doing? Which ones you need? Shifting your business and your life. So that way you can follow all the 10 commandments from my man, Dan Kennedy, who again, is my original mentor. This is who I learned marketing and business from. I had a chance a couple years ago to buy his business, which is why I always talk about him because he is just one of the coolest people in the world. In fact, recently I did a couple different videos going deep on Dan Kennedy philosophy, his teachings, and so there's gonna be some links up above and around me. You can go check out some more Dan Kennedy videos if you wanna learn directly from the man himself. Check out these videos right now and let me know what you think in the comments down below.
