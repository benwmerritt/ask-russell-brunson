What's up everybody? It's Russell Brunson. Welcome to the Marketing Secrets podcast. Now I still am planning on giving you guys a huge recap of the viral video event, bubble soccer, everything else that went down at the event cause some crazy stuff happened. I'm also trying to get permission from Gary V. Let me share some of his presentation with you guys here. So that's the game plan. If I'm able to do that, you'll see it soon. And you'll see my recap soon as well. But this week I've got my inner circle here. So I'm in there locked away. So what I didn't want to do is I got the video clip for my presentation at the event. I talked about how to go from zero to $100 million in sales. How we did that by using sales, followings and growth hacking. And it was a shorter presentation but I think it was really, really cool. I'm sure I talked really, really fast. I was also really tired. I had only slept one hour the night before. So if it doesn't make any sense, that's kind of the context of why. But hopefully I'll give you guys some ideas about how to scale company. You hear me talk about in the dot com secrets book a lot. Like whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins. And sometimes when you hear that, it's kind of depressing. Like, well I don't have a lot of money. I'm not gonna win. And that's how I felt, especially when we launched ClickFunOwns and we're competing against two companies. One that had like $40 million in funding. One that had over a hundred millions. Like how do you do that? And this presentation shows you how we did it. So after we do the little marketing secret intro here, I'm gonna pick right up with my presentation from the event. I hope you love it. Thanks so much and we'll talk to you soon. So the big question is this. How are entrepreneurs like us, who didn't cheat and take on venture capital, we're spending money from our own pockets. How do we market in a way that lets us get our products and our services and the things that we believe in out to the world and yet still remain profitable? That is the question in this podcast will give you the answer. My name is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing Secrets. I put together this presentation because like the biggest question I get, especially from people that are building their own companies is like how in the world have you grown and split funnel so fast without having any money, any capital, any outside funding at all? And so I put together this presentation this morning, I said I had one hour of sleep last night and they got up and I started working this presentation. But to kind of walk you through what we did and some of the mindset shifts that I think they're different that hopefully will help you guys as you're growing and scaling everything you guys are doing. So taught in my presentation is how we use growth hacking and sales funnels to go from zero to $100 million in less than three years or a week away without taking on any outside funding. So kind of the first thing I want to go over really quickly for those of you who didn't know what I was talking about earlier, I'm gonna go over what a funnel is really quick. So what is a funnel? So if you look at, actually let me step back. So the reason why I want to talk about this is it's been interesting like, I've been doing this internet marketing game for 15 years now, it's my 15th year in the business selling all sorts of stuff. And it's interesting because recently there's been a whole bunch of books coming out on like growth hacking, it hit all these cool new ways to growth hack. And it's funny because as we get the growth hacking books and reading them, it's like that's all the internet marketing stuff we've been doing for like the last decade. And now it's like real businesses are catching on and figuring out these things are really, really cool. So that's kind of why, that's kind of my thought behind this presentation is showing that like, all these funnel things is this is the growth hacking, this is the movement, this is where things are going that we keep talking about. So what's a funnel? So to explain a funnel, I think the easiest way to begin with is to show you what a funnel is not. So this is like a traditional style website, right? This is what ClickFunnels is kind of going against all the time. And most of the traditional website, they got all sorts of ads, they're paying for Facebook, YouTube, Google, all these things. And they're driving it into these websites literally like slamming a whole bunch of people into their brick wall. Okay, and I know like this is how I got started, I was trying this thing and it did not work. And I always say that a traditional website is kind of like having a really bad salesperson who's shy and all they do is they hand out brochures and then pray the person comes back. Like that's the traditional website. What a funnel is, is basically having the best salesperson on planet Earth come and meet the person in the front door, find out their name and walk them through the process, find out what they want, how they want it, and give them exactly what they want. So that's kind of what a sales funnel is. Now my whole philosophy and business kind of like I told you guys in the last presentation, like when we started ClickFunnels three years ago, we had two major competitors that we were looking at. Number one had just gotten $43 million in funding, and number two had just had over $100 million in funding. And I'm coming in with me and Todd and we were bankrolling it with our big old credit cards and we're like, okay, we're going against these huge giants that have hundreds of millions of dollars, how are we gonna win? And one of my first mentors, Dan Kennedy, he used to say this all the time, he said, whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins. And so I'm looking at these companies that have hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, I'm like, I'm screwed. I'm not gonna be able to win. These guys can outspend me every single day. And I started looking at this more and more and I didn't get it at first. It took me a couple of years before I understood this concept of whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins. And like I told you guys before, I went to college here at Boise State, and I wrestled here and I used to carry my buddies on my back up and down the football stadium every single day before practice. Like this is my hometown. So here in Boise, one thing we're famous for, those who are not from Idaho, is we're famous for potatoes. And the very first product I ever put together was the DVD teaching people how to make potato gun. And you've probably heard me tell a story before, but it was the DVD of how to make potato guns. I set it up online, I was learning about internet marketing, it was really simple. I had a one page website and I had Google ads. That's all that we did back in the day. So I went to Google and I started buying ads. I was spending about $10 a day on Google ads and I was selling a $37 DVD on how to make potato guns. So I'd spend $10 a day on ads and I'd usually average about one sale per day. So Russell as a college kid was making a whopping $27 per day profit I was putting it in my pocket, which was pretty awesome. And that was kind of my beginning. And then what happened is a little while into this whole game, Google shifted how everything worked and I got in big, big trouble and all of a sudden literally overnight, my website was the same, but I went from spending $10 a day and ads to $50 a day overnight. And so I spent $50 a day sending it to the exact same website, but I was only making one sale, the same thing. And so now I was losing $13 a day. And my beautiful wife after about three or four days of that said, you have to stop. This is not a good business. This is really, really bad. And so we stopped and eventually had to cut up our credit cards and I thought I missed the bubble. I'm like, dang it, we missed it. And those are actually real pictures of us cutting up our credit card back in our first home. About that time I had a friend who was also in the business and he came back and he said, Russell, I think I figured this out. He said, my little website, he had the same problem. Google raised the prices, algorithms changed and a bunch of my friends all got out of business. One of my friends came back and he said, I figured it out. He's like, I started adding in these things. He called them OTOs, which stands for one time offer. But basically an upsell. He said, I started adding upsells to my products and I started making more money from every customer. And now I'm able to forward my ads again. I turned my ads back on. I was like, that's cool. But I don't know how, how can I do that? I don't know how to do that. And I was like, I have a potato gun DVD. Like what should I do? And he's like, well, people who buy potato gun DVDs, what else do they need? How else can you serve them? And I was like, well, we could buy them, like the next piece is they had to buy potato gun kits. Like to buy pipes and the barbecue can out all these other pieces, right? And so he's like, we should sell a kit. I'm like, I don't want to make kits. That would be really not cool. And he's like, well, see if you can find some. So I ended up finding a guy in Northern Idaho who actually was drop shipping potato gun kits. They had a partnership with him. And I made my very first funnel. This is my funnel transition. So people would buy my DVD and they'd upsell a $200 potato gun kit. And we sent it out in the mail. Now what was cool, I turned the Google ads back on back in the day. And what happened was I still was paying about $50 a day. But then one out of three people would start buying the potato gun kit. So we did math on that. One out of three people means I was averaging about $65 in additional sales from every DVD I got that I sold, which meant I was spending about $50 a day in ads. And now I was making $102 in ads. And all of a sudden it worked again. Like that was magic. Literally when I made that shift, I went from losing money to $8, now I was making $50 a day profit. And I was like, this is it. This is the biggest thing in the world. Now for me, obviously, potato guns is a very small market. And I didn't stay there long. But the concept of that rang through my head. I was like, this is how it works. And more than I learned from this whole experience was that the funnels make me money. Websites make me broke. And so my obsession for the last decade of my life has been this. A lot of you guys have been to my events for the last decade. Teaching this concept has shown kids this is the key. And so when I started doing this and started realizing it, that message I heard from my mentor kept coming back from head saying, whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins. That was the key. Whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins. And so as we came into this game of click funnels, I'm looking at these people with hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital behind them. I'm like, how in the world do we compete with that? I was like, I can't do it. I head for head. They can all outspend me. But if I can build a funnel that's right, I can change everything. And if you look at the reason why we have grown as fast as we can, it's because we can literally outspend everyone. We get, man, probably three or four times a week different people trying to put money into click funnels. And most of me just tell them, though, but a couple we've entertained just because it's interesting. I'm curious what they think we're worth. And it's really fun. And so we're at lunch this day with this group. And I'm talking to the guy who's going through everything. And he asked the question. They always ask on a shark tank. He's like, well, how much does it cost to acquire a customer? And I was like, I hate when people ask me this question, because he's not going to get what I'm going to tell him. And I was like, well, when we were running Facebook ads to the homepage, we're spending about $120 to acquire a free trial member. And he was like, oh, that's amazing. He's like, based on that, he's like, what I can do is I can go and we can put in $50 million in cash. And we get this many cards, all the stuff. And I was like, well, real quick, we actually turned those ads off. He's like, you turn those ads off. And I'm like, yeah, I got to pay for this out of my own pocket. Like, I don't want to lose $120 to every customer. And he's like, well, how are you guys growing so fast? I said, well, the reason why is because we have funnels. And I explained to him some of our friend end funnels, like my book funnels and other funnels. I said, look, for every single person that comes in with my funnels, if they buy one of my books, we spend on average about $10 to $12 on our Facebook ads or other ad platforms to sell a book. But then through that funnel, we average about $32. So I said, what happens is that we spend $12. We get something to buy one of our books. We make net $20 of cash we put in our pocket. And then we introduce them to click funnels. So every single customer, before we tell them about click funnels, they actually pay us money. And we put that money in our pocket. He's like, that doesn't make any sense. And I explained it again. He said, it makes sense. I said, three or four times. Then he stopped and he said, if what you're saying is true, he said, that'll change business forever. I was like, that's my whole message. That's what we do. That's what funnels are all about. So I'm going to walk you guys really quick through this. And then we're going to have Gary come up here in a minute. But one of the key concepts you guys need to understand, this is a concept we call a break-even funnel. Those are my inner circle members who are here. We spend a lot of time on this. But the break-even funnel is a funnel where you break even, so you can literally get customers for free. When you have that, you can grow your company as quick, as big, as fast as you want. So you spend a lot of time on that. So this is what a break-even funnel, where I commit a dollar in advertising in and get at least a dollar back out. And if I'm good at it, I can get $2 or $3 back out. Now I've got a customer. I've got some cash. Now we can put them into what we into the other things that we have. A couple examples of some of our break-even funnels. I grabbed these from some slides this morning, showing you examples. So this is my .com Secrets book. This is a couple of months ago stats. We got about 5,400 leads. We sold 2,395 books. Average cart value during that time was $30.81. So we spent $45,000 in ads. We made $52,000 in sales. So our profit was $7,763. Now most people, if you look at a company our size, you're like, that's a waste. Like you just wasted a lot of it. You made $7,000. That's not that big of a deal. But that was to get customers. We got 5,400 people that then the next week were going to say, hey, by the way, this is a really cool thing called click funnels. And I got paid $7,000 to get those 5,400 people into my list. That was one of our front-end products. This is a split testing book. Same kind of thing. We had 2,000 leads. It came last month. 1,300 books sold. Average cart value was $12. Ad spend was $4,000. Sales was $18,000. So we made $13,000. But we got 2,000 people. Then now we can introduce the click funnels. So we got paid to get all these customers. One more example is perfect webinar. Same kind of thing. Leads, sales. I'll go through this quickly. The same thing. We made $4,000. We got 1,600 customers. We introduced into click funnels. Now if you walk through those three funnels alone, and we have about a dozen or so front-end funnels we use in different platforms and things, last month from this, basically our front-end revenue was $96,000. Our ad cost was $81,000. So we netted a whopping $14,000. Most people think, man, we're all with a company with 120 employees. Like, you're going to go broke fast, right? But what's amazing about that is that that brought in literally like 30,000 or 40,000 new people into our world, who then we took them through the rest of our sequence. They were introduced to us. Now we can go and we can build a relationship with them. We can talk to them. We can serve them. We can help them understand what we do, what we believe, and then introduce them into our other products and our services. And for us, obviously that is click funnels. And so if you look at that, what that means for us is that we literally get almost 1,000 new trials for free every single day by clockwork. That comes back to TalkBateForward. That's how we're able to grow so fast. Because we can literally outspend everybody in our market. There's nobody else that we can do that. And what's cool about that is for you guys, whatever business you're in, that's the key. Remember, whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins, and when you figure that out, it makes you can grow really, really quickly. Any kind of business, any kind of venture, anything you want to do. And so that, you guys, is how we use growth hacking and sales phones to go from zero to $100 million in just three years without taking on any outside funding. Thank you. Thank you for everythingッ
