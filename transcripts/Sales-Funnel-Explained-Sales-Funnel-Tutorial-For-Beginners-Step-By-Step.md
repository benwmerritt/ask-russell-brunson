Hey everybody, this is Russell Brunson, and today we're talking about sales funnels, tutorials for beginners. And to do that, I wanna show you guys my very first sales funnel I built as a beginner. In fact, this is a picture of me here on the slide. This is me with my shaved head making a potato gun. This is one of the very first landing pages for how to make potatogun.com. And there's a doodle of me shooting potato guns because I am a potato gun expert. But we're gonna talk about just the basic concepts behind a sales funnel because I think at first, people get all complicated. Like, oh, it's gonna be really difficult, it's gonna be hard. But when I understand this, it's really, really simple. So here is an actual potato gun. I don't know if you can see on the camera or not. But we're gonna walk you guys through this. When I first created this with my buddy Nate Plung, I was going to college at the time, I was trying to figure out like, how do I make money on the internet? And someone said, you should sell information products. I was like, that's awesome, but I don't know anything about anything. And then that weekend was spring break, and Nate and I went and we made potato guns. Had a great weekend. And then fast forward to like the next Monday and back in school, sitting there, kind of like doing the board school thing. And also, and I was like, wait a minute, I know how to make a potato gun now. That's an information. Kind of created a product about that. And so I was freaking out. I went online at the time there's a website you could search to see how people were searching for different keywords. And there were 18,000 people a month searching for the phrase, how to make a potato gun, or potato gun plans, or spud gun plans. And nobody had a product. And I was like, light bulb, I'm gonna make a product teaching that. So I got Nate, we went down to Home Depot, we got a video camera out, we filmed this whole thing, and we made our very first product. And I put it online and I didn't know how to sell anything. So I just had like a basic website. The website was like, hey, come and buy my thing. And then I went to this thing called Google. You guys may have heard of it before. And on Google, they had these things right here and on the side, there were these ads. And so I would pay for the Google ad. So I'm gonna click on the ad, they'd come over here, they would see this thing and they're like, oh my gosh, I must buy this DVD so I can learn how to make a potato gun. And some of them would give me money. Initially when we first started selling this, we were selling it for, $37 a piece. And so people would buy that. And that was my business. And I remember putting the ads up and I was spending about 10 bucks a day, let me do the math over here. So I was spending $10 a day in ads over here. And from there, I was averaging about one sell a day. Okay, now as a college kid, I'm looking at this, I said, okay, I give someone 10 bucks, I give Mr. Google 10 bucks. And then he gives me back 37. It means I got $27 to put in my pocket. Next day I gave Mr. Google 10 bucks, he gave me back 37, I put 27 in my pocket, I kept doing this and I was like, I am the smartest man alive. And then something evil happened. The guys over at Google decided they wanted to make more money and so they changed their algorithms. I'm not gonna get into that, but they changed their algorithm and so no longer was it like, I spent $10 and I make 37. Instead I started spending $10, excuse me, like my ad cost went up, so I started spending $50 a day to make one sell. Okay, now I'm not the sharpest tool in the toolbox, but I gave Google 50 bucks and they gave me back 37. And I was like, wait, I lost money. And then I gave him 50 and then I lost 37. After three or four days I'm like, wait a minute, this game sucks, I'm losing. And so I turned my ads off, Mike, I can't play this game. And I remember being frustrated. And then one day I got a call from my friends. And my friends had a similar business to me. He said, hey Russell, I think I figured it out. I said, figured what out? He's like, I stopped, and he didn't call it the funnel. He's like, I created this thing called an upsell. He called it an OTO, one time offer. He said, what I did is that every single person about my product, I then upsold him something else. And I was like, well, why would I do that? And he's like, well, have you ever been to McDonald's before? Like, yeah. He's like, well, you know when you go to McDonald's and you go through the drive through and you're like, hey, I wanna order a Big Mac. And the dude's like, cool, do you wanna supersize it? Do you want fries and a Coke with that? And he starts offering you upsells. I'm like, yeah. And he's like, if you look at the math, he's like McDonald's actually loses money selling a Big Mac. But they make all their profit and someone buys the fries and the Coke. I was like, okay. He's like, right now you're losing money selling your potato and DVD. You just gotta sell these guys fries and Coke and you'll be profitable. And I was like, I still don't quite get it. He's like, if someone buys this, like what's the next thing you can do? If you were trying to serve this person, like what's the next thing you could serve them with? And I said, well, when someone buys a DVD, the most annoying thing is not have to go to home deep and they have to buy the pipes and have to cut them and like all this stuff to make this amazing gun. And he said, well, what if instead of you tell them to go buy the stuff, what if you upsold them a kit that did this whole thing? I've no idea if this is gonna show up on camera or not. But I thought it was kind of cool. And so he said, make it upsell where you sell them the kit. So here is the kit. So I did some math and I started calling around and I found these guys, Northern Idaho, actually made potato gun kits. And I would start selling these for 197 bucks. And now this became my very first funnel ever. Again, I didn't know it was called the funnel at time. But someone would come, they'd click on the ad, they would see my DVD, they would buy my DVD. On the next page, our upsells say, hey, the DVD's coming, do you want me to ship the pipes with you too so save you some time? Just 197 bucks. You'd be like, that would be fantastic. And they click the button, they would buy it. Now what happened, if you look at the math, was interesting, the Google didn't change their ad cost. They still were charging me 50 bucks a day. So that didn't change. But they came here and I spent $37, so I lost some money. But then what happened is that one out of three people who bought the DVD would buy this. So let's say I got a bunch of clicks over here, boom. And so there's three people right here that bought the DVD. One of these people then would go and buy this. For every DVD I sold, so I'd make $37, one third of those people bought this. So I'd take 197, I'd divide it by three, but do the math and then that's 65 bucks. So if I take $65 plus $37, seven plus five equals 12, not nine, 10, one, oh two. So now I was making $102 for every single person who bought the DVDs, that makes sense. Cause one out of three bought the kit as well. Okay, so now I was on Google, I was paying 50 bucks a day in ads, but I was making on average $102 a day. I put $50 in, I got $102 back. Okay, and all of a sudden I started looking and I was like, I am the smartest man alive again. I spent $50, I get back $102. And so I was back in business, potato guns sales were cranking, I was having a good time, and I realized, wait a minute, potato guns are good, but the market's like this little. Like what other markets could I do this with? And I started thinking, I said, well, what if I did this in speed reading? I met a guy who was the world's fastest reader, Howard Burke, and so we set up a funnel for speed reading and it worked. And we said, well, if we do this in the dating market, I found someone who's a dating expert, we plugged it in. What if we did this with supplements, what if we did, and we started doing this, and the funnels obviously tweak every single time, but the concepts are the same. And I became obsessed and over the next five or six years, I launched over a hundred different funnels and a hundred different markets and became obsessed with it, and it became so much fun. But this concept of a funnel works in any business. And so what I wanted you guys to understand is this how simple it really is. It's not some complicated thing. Sometimes we get all complicated. It's very simple. It's like we buy an ad to sell something, somebody buys that thing, then what's the next logical thing they need? Well, if they bought a potato gun, the next thing they need is they need a potato gun kit. And that becomes my funnel. And that's kind of where we take people through.
