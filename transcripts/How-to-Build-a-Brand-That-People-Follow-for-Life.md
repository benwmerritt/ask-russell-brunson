What's up everybody? This is Russell. Welcome back to the podcast or the YouTube channel, whatever your eyes are watching this on. I hope you guys are having a great day today. I'm recording this right now as I am about to leave and jump in a plane to fly the funnel hacking live the 10th in the last ever funnel hacking live. And I've been at the office all day today. It's a Saturday. I'm working on my slides and my presentations trying everything perfect for you guys who are going to be there. And I just wanted to stop and record this podcast and this video because I've got this core thing on my head that I wanted to share. I don't think I've ever shared this in this way before, but it is the secret to how we created a movement. And there's two core things you have to have to be able to create a movement of people who are going to follow you. You have a chance to change your life. And so I'm going to walk through what those two things are because if you understand these, it'll change everything for you. Most people, when they start a business, they have these product-based businesses that are selling a product versus like creating an actual movement and like how are we going to move people and change people. And through that process, you've been growing. And so that's the first half of business, the growth side. And you've went through those problems, those issues. And the reason why you went through them is because you've learned something. You learned now how to serve someone who is just like you. I think about business all the time. I talk about how business is contribution. You have growth and then you contribute. And the contributions now going back to the people who are just like you five years ago, before you got started, you're taking all the lessons you learned, both the positive, the pain that you got going to the gym, the positive pain, but also the negative pain and the trials and the issues you went through. And then you learned through all that process. You came out the other side unscathed, maybe you're scathed a little bit, but you came out the other side as a better person. You grew and now your business is about contribution, going back and helping those people. And those are the people I'm most passionate about serving is the people, the entrepreneurs who are doing that, who are in that phase of the business right now. That's really what I want to talk about during this podcast is like, not like here's how to start a business, but like you actually want to build a movement of people where you're going to find these people that God's called you to help. You're going to gather those people together and get these people are people who are just like you five years ago. You're going to gather them together and you're going to change your life. How do we actually do that? Okay. And there's a lot of ways to do it. There's a lot of things, but there are two core ones that I've been thinking about a lot today that I want to share with you. The very first one, and this is interesting. I remember I have my category King's group, which is like $150,000 a year. And we had some guys coming in and they were asking specifically about like, should I write a book? Should we not write a book? And I remember I shared something just kind of as an afterthought about thinking about it. And then like a month later, I saw it on the podcast, their Instagram channel, like that it was like one of those big like mic drop moments for them. And I was like, Oh, that kind of is. And so they asked me, like, should we, should we write a book? What I told them, I said, if you think about it, every great mass movement throughout time and history always started with a book. Okay. Think about this. I think about at least the major religions that I know about, right? I think about Christianity, glad with the book, the Bible, boom, right? Think about the, again, I'm Mormon. So the Mormon faith, right? It started with a book, the Book of Mormon. You think about Islam, like every, every major mass movement started with the book, right? When I launched the ClickFunnels business, we had ClickFunnels made the software and luckily at the same time I was writing a book with my thoughts and ideas about how to build funnels and boom, on the backside of launching ClickFunnels out came dot com secrets. This was the book that started the movement, right? I remember we launched ClickFunnels. I think it was like September we launched, we did an initial launch in like, during the summertime, let a group of people in there and close it down. And then in September, we did the official launch, which are people started coming in and it was crazy. People came in and like, they use the software, didn't use like, it didn't stick. Like we can get people to stick, can get people to sign up. It was tough, right? And this is the time where I'm thinking about creating a movement versus just selling software. In fact, I had this really cool experience. Some of you guys know David Frye. He's one of my friends and mentors and David was in a network marketing company with me at the time. There's a company called Send Out Cards. Some of you guys may remember Send Out Cards, but it was in this company and I'd never, I'd promoted it. Like I'd never actually been to an event. David's like, you have to come to me. You have to see what this is like. And so I come to this event. It's in Salt Lake City and it's a three or four day event. I'm sitting there and you know, I'm there. I'm used to going to marketing events. I'm there with a pad of paper or a dang candidate event. So I'm there with pad of paper ready to take notes. I'm sitting there the first day and like first people get up on stage, they're telling their story and then they're crying. And then next people get on stage and tell their story, they're crying. And then someone gets up and they get in a war and then someone else gets in a war. And I'm like, what is happening? I'm like so confused. Like day number one, no notes. Day two, day three, and by the like day three or day four, I remember Dave lived in Lindo, he's like, do you see what's happening? I was like, no, I have no idea what's happening right now. And he goes, they didn't create a software company. They created a movement and it was like, ah, boom. So for me, right? Fast forward a year later, I've got this new software company called ClickFunnels and I'm trying to figure out how to sell it as a SaaS company. I'm looking at what are the other big SaaS is doing? I'm trying to model them, right? So we're funnel hacking these SaaS companies and we're struggling, nothing's working, nothing's converting. It's too expensive to acquire leads. Like everything was just not working. And then all of a sudden that light bulb hit my head from David Fry like they don't have a software company, which it was sent out cards to the software company, log in and you type thing, you click send it sends a card to somebody's software, right? They don't have a software company. They built a movement and I started thinking, oh, that's the difference. How do I build a movement? Right? And luckily at the end of the time I'd been writing this book for a decade. This was like, for me, the decade prior to ClickFunnels, I was, I was learning these principles. I was doing them. I was having so much fun building funnels and trying these things out and I was going to these events and teaching and talking about it and sharing what was happening. I started like, I always wanted it to write a book. In fact, I remember it was, it was, man, it was almost 10 years. It was like 10 years before I ever wrote.com secrets. I was in an event and it was my, it was Armour and Mourne's event. And I remember they kept talking about writing your own book, writing your own book. And then I remember David Hancock, who was Morgan James publishing, he was there and he was like, Russell, you should write a book. I was like, I should write a book. So I paid him to help me to write a book that way back then. And then I remember, see, I met Brendan Brouchard the very first time. Brendan was kind of new in the industry. Just like I was and he just written his book called Life's Golden Ticket. And on the front of the book, there's like this circus tent on it. And he told me, he's like, I sold the book and people start reading. And then I do these events in there in circus tents, he explained the whole thing. You know, like, this is so cool. I gotta have a book. That was my thought. So for 10 years, I thought about a book, kept thinking about it, kept changing the title and changing it back and forth. But, you know, it took me a decade to finally sit down and like, I'm gonna write this book. So I sat down and finally started writing it. I took a decade in my life, all these things I've been learning and studying and practicing and trying, right? All the funnels in the front end, the back end and copywriting, like just everything. And I put it into this book, right? And this was not like a fast little thing. This is a labor of love. Like I spent, man, two years or so researching, writing, putting it together, rewriting it, all this stuff to make the DotCom Secrets book become a thing, right? And so again, ClickFunnels launches in September. I think the the DotCom Secrets book launch was in February or March. We're like within first four or five months, boom, we launched this book. And this book created the movement. People got it, right? And it's the doctrine or the dogma or whatever you want to call it, right? So we got the book, they read it and they're like, Oh my gosh, now I understand what Russell's trying to tell me because I read it inside of a book, right? The book gives them again, the initial thing about this from a religious movement. So the doctrine, right? Here's the doctrine of like the belief system that you and your following your movement has, right? Something they can read, they can talk about, they can like get behind, which is another reason why it's very important to write a good book and not a crappy book. So I'll leave that for, I'll go around there in a few seconds. But this book became that. So we launched out in the world, people started reading it. We sold over 100,000 copies and it became like the foundation for this movement, people to read it, understand it. And now they understood what we did, what we thought about, what we were teaching. And all of a sudden, like that was the first foundation point, right? And so the first of the two things I want to share with you, number one is like, if you want to create a movement, you've got to write a book, right? The book is like, again, the doctrine or the dogma or the principles or whatever you want to call it for your people, for your movement, for your following, for the people you are bringing into the world to be able to help them, right? And they have something to look back to is like, this is like what the truth is. This is what the foundational core principles are. Okay. Now I'm going to go down the rant about writing good book. I want you to understand like why I'm not a big fan of like, Hey, here's how to write a book in a weekend or have AI write your book or whatever. Like, in fact, I'm mildly obsessed with books, probably notice this. Just my back right, watching the videos, there's dozens, dozens or so books. But in the last three years, I've bought over 18,000 books, most of them first editions rare books, like I'm obsessed with books because I know what it takes to write a really, really good book, right? And you can never, I don't know, maybe someday AI will get smarter than all of us. But like, for me to write dot com seekers, expert seekers, the traffic seekers, like the writing of the book was the most painful thing I had ever gone through. It gets so painful to write a book. But by going through the process of writing and thinking and the putting things together, like all these like insane, like, like the process of writing the book is where all these insights, these ideas come, like they all start, I don't know how to explain it other than when they first started a book, there's always like these, these siloed ideas and you start writing book, you have to put them together and when you do it, you start seeing these connections, these interactions that never were there before. That's why when people are like, Oh, I'm gonna have AI write my book, I'm going to speak on stage, then transcribe and turn to a book or whatever it's like, you're missing or even a ghostwriter. Because like the magic of my books came for me, like two in the morning, like wrestling between two or three different concepts. And all of a sudden it's like, Oh, this thing appears and you're like, there's the answer. And also it makes the book makes sense, right? It's like, you have to earn a book, you have to like birth it. And the reason why it's so important, because if somebody in your movement gets your book and your book sucks, okay, it will destroy everything quickly. In fact, I'm not going to say the person's name. You guys, a lot of you guys know who he is or who this person, I should say, I said he now cut it in half. But when I first got in this world, this person wrote a book and they kept talking about it. And I was like, this is so cool. And like, that was the person like, okay, that's the person I'm plugging into. This is my guru. Right. And they wrote this book, they did a big product launch around, they came in Amazon, best seller, all sorts of stuff, forever. I buy the book, I get in the mail and I'm so excited to read this book. Like I'm pumped, I'm on fire. Like, you have no idea like how much I anxiously waited for this book. So I preordered while they're waiting for the prelaunch, right? And then they shipped it and the book shows up, remember getting it. And I was like, I was so excited to read it. And I like blocked out time. I was gonna read it. I was gonna study it was gonna devour. I'm gonna like understand what's in this, this author's brain and like, it'll be in my brain. Right. It's like Tony Robbins calls it a decade and a day, right? A book gives you the ability to compress a decade of an author's life into a day and you can just read it. So I get the book, I sit down, I still on my shelf. I know exactly which one it is. And I start reading the book and it's, it was horrible. It was like, he had taken some tele seminars he had done transcribed them through in a book. There were typos or misspellings. It didn't go deep. There was no, it was just like surface level fluff. I remember I read that and I lost all respect for the person. I stopped following, stopped listening to him and I was just like, that's it. You don't want that happening. So get your book, right? You need to give them the insights, the stories, the way that's how you create a really, really good book. Okay. And if you do that, that's one of the core things about creating a movement, right? So step one, like if you want to really do this, like, what are the foundational thoughts, beliefs, principles, things that you have that you believe in, you can take and actually put into a book. Okay. And create something that's really good. Again, like Doc Com Secrets, I'm proud of this book. Like I bled for this book. Like it was so hard. Okay. For me, it takes me about two years to write a book on average. That's how much time and effort and energy I put into it. And obviously I'm not, in fact, my first two books, I went with kind of a smaller publisher in my third book. I went to Hey House, which is a bigger publisher. And remember, we did the contract negotiations. I wasn't paying that much attention, signed and think, and all of a sudden, like a week later in the mail, I get a check for a whole bunch of money. And I was like, what is this for? So I messaged them like, Hey, I got a check. I'm selling books yet. Like what's this for? I'm an entrepreneur. I'm used to like, I eat what I kill, right? Like I go kill something and then I get fed from it. Like for me to get money before I'd written the thing, it was so confusing. And they're like, Oh, that's your, that's your forward or your advance. I'm like, what? Like, well, like, what, like, what if I don't sell me books? How's this work? I need to pay it back. I was all stressed out. And they said, no, typically when, when you sign a book deal, the, you know, the publishing house gives you enough money, you can live for the year. So you don't have to work. So you can actually write the book. And I was like, Oh, that's how it works. Because for me, I'm working eight hours a day, running click funnels. And then I'm like, you know, five or six, seven hours a day as a dad and a father. And then I got like two hours a night in the morning, where I am writing my actual book. Right. I was like, I didn't know that's how it worked. Anyway, I probably should have done that because I would have gotten the book still a lot faster. But for me, it's a longer process. And if I take a lot of time, but it's like, again, I'm trying to figure out those insights. Like I had someone recently who wanted to help co-author a book with me. And I started on the path and I was just like, this can't work because like the writing of the book is how I discovered these principles by me being willing to go into the pages and into the work and do the stuff. That's where I believe God, let's start implanting ideas and thoughts into my head that made it actually become something amazing. Had I just tried to go the easy way, the cheap way and had AI or ghostwriter, somebody do it, it wouldn't have been the same. Okay. So that's the very, very first thing. All right. Okay. Now I'm sitting here, you guys, just you guys know, before I jump into number two, I got this cool new setup in my, in my office. In fact, I'm going to show you, I'm going to give you a couple of cameras here. So check this out. The way I do my work, I've got three different monitors here. So I got a teleprompter right here, which is really, really cool. Now I can put my notes here. If I'm doing a zoom call, you know, you do zoom with someone and you're like, you're looking down, you're trying to look at them because you're looking at their eyeballs. Now I can pull up into this thing right here. And then I could actually, I can talk to the person and have eye to eye contact. Anyway, I'm really excited. And the other cool thing is I have a couple of ads that I wrote for our stuff. And I can never do them in the past because I like, I'm looking down and the ad didn't work in the video, but guess what? I got a teleprompter now. So I'm going to read two ads just for my own products because I thought that'd be awesome. So the very first one is for a company you may have heard of called ClickFunnels. Now, obviously if you want to sell stuff online, you're going to need a good funnel. But if you want a great funnel, then you're going to need to use ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels is the number one funnel builder in the world, helping more first time entrepreneurs to leave their nine to five and to launch their dream than any other company in the world.

ClickFunnels, because you're one funnel away from changing the world. How was that? My first ad reach myself? I hope you guys enjoyed it. I know on the podcast I've been doing, we started selling ads over on the podcast I've been doing to reach for other companies. I thought this is way more fun to reach for my own. Okay. Number two, so number one, every mass movement of all time led with a book. Sit down, figure out your doctrines for your people, write a book. Like it'll change you, it'll change things for you more than anything else you can do. In fact, if you look at this, I've been in this business now for like 23, 24 years. I've launched so many courses, so many events, so many masterminds, so many things. And it's crazy because the only thing people come up to me later on and say, Hey, Russell, you changed my life. Your book changed my life. That's the word. It's always your book changed my life. It's never that event. It's never that course. It's never the way. Like the book is the theme. It's the thing that lasts beyond the life of the author. If you want legacy, if you want to live forever through your words, the book is the thing that actually does that. Okay. Like that's how important it is. That's why I'm obsessed with it. In fact, I remember, you know, back in the day I do this product launch, I see big spike in sales and a drop and another launch and another launch and we were doing launches multiple times a year. That's how I made our money. When we launched ClickFunnels, we started getting recurring revenue. It was crazy because it went like this really small and got bigger and bigger and bigger at a point where every single day I checked my Stripe app and it's half a million dollars is there every morning before I wake up and just like, this is insane. Okay. What's happening? And so then when we do these launches, I do a launch of a course like you see this little blip and I could barely registers on the thing. I'm like, what? Right. And I would launch a book, a little blip blip. And what I found is that almost anything I launched didn't actually have any long-term impact. Sales, the impact was so minuscule. It didn't actually matter in the grand scheme of things. The only thing that lasted beyond the launch was the book. The only thing that lasted beyond the life of the author is the book. Right? Think about this. Napoleon, why do we know him? He wrote books that are still around. Right? I think about people I know who run huge mega events. Right? When they die and those events disappear, so does the legacy. It goes away. Right? Like the book is the only thing that outlives the author. So write a book. All right. That's number one. Number two now. Second thing is if you want to create a movement and be like the leader in your industry, you have got to basically plant a flag in the middle and say, this is the industry event. We are the one. Okay? Phone Hacking Live 10 years ago. It was crazy. If you look at the timeline of events, right? Way back in the day, there were two events. There was an internet marketing event, Armour & Mourns big seminar, and there's Dan Kennedy's Info Summit and Super Conference. Right? And those were the two big things happening in the marketing world. Right? Internet version and then the direct selling version. Then eventually, Yonix Silver came out with the Underground. That came the second one. So there were two big internet marketing seminars and then the two direct response. So those are events like you had to be at every single year. Right? Fast forward 2008, 2009 economy crashes, events dry up, everyone cancels their events, no events for four or five years. Then they come back. First event happens, TNC. Ryan Dice, Perry Belcher launched TNC. Amazing event. It used to be you go to TNC and it was just Ryan and Perry teaching. I love both those guys. I think I could list a Perry tell stories for days. Like he's my favorite storyteller ever. And so we'd go to the event because I want to hear Ryan and Perry, Ryan and Perry. And then as they started getting bigger, the event got bigger. They started bringing more speakers and more speakers and Ryan and Perry got less and less and less. And eventually got the point where they had like 90 speakers. They had all these different breakout rooms. And if you go to the event, you might hear Perry talk once and Ryan talk once and that was it. And that's when I stopped going to TNC. And I remember that as feeling, my feeling as a consumer, I was just like, this is great. But like, I came for those guys and they're no longer speaking. So a whole bunch of people and I watched over the years of that event got smaller and ours started getting bigger. So when we launched ours, Funnel Hacking Live, there were there was there were TNC and they were the biggest. Like, I think at the time they were getting like 3000 people in the event. I'm like, how do I compete with that? I'm like, well, we're going to because I want to create my own versions. I had to put the flag in like, I'm gonna create the industry event and it became Funnel Hacking Live. Okay. We launched it, did the very first one. We had 600 people at it. Right. Second one, we had 1200 and kept growing and growing and growing over time. And eventually what was cool was that the event gave us the ability where our people, not all of our people, but it's the bottom of the funnel. Right. The bottom of the funnel to people who are the most hardcore, that are the craziest, that are the most fun, like those are the people that came to the event. Right. And so also you get the energy of like, who are the people that, that care the most and they show up and say, Oh, these are our people. And they're just like me. They're obsessed with the stuff. They're like, high energy. They're crazy. And that's how we built Funnel Hacking Live. Right. Like our dream people or the bottom of funnel came to the event, like the best people. Right. And what happened is like when they're there, it builds culture, it builds excitement and those will go out to the rest of the world. They, they take that energy and they resonate out to the rest of the world. Right. So even though only 4 or 5,000 people were able to come to Funnel Hacking Live at a time, the energy of that when it goes back out, just like ripple effects into the industry. Right. So it's such a powerful thing. It brings people together, gives them a chance to network, hang out. It gives you the ability to like speak directly to the people and I tell them what you're doing, but the future is like, what's happening? Right. I started thinking back about the send out cards event when I got there. Right. People were on stage and they had, I remember they had the CEO and the head tech guy get up and show them new features. And I was like, okay, we got it. Like this is the cool thing. Right. Steve Jobs, their big event, he'd always come out as Black Trillneck and he would show the thing. Right. So like we needed an event so we could show like what we were doing, what we were creating. Right. That's our thing about send out cards. Right. They had people who would come on stage, right. People and they would cry. They'd tell their story. Like that's what we need. Like we have our, our members come and talk and share their stories. Right. And they gave away awards. Like we need to have awards. Like this is how you create a movement. Right. And so we build an event that wasn't just like every other event, every other event at a time. There were a couple of versions. It used to be you have multi speaker, every single speaker get online or get on and they would each, everyone have a chance to sell and, and they call them pitch fest sometimes. But I was like, how events were back in the day, way back in the day. And then after the crash and it happened again, it was different. And I remember with TNC, they came in and, and they were on the whole event and maybe they might pitch one thing or sometimes they didn't pitch anything. They sold a lot more like sponsors and booths and stuff like that. And for us, I was like, I don't really want to be in the sponsor booth game. I want to be, I want people in the room. I want to be able to sell like coaching the next thing. Right. So it gave us ability to sell our coaching program and we gave us ability to highlight students and testimonials and find out who our people were. So we could go find those people and then later go to their homes and film them telling their stories and all sorts of stuff. Right. Like it just became the thing, like having the industry event. And so for you, if you really want to create a movement after you've written your book, the next phase, like you need to create an event, you need to be one putting the, like planning the flag and like, this is the thing. This is my event. And this is where people in our industry go. Even if like, you have no right of saying that initially, right? Like we didn't, we have TNC have three to 5,000 people at these events. We get the first one 600, right? They were way bigger than us. And we kept trying to get bigger and trying to get bigger. And eventually we got spot where we were similar. Like we were, we were three, 4,000 people there, three, 4,000 people and then COVID hit, right? Everything collapses, shrinks down. And then right after COVID, we both launched our events weeks. We didn't realize this when we launched it, but it just happened. Like there's this week, number one, ours week, number two. I was like, Oh man. And like now we're competing. Now people got to pick that we're going this one or this one, right? And so they do their event. And so I'm home just, it's just like this week, I'm here doing slides during the event and TNC is happening. And so, but we said much of our team down there to go check it out. And it's crazy. Look in the ballroom, there's, it was set for like 3000 people. And during the opening keynote, there are about 30, maybe 50 people in there, maybe a hundred people. My team has sent me a video. So I'm like, this place is empty. And I was like, Oh crap, we're in COVID. People are not going to come to events. Like we just saw that. I was so scared. And for us, like we spent so much money. It could have been really bad for us if people didn't show up because there's a lot of money that goes into events. There's a lot of things that you guarantee the hotel, like a room block, how many rooms you get. Like it can be a really expensive learning lesson. And anyway, but because like the people that came to the bottom of our funnel, like they are the crazy ones, the 1% crazy, the funnel hackers, like the most insane people, right? One week later, we go to ours, and it was packed from back to front, wall to wall. It is packed. And it was crazy. And I remember, I can't remember if it was that fun like you live in the next one, but Perry Belcher spoke at it. And then Perry messaged me, I messaged her afterwards. And he's like, congratulations, man, your event won. And I was like, Oh, I knew we were competing. I didn't know he knew we were competing. But he said that. And I was like, like for me, I was just like, we became the industry event. What, how do we do that? Right? So like coming back and it wasn't just like, let's make a convention and boost and speakers, like, let's create a movement, right? Like let's look at how network marketing and it's like how other ways didn't how do we, how do we bring those things in to make something that's really, truly special and different? That's what we do with funnel hacking live. And now we're 10 years into it. This is our 10th technique. It's our 11th one. So we did a virtual international one six months ago. So techniques are 11th. This is our FHL 10 the last dance. And it's weird because people have asked me, like, why would you stop this? Like, you're the industry event. You're the biggest one. Like, why would you stop this? It's weird because like we're stopping ours and our teens got canceled this year. They shut it down. Grant Cardone's got a huge event. His, he, this is his last year. He's kind of weird. Like, all of us are kind of ending the, these things. And I think a couple of reasons, number one is like, you know, if you're going to do an industry event, like it's a lot of work for us at the 10 month cycle. So we do the event. We have two months just like, Oh, and it's like, okay, back at it. Like we're up next one, sell the tickets, get the speakers, line it up. Like, it's a lot. And we've been doing it for a decade. And honestly, I'm tired. Number two is I'm working on something else. By doing the event we did, when we first launched funnel hacking live, like it was very unique. It was very different. People came like, this is not like normal events. This is not like anything else in their experience. Even the way we captured the way that we did our videos, like everything was different. And that was really special. And then over time, people started modeling us and funnel hacking us and copying us. Right. And now it's like 10 years later, looking like most events look like funnel hacking live. Like people understand like we figured out a formula, they're modeling it. And it's amazing. But like, this is the reality. Because I'm not done doing events by any stretch of imagination. I wanted something different. I wanted something better. But I need some time to reset. But funnel life is hard because we have a framework and things that people expect, right? So it's like, every year it's like that a little bigger, a little bigger, a little bigger, right? And for me to do what I want to do in the near future, to create the new industry event, it has to be different. And I had to reset. I couldn't just be FHL 11 now, because it's a little different. Like it needed to be a huge reset. I needed space and time to like rethink through it and how to make something amazing. So that's the reason why we're stopping funnel hacking live, but it's still part of the thing, right? Part of the movement, writing a book, creating an event. And that is how you build a movement. That's how we built ClickFun. So we would get spot now where we're, we're a software company is literally take on $0 in funding. We're the last of the, of our competitors to not take on money. All the rest sold out, right? We're the last ones who are sticking to the bootstrap story. And it's been amazing, right? We've passed a billion dollars themselves, three comma, three comma club award. Let's go. By the way, we did design it. I'm going to show you guys that funnel hacking live. So all you guys that make that a goal to go up to three comma club award, we did it because of these things, right? Obviously funnels are key, but we did with a front end book with a virtual or not virtual, but the live event, those are the two core things to actually create a movement. So that's what I want to share with you guys today. I hope that it helps get the wheels in your head spinning, right? Every mass movement was built initially with the book, right? All of them throughout time, throughout history, right? And then if you want to create this movement, you got to become like put your flag in the ground, like I'm going to become the industry event. This is where people come together. This is the spot when you do those two things. That's how you start finding your people and bringing them together. Now they've got the doctrine of the movement you are creating. They've got the people together. Again, give them a name, funnel hackers, whatever you want to call your people, call your people and then give them identity, have them come together and then you can serve them. And it's just a, it's, it's a, it's a fun, powerful, exciting thing. So I hope you guys enjoyed the episode. Hope you learned a lot. I go and kind of read one more ad because I'm here. This will be a fun one for me as well. This is for our selling online event, which is insane. We do this once a month and it's one of the best things I've ever done. It is virtual events. You can do it from the comfort of your home, but here you go. Here is the ad read. Here we go. Do you have a funnel, but it's not converting? The problem is 99% of the time it's, oh, let me fix this ad. Editors don't edit this. We'll keep it in so they can see me messing up. Okay. Okay. Do you have a funnel, but it's not converting? The problem 99.9% of the time is your funnel is good, but you suck at selling. If you want to learn how to sell so your funds will actually convert, then get a ticket to my next selling online event by clicking on link in the description or going to selling online.com slash podcast. Look at me reading ads. I got like a professional podcast host after what 1200 episodes, whatever. I'm finally, finally becoming like legit host. A lot of guys on my team have been listening to podcasts like, I don't like having to hear any other ads. I'm like, I know it's, it's okay, but these are cool companies with cool products and they're willing to host to promote a, to dump ad money into this. And it was cool for us. We take all the ad money and we use it to drive more people back to the podcast so it can continue to grow. So if you want to help me in the process, what I would love to do is tell people about new podcasts either on YouTube channel or on the podcast or both share with other people. That's how you can help serve me selfishly back for any of the stuff I'm giving to you guys. And that way more people start listening to podcasts to get all the money makers and sponsors goes to 100% back into just promoting the podcast, getting more people on here so I can keep serving you guys because for me, like in my life right now, get everything's about impact. And so for me, it's like, if I'm going to spend an hour a day doing a podcast like this, like what's the return on investment? Like what does it look like? And for me, it's like how many listeners? And so as that number is growing and growing and growing, okay, I'm going to put more time, more effort, more energy into it. The podcast is huge right now. It's growing very quickly, which is awesome. YouTube channel is kind of more new. I've been doing YouTube stuff for a long time, but I've tried a lot of formats and I was like, I'm really enjoying this. So if you're listening, watching on YouTube, I know it's a different format. I was doing in the past and it's a little different from YouTube, but my goal is keep this going for a while and see if I can get you guys all on YouTube converted to like enjoying it and sharing it because if I can do that, then it's, it's anyway, it's pretty cool. So that's the idea. I appreciate you. Thank you for hanging out with me for this episode. If you liked it, again, let me know in the comments, share with a friend. I appreciate you guys. And for those of you guys who will be at Funnel Hacking Live, while the time this is live, she'll probably be done, but I'm excited to hang out with you guys and to serve you guys one last time for the biggest event in the world. And just know that I'm there. And again, it's the last of the Funnel Hacking Lives, but it's not the end of an era. It's the beginning of something amazing that will be coming very, very soon. I appreciate you all. Thank you guys so much for listening and we'll talk to you all soon. Bye.
