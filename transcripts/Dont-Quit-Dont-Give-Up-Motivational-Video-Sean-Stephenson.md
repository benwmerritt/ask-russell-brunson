## Transcript
How many people have ever made a video on YouTube or Facebook? And I know we had like 10 to 30 or 100 views and they kind of were pissed. Oh, I wish I had more visibility. Why are these 15 souls needed when you just sense? When the Coast Guard goes out in a stormy night to rescue a boat that is capsized, they bring their helicopter and they hover over top of the boat and they realize there's more people in the water than there's space in the helicopter. Who do they save? You know what their motto is? They can only save the people who swim toward us. I can only help those that swim toward me. You will go nuts if you try to help people that do not want your help. But claim that they do. The moment you try to help somebody and they push you back and push you back, you have to say, look, you know what, I love you. I'm going to be over there. Hopefully you'll swim toward me at some point. If you don't, this helicopter is leaving. The quickest way for you to drown is to try to help somebody that's swallowing around in the water or that's swimming away from you. When there's all these people that are actually wanting to swim toward you. You know those 15 likes on that YouTube video of yours? They're the ones swimming toward you.
