I'll give you a million dollars right now for it. And the person's like, but everyone else says it's worth 150. Why would you give me a million dollars? For me, like there's this Rembrandt and the Attic. Rembrandt and the Attic, the Rembrandt and the Attic. Rembrandt and the Attic, Rembrandt and the Attic. There's a Rembrandt and the Attic. What did you just say? What did you just say? During today's episode, we are going to be talking about a concept I call the Rembrandt and the Attic. If you ever thought about like, why in the world do big companies buy other companies, right? Facebook is a really good example. Facebook's bought a lot of companies, like Instagram and SpaceLots has, but they bought like Oculus. Like why would they have bought that? And now it's becoming like everything, right? It's the meta versus the future. You have other companies like Coca-Cola buying monster. You have Salesforce buying Slack. Like why would they make these acquisitions, right? And so you see this happening at a big, huge scale, but it's also happening at a small scale that every one of us, you and me can participate in and be part of, and it's going to be happening every single day. I'm going to be showing you guys behind the scenes of some of the companies that we're buying and acquiring and why we're doing it. Talk about why I've spent five or $6 million on old books and how it opens up a whole new world of things for you. You can start seeing opportunities in a whole bunch of different places you probably never saw them before. And I think this is going to be an episode you are going to love. So my intention for you guys during this episode is you're going through it. And so when you start thinking for yourself, like how could I do this? Why are you looking at literally companies? Like look at ClickFones. If I was buying ClickFones, what would I do? Look at Monster. What would I do? If I would buy Facebook tape, what would I do? If I was to go buy, you know, whatever your favorite companies, your brands are like, what would you do if you were to buy those things? Like what would it look like? What would be the Rembrandt and the Attic you could see that you can identify? They would make this more valuable to you than to anybody else on the planet.

With that said, let's have some fun on this episode of the Marketing Secrets podcast. You're listening to Marketing Secrets with your host, Russell Brunson. So the story of Rembrandt and the Attic, when people buy companies, you know, a lot of times a company will go for sale on the market and hopefully people look at it, maybe they'll low ball like, oh, it's worth 10 million, 10 million, whatever. Then someone comes in like, oh, that's worth $50 million. And why would one company be at 50 million when everyone else in the market's like, oh, it's only worth 10? The guy says, because that person who wants to spend 50 million knows there's a Rembrandt and the Attic. And I remember asking him like, what did you just say? He said, a Rembrandt and the Attic. I'm like, what does that mean? He said, well, imagine somebody is selling a house, right? And a bunch of people coming into the house they're looking at it's like, oh, the house is worth $100,000. Everyone's offering $100,000 to this house. Then someone comes in and they come out and they offer the person like, okay, I want this house. I'll give you a million dollars right now for it. And the person's like, but everyone else says it's worth 150. Why would you give me a million dollars? And the person's like, I just want to pay a million dollars for it. So the guy signs on the house, he gets a house, spends a million dollars, buys a house. And what the homeowner and all the other people didn't know is that if you went and searched in the Attic of the house there's actually an original Rembrandt painting which was worth $100 million sitting up there. So the person who recognized the Rembrandt and the Attic, they saw that it was worth way more to them and they were willing to spend more because they knew what to do with it. And so for you right now, I want you to understand that there are so many, like we're in this crazy era with recession hitting and things shutting down. There's companies for sale right now. There's opportunities to partner with people. There's like so many things that are happening right now where there are literally these assets that are super, super cheap. But if you have the mindset, like you understand marketing and sales and funnels and traffic and distribution where you can come in and recognize the Rembrandt and the Attic and get an insane deal, that could be huge for you. I was thinking about just like another example to kind of help you guys see this and the example I want to share is Shark Tank. And maybe it's because we're actually working on a project right now, Damon John. So I've been like thinking, I've been watching more Shark Tank and like getting back in that mindset. But it's interesting is each Shark on Shark Tank has different skill sets. You know that Damon is like the guy who built Fubu and so he understands retail and clothing and things that are really, really well. And then you got Mark who's like the tech guy who's built big tech companies. And you got Lori who's in QVC. You got Robert who's good at security. Like all their own little thing. And so when some entrepreneur comes to pitch the sharks on Shark Tank, like here's the offer. You know, if it's like a gadgety thing, Damon's gonna be like, I don't do that, right? But Lori's like, oh my gosh, I know like battle-selling QVC. Like I'll give you a million dollars for, you know, half the company, because I know that in 50 seconds I can call a phone, get you on QVC and we're rich, right? Or someone brings us a new clothing line and everyone else is like, why? Like, you know, Mark Cuban's like, why would you do that? It doesn't make any sense. But for Damon, like there's a rim around the attic. Damon knows like, oh my gosh, I know, if I call this person right here, I get in retail and we'll make a hundred million dollars in like 25 seconds, right? Because he understands that. But each Shark has a distribution channel that they know they understand and they master. So when the product comes to them, they say like, I understand this distribution channel. Like plug it in, it just takes off really quickly. Okay, so for you as an entrepreneur, like there's a lot of these different things you can become good at. Like I just look at like the three books are here, like Dock on Secrets, Expert Secrets, Traffic Secrets. Like if you get any of these, like let's say you find a business that's got a really, really good product, really good sales, letter sales, video, webinar, whatever, but like they're not making much money. It's like, well they need more traffic. Well if you are really good at traffic, you can come in and like take this company's making almost no money, but you like, they have all the right assets, right? They've got this rim around the attic. They've got an amazing product, amazing sales pitch, but they just can't get traffic. So if you're a company or a partner or a choir or whatever it is, and also you bring the traffic and boom, overnight you can have a success. Or maybe a company's got really good traffic, but their conversions are lower, sales are lower. It's like, well they need a funnel or oh they need somebody to help build a webinar, whatever it is, like you have these skill sets you can find these deals and by bringing in these talents, you can dramatically grow the company. As you guys know over the last couple of years, so we've been buying a lot of different companies and people are always asking like, why did you buy that? Why did you spend that much money? It doesn't make any sense to me. Also in the last, less than a year, since last funnel hacking live, those of you watching the video, right now I'm in the Napoleon Hill room. I have all these first edition Napoleon Hill books and other books. Last year we were looking, I spent between five and $6 million in books in the last year. There's probably, I don't know, we guys think three, 4,000 books between all these different rooms in here. And people are like, why are you doing that? You're so dumb, you're buying old books, like there's no value in them. But they don't understand, it's like I know something they don't know. I understand what I can do with these books. I understand how the public domain works. I understand republishing, I understand how NFTs, how they can work with public. I think there's some things I understand. And so I wanted to share some of these stories with you guys just to get the will to head spinning. So you can start looking at the skillset that you have acquired, that you have learned. Or like, I need to learn the skills, I need to learn traffic so I can go and plug in these other companies. Or whatever those things are, just to help. Honestly, I want you guys to flex your mental muscles and strengthen these muscles so you can start seeing these opportunities everywhere. Okay? Magnetic Marketing, so Dan Kennedy's company. A lot of you guys know, last year we acquired it. It was so much fun for me. It's been a great thing. But reality is like, why would I bought that company? Right? Like I have an info publishing company. I've got a bunch of books, I have software. I have these things like, why would I buy Dan Kennedy's company? Right? And if you look at it, you know, back in the day when Bill Glazer had it was killing it, it was making much money, but then it was sold to this PE firm who kind of ran out of the ground. And when you look at all of a sudden done, like when I had a chance to acquire the company, it wasn't worth a lot of money. You'd be shocked how much I was able to acquire the company for. So was able to acquire the company, but why would I, like still, like why would you do that? Now you have all this, you know, you've got more staff, more people. Like why was it worth it to you? And for me, it was like, well, like I know that the way we've grown ClickFunnels is by having these front end offers. Right? It's like dot com seekers, experts, seekers, traffic seekers, these books people would buy, they come in and we sell them ClickFunnels on the back end. Right? And that's how we grew ClickFunnels. But for me, it's like, we wanted to figure out how do we create more non-Russell based front end? So by buying my net marketing, I was able to buy, I mean, Dan Kennedy's written 40 something books. Like I have 40 potential front ends we could do, but also like looking through the archives, like we found like seven years of old faxes he had sent. I found all these courses are unpublished. There were so much, like there's so much value in here. Like all these Rembrandts and the attic, just the Google Drive we got from the company when we acquired it. Like there's hundreds of millions of dollars in value in there if you know what to do with it. Right? If I understand how to publish, how to republish, how to do these kinds of things. Like there's so much value there that all of a sudden it's like, I buy this thing for not that much money, but because we now we have assets that are going to be front ends for our, for our company, they'll be back ends are going to be bonuses for things. Like I'm literally flying out an hour to go fly to Dean Grossi's office. We're participating in their big product launch. I'm trying to figure out how do I get everyone to buy through me versus all the other affiliates. I'm like, well, let me look at Dan's hard drive. I go through hard drive and there's this course in there that's just like, no one's ever seen, no one's ever heard of it. And so I took this course. It was a three day event dance, we'll pretend $1000 and now I can offer as a bonus. And we'll probably, I don't know, we'll make, I don't know, six, seven figures in affiliate commissions because I knew that there was this bonus in a folder, this Rembrandt and the attic I was able to use and leverage that way. And there's like dozens of things like that just inside the magnetic marketing business. This is something we haven't talked about publicly too much. A lot of you guys know Brandon and Katelyn Poland. They are some of our biggest success stories inside of ClickFunnels. They built this huge movement called Lady Boss and over the last year or so they decided to shut the company down. They were ready to retire. They made a lot of money and Katelyn wanted to be a mom and Brandon wanted to kind of start another business. So they decided to shut the company down. And it was interesting because you may look at me and like Russell, like you sell business stuff. Why would you have bought Lady Boss? And the reason why is I looked at it and it was like there's five or six Rembrandts in the attic that other people aren't seeing. My question is like let's say you were to buy Lady Boss, the company, what would you do with it? Right, there's 1.9 million people on the email list, 700,000 people, 700,000 supplement buyers on the list. They've got all the info products, the supplements. They spent three years building coaching curriculum to coach somebody for three years on a weight loss journey. They have sales script and how they sell it. Again, all these things like there's so many Rembrandts in that business. If I connect them with this person here, this person here, we can launch this business in a different way and grow it dramatically. Another good example is the last podcast episode I believe I talked about Doodly. How we bought the Doodly, Toodly, that company as well. One of the big reasons why we bought that company is because the way they structure their sales funnel, the point where they were getting 500,000, excuse me, not 500,000, 500 buyers a day coming into their world. And recently we found another company, another software company for sale, that it's this funnel simulation software and we'll talk about that in future episodes. But I saw that software and it was doing good, but not great, but I was like, if I just take that software and if I build the funnel to match the same funnel structure that Doodly.com has, if I model that funnel structure, I can take this funnel simulation software from 30 or 40 sales a day to 300, 400 sales a day overnight just by restructuring how the funnel looks and then cranes the new ads and relaunching it. And so we looked down and it was like, oh my gosh, like right now they're struggling to sell this company, but like for me, like there's this Rembrandt in the act because I know exactly how to shift from 30 sales a day to 300 sales a day. I know exactly how to take those people now and put them into click funnels. And suddenly I think it becomes so valuable for me, right? Because like I know what I'm gonna do with it. Again, this is for me to just help you guys start flexing your mind. Like I started buying these books and again, most people I know were like, this is crazy, why would you keep buying these old books? What's the purpose? Like there's like put it on a, to put in a bookshelf or to put it on a glass and show people. And yes, that's part of the strategy. There's a thing called the public domain. Some of you may have heard of it, but public domain is when something was created and the copyright expires. And so any book or work, so it could be art, it could be movies, it could be TV, it could be music, film, audio, anything that was published before 1923 in America is automatically in the public domain. In fact, it's interesting if you look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney's entire company was built off public domain things. There were books that were written back in the early, in late 1800s, early 1900s, like Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, like Walt Disney didn't write those stories, there were stories that were in the public domain, he took them and then he wrote movies and created movies out of them and built the Disney empire. So anything published before 1923 in America is automatically in the public domain. You can take those things, you can republish them. From 1923 to 1963, and I'm gonna mess up the numbers here, but is when the copyright laws changed, something had to be renewed during those, from 1923 to 1963, if the copyright was renewed, it's still copyrighted, but if it wasn't, then it's in the public domain. And they assume that only, I think, 7% of works were ever republished, so anything between 1923 to 1963 that the copyright was renewed is in the public domain. So all these works, all these books are in the public domain and you can start reselling them, right? You can republish them, you can use them for courses, for podcasts, for books, for bonuses, like there's a million things you can do with it, right? And so as I started this journey, we started finding these books that were super rare that nobody has, in fact, I went and bought this Napoleon Hill First Edition Laws of Success and we flew out there, to meet with the guy, I ended up buying his entire collection and part of the collection was 250 pages of these hand-type stuff in Napoleon Hill. And I remember going through them, I'm like, this is really, really cool. And the guy who I bought it from told me, he's like, I used to charge people $10,000, they'd come to my house for a day and they would just read these things and then I make them leave. And so when we got that stuff back here, I started going through it and what I realized is that, literally, these 250 pages were an unpublished book that Napoleon Hill wrote that he'd never published. No one's ever seen before. And I have the only copy of the manuscripts of this book and it's all in the public domain. So it's like, I'm able to take this and I can republish it. Like how many guys would go crazy to buy an unpublished book from Napoleon Hill? And no one has seen ever, right? Directly from his type, I have these things and we can turn that into money. I can turn it into a hook to get somebody to join a continuity program or newsletter. Or like, there's a million ways I can republish that, right? Logan Paul, I saw he bought a Pokemon card. He wore it on WWE in his Pokemon card and seeing like, why would you spend $6 million on this Pokemon card, right? He's using it, he's building the value of it by telling the story and like bringing it out. But also now, this thing worth $6 million worth more. What you can do now, and he's with NFTs, you can sell partial ownership, right? I've been studying this as well because people have been doing this a lot with paintings now or these rare paintings that are worth $30 million. Most people can't buy a $30 million painting, right? But paintings beat the S&P like 14X, I believe, or 10X or something crazy like that, right? Old books beat the S&P, I think, by seven or eight X. Old Mormon books, by the way, beat it by 40X. And so I've spent multiple million dollars in old Mormon books and like, so those are valuable to me. They're beating the stock market, but most people aren't gonna buy $6 million NFT. They're not gonna buy a $30 million painting. They're not gonna buy a million dollar old, $150,000 old first edition Book of Mormon or a doctor in a Covenants or these things are expensive. So like, I have the first edition of Laws of Success that cost me a million and a half dollars. It's the only edition on the planet, signed by Napoleon Hill. And again, most of them aren't gonna spend $1.5 million, but hey, did you know that you can invest 1500 bucks for an NFT and you own one 100th of this thing? And as the value of it goes up over time, your NFT value goes up over time. So I can sell fractional ownership to a book, to a painting, to a Pokemon card, things like that. The core point of this podcast is just for all of you guys, is the more skill sets you get, especially in the marketing game, like then more Rembrandt's and the Attic pop up when you become a good marketer and anything else in the world, right? Because if you get good at marketing in your business, that's amazing, but then it's like, oh, this business is for sale. Or I told you this before right now, there's so many, because we're going to a recession, a lot of people who don't want their business, their business aren't profitable and they're just shutting them down because they can't sell them in a traditional way. So you can go to these people who are starting shutting their business down or they're struggling and say, hey, I wanna buy your business, I'll give you $100,000 for the business, but I'm not gonna give you any money right now, I'm gonna finance this. And so like from the profit I make, I'll pay you back 10 grand a month for the next, you know, 10 months, whatever it is, and that's how I'll buy your business. And those deals are there all day, every single day, where you can pick up the business. Again, for you, there's a Rembrandt and like, oh my gosh, I know that my list would love to buy this thing so I could do it through a venture or I could just acquire the business, promote it and pay it off. Literally with the Dan Kennedy offer, when we bought Magnetic Marketing, we bought the company, we created a funnel, we launched it to our list, we got all the cash, we paid it off and now everything moving forward is complete pure profit, right? And so like there's so many deals like that when you start understanding these principles. So even if you're in the spotlight, I don't have a business yet, so I can't figure out all the different pieces, that's okay, like the skills that you guys are learning are so, so, so, so valuable. If you just focus on traffic, if you just focus on funnels, if you just focus on, you know, on webinars or cellular telecom stories and you master that piece and start looking for different opportunities out there that don't have that piece. They have the other things, but they're missing that one piece, right? Or maybe you find somebody who's really good at traffic, you find somebody who's really good at funnels and you just become the middle person like setting up these deals, right? Like Damon John is not going out there making the phone calls to go get distribution in all these different clothing lines, right? But he's like, I gotta do, he does that, I gotta do, he does that, I gotta do, you know, do that, whatever. You got different people who do things. He knows that all I have to do is if I say yes to this deal, I call three people and now this is in 3,000 stores. He's the same thing for you, like, I don't know how to get traffic, but this is the guy who's really good at traffic, this person who's good at funnels, I find this deal, take over the deal, make two phone calls, can you do the funnel, you do traffic, I'll give each a piece of the pie and then boom, all of a sudden, now you're in business. And so this is the stuff I want you guys thinking through. So my goal for this podcast episode, literally my notes here says I want you guys exercising, flexing the muscles in your brain, what would you do? So start looking at deals, like think about the Lady Boss deal we bought, right? Think about Doodly, think about magnetic marketing. Like if you were to buy that company, what would you do? It all starts there, right? What would you do? Okay, look at another company, like what's the company in your market, they say on it is a really cool supplement. What would you do if you bought on it? What would you do if you bought Success Magazine? What would you do if you bought an old book on eBay? Like what would you do? And then start that exercise and it's gonna get the wheels in your head spinning and start realizing like, oh my gosh, like I learned this over here, I learned this over here, I could do this, I could do this, I could do this, and as you start doing that, these muscles in your brain are gonna get smarter. Okay, if you were to buy ClickFones, what would you do? I wanna ask you guys that question, think about it. If you own, if I give you the keys to ClickFones, congratulations, you're the owner, what are you gonna do? What would you do? What would it look like? How would you make it better? What would the structure be? How would you try to grow cells? How would you try to like start thinking through these things and start opening up all these things for you? So that's kind of the goal I want you guys to start looking at is just flexing these muscles in your brain so when the opportunities show up, when you're out looking at houses and you look at the attic and also you see a $100 million rembrandt that you were able to go execute on it, take that opportunity and run with it. Because you don't want to be a person who walks and looks around and goes, no, it's only worth 100 grand and leave when the thing's worth $100 million. Okay, those opportunities are around you every single day and your skills that gives you the ability to capitalize on it and have success. So with that said, you guys, I hope you enjoyed this episode.
