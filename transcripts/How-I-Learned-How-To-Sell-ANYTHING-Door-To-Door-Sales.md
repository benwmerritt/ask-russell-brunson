Hey, I got a really bold statement to make. That is before you learn Facebook ads, YouTube ads, Instagram, or any kind of marketing. In fact, even before you start building funnels, I would highly recommend the very first thing you do is this. Door-to-door sales. And yes, I have a lot of experience with this. I wasn't selling cut-co-knives or encyclopedias. I was doing this for two years selling a religion, which is probably the hardest product you could ever possibly sell. My pitch is you have to give up alcohol, tobacco, coffee, tea, any premarital, extramarital sex, and 10% of your income for the rest of your life in exchange for salvation if you don't mess it up. So after doing that, selling pretty much anything else door-to-door is really easy. Anyway, on to the video. My name is Russell, and first off, make sure you click on the button down below to subscribe and turn on your notifications, that way you can get this video and all the other ones every time they come out new. Mark Cuban, Sarah Blakely, George Clooney, Grant Cardone. What do all these people have in common? Every single one of them got their start going door-to-door, knocking on the door, ringing the doorbells, and trying to sell something to somebody. It's one of the best ways to start learning how to communicate with people, how to figure out how to sell your product, your service, or yourself to somebody you meet as a complete stranger. You guys remember this video that went viral like 10 years ago? Because Stevie Wonder says, seeing is believing, and I got a disease called enthusiasm, so I'm going to cut straight to the mustard. Watch this, though. Don't laugh too hard because the neighbor's going to see this black kid scrubbing your window, okay? But look, wax on, wax off by Mr. Miyagi. Remember the karate kid? Now that guy's name is Kenny Brooks, and Kenny put in over 10,000 miles on his feet door-to-door-to-door, learning and mastering the skill. But what he did next was actually like the real genius. What he did, actually I'll tell you that at the very end of the video, he was amazing. But before we get to that, I want to walk you through how door-to-door sells can help you to build a stronger brand. Connect better with your audience, learn how to make more sales, and a whole bunch more. Alright, number one is you have to face fear head-on. Now, I don't know about you, but I'm super introverted, and me going to talk to somebody, like face-to-face, scares me to death. When I started going door-to-door, I had to do that. I had to walk up the door of a stranger. I'd know who they were, if they had a dog behind their thing, they wanted to bite me, whatever. Take a deep breath and knock on that door, knowing what I was going to share with them was something that could change their life. The very first time I ever did a door approach, I had someone who was with me who was a trainer. And so, I assumed they were going to train me for two or three weeks and show me the ropes and how it all worked. So, I walked to the very first door and he knocked on the door and he did the door approach. I kind of watched, I was like, oh, they're cool. Went to the next door and he knocked on the door and he stepped aside and pushed me in front of the door. I looked at him like, wait, what's going on? And then he just closed his mouth and sat there. And the door opened, and this lady came out. The guy next to me didn't say a word. And I was like, hi. And I don't remember what I was saying. I was stumbling over trying to remember what he had said last time. And I was mumbling some things out. And she looked at me for probably four to five seconds and then she slammed the door on my face. And I looked at the guy who was supposed to be training me and I was so mad. And he just started laughing and laughing and laughing. That was the very first time that I ever did a door approach. It was so scary. But through that process, I learned how to embrace the fear. And realized that worst case scenario, they shut the door. Best case scenario, we have a conversation. We can sell them a product or service. It could actually change their life. I remember after the door got slammed on my face, at first I was like, oh, no, I lost the sale. I was frustrated and scared. And I realized there's another 100 houses down the street. And I realized it's just a numbers game. The person says, no, that's fine. Let's go to the next one. I was super concerned that I was going to mess up the pitch. And I had to get perfect for every single person. And that's just not the reality. It's just a numbers game. Number two, learning how to take no for an answer really, really fast. When I started my journey door to door, again, I wasn't selling products. I was talking about my religion. And I thought that I was going to get everybody excited to hear from me. I was like, they're going to be so excited to see me. And the reality was they weren't. It was like door slam people cursing at you, people flipping you off, people saying words I never even heard before. Over and over and over again. And at first I was like trying to convince people and trying to find them at the doorstep. And I came to a point in our lives, look, I'm not for everybody. We got to figure out who are the people who actually want our products and our services. Our goal is to get to know as quick as we can so we can move to the next door, move to the next house, keep putting in the miles until we find the person who's ready and the person who's actually going to say yes. A lot of people in business, when they get somebody who says no, they get all the anxiety to ask them for a deal or for a partnership or to buy their product or to sell their product, whatever it is. And the person says no. They have so much fear behind it. It happens. Sometimes it like debilitates them. Like crippling debilitation for days where they're hiding in their office or they don't come back to work because they feel so bad about it. Going door to door and having this experience where you're hearing no over and over and over and over again, it strengthens those muscles up. We'd rise, they're not saying no to you. Like they don't care about you at all. They're saying no to the product and that's okay. Let's move on to the next person. With door to door, you don't have days or weeks to recuperate, right? Like depending on how big the lawn is, like you could be 30 seconds to maybe 2 minutes before the next door approach and you got to be ready to go again. Which means you got to flush out all the negative emotions, get back in state and try again. I think this is such an important skill to have today, especially when you're building funnels. Because as you know, you're one funnel way. You don't know if it's going to be the first one or the second one or the third one. That's why we got to keep doing it. Go to the next door approach, knock on the door. Go to the next one. Build your next funnel. Build your next funnel until you find the one that's going to work for you and the one that you're going to work for you. And the one that is your one funnel way story. Number three, you have a chance to begin to find your voice. When I first started going door to door, I had like some scripts that people had that I tried to learn to memorize and I would go to the first door and I'd try to regurgitate the script and slam the door in the next one and the next one kept happening. And so I started to figure out how do I make this my own? How do I weave my own language? Like what would I do if someone came to me at the door? Like how would I approach it? What would they have to say to me for me to open the door? And so it gave me this chance to kind of like change my pitch, to change my messaging, to change my introduction. Instead of saying, hi, my name is Russell Brunson. They open the door and be like, hey, I noticed your yard. Look at your kid. Something where he started in a conversation. You have a chance to keep tweaking that pitch over and over and over again. And you know, one day goes to a week, goes to a month, goes to a year. And by the time you've been doing this for a year, you know your message. You know exactly what gets people to open the door as opposed to slam the door. You know what things to say to get people to invite you in versus the things you say to get people to run away. And you look at me. I'm a shy introverted kid. The very first time I got on stage, I didn't dare to even speak. I was like shivering. I was so scared to death. And now fast forward 15 years later after doing this over and over and over again, I can stand in front of 35,000 people and feel completely comfortable. Because I understand how to do the message, not just what to say. Let me show you a video the very first time I ever spoke on stage. This is a lot bigger group than I had planned. And I figured about 15, 10 or 15 people. So this will make it a lot more fun. If you guys have questions along the way, raise your hand, ask them. Afterwards, if you have long questions, we'll be out and around for a couple of hours. So be sure to grab me either anytime during the weekend or tonight. And we'll try to answer them. And here's a video a couple years later, my chance to speak in front of 35,000 people. This is amazing. First off, I want to thank Grant and his entire team for allowing me to be here and share my message with all of you guys. This is insanely cool. Notice the message was the same, but how I delivered it completely different. Number four, you get to learn about your customers. Now a lot of times us internet marketers think we're so smart because we got Facebook. We have these algorithms that tell us all about our customers, right? But I promise you, you will learn more about your customers by listening and then from that conversation, figuring out how does your product or service become the solution to the problems that they're having. That's a thousand times more powerful than any algorithm that Zuckerberg could ever create. When you're speaking to people, you can notice like their body language, their head nodding up and down. Are they laughing with you? If you're telling a joke, does it land? If you're telling a story, are they wandering? Are they looking on their phone? Are they actually paying attention and engaged? Just watching their reactions is almost like a live feedback loop where you can listen, you can judge, you can listen. You can adjust your script, make the tweaks and the changes on the fly as they're happening. Even if somebody says no, it gives you the ability to practice different angles, different directions. A lot of times you can turn those no's into yes's. Imagine taking that information, the things you're learning face to face with real humans and then taking it online. Imagine how much further along you're going to be than those who are struggling just hoping they guess the right message. And number five, it gives you marketing stamina. If you think about it, burnout rate with online businesses is really high, right? People start a business, they fail, they try, they give up and things like that. I got really good hearing no over and over and over again. They weren't rejecting me, they were rejecting the product and I was okay moving and keep doing that. It's kind of like going to a gym, right? You go to the gym every single day, you get stronger and stronger and stronger to the point where you can handle heavier things. Where some people jump in online business, they've never done things like that. And the first time any kind of adversity happens or they get fear or they get someone who says no, they just walk away. The stats show that most people only last between two and four weeks going door to door. Which means that they're marketing muscles, their stamina is not very high. I had to do it for two full years, which is why my marketing muscles today are so strong. Where's the next door? Let's go. So those are my biggest lessons that I got from going door to door for two years. And now Kenny Brooks, he went door to door for over 10,000 miles before he created a video that went viral. And now guess what he's done? He took all the things he learned by from going door to door step by step. He took all the information. He's literally selling the secrets to door to door selling online through a funnel for crying out loud. How cool is that?
