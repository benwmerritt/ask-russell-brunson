Hey, this is Russell again and welcome back to part two of my exciting interview with Ty Lopez and me. Excited to have you guys here. If you have not yet subscribed, make sure you're subscribing so you can get the first episode as well as all the future episodes coming out of this amazing interview. Now, today's interview was kind of fun. This is Ty's interview and me started asking about like, how do people launch funnels? How does it work? And so I tell a story here at the very beginning that you are going to love about one of our ClickFunnels members who basically went and said, I'm going to launch a funnel every single week until one of these things blows up. He launched the first one, the second one, the third one, the fourth one, the fifth one, and then something amazing happened. And I'm going to let you watch that in the interview because I don't think you're going to believe me until you see it here. I know Ty didn't believe me. And then the very end of this segment, I actually show a really cool way where you can build a membership site, even if you don't create a single video, a single product, single anything just by copying and pasting. When I shared this, you saw Ty's mind just go, boom, he's excited and you're going to be excited as well. So with that said, let's jump into part two of the interview and hopefully you love it. And again, if you do like this, subscribe and share this with other people and I will see you in the interview. I want to throw this at you and get your opinion because number two for me would be the ability to test new concepts. I have such a good story on this. Let's hear. I'm so excited. Okay. So one of our members is actually right now the person who's processed the most money inside of ClickFunnels. I know you guys are gaming or working, not gaming, working to beat. Yeah, we're going to beat them. You're going to beat them. But the guy right now who's got the record, his name is Trey Llewellyn. And what Trey did is he came to ClickFunnels and I met him right afterwards and he was selling t-shirts at the time through, I can't remember, t-shirt sites. And he's like, I'm going to use ClickFunnels. I don't know what my thing is, but I'm going to launch a funnel every single week till one of them works. And he's like, oh, yes, this first thing he put out there, he launches it and it was just like, ah, next thing we put out there and launched it. T-shirts. Initially it was t-shirts and those were kind of okay. And he tried a couple other things and some started out as some marginal success. And one thing he tried to sell in his past were these flashlights. He had a literally huge closet full of flashlights. And one week they're like, what should we build this week? He's like, let's build a flashlight funnel. And so they got a flashlight that took pictures of them and his buddy, they were joking and like, we should call these survival flashlights because this is like the cool new things. They put like survival flashlight and they launched a survival flashlight. It was like funnel like eight or nine in this thing, right? Launched that flashlight funnel and in like a two month period of time, there's $20 million in these survival flashlights. Two months? I had no idea. It's the biggest funnel we've ever, I've ever seen in my entire life. Like blew up and just went crazy. So it's like, but he couldn't, like for me, before we had click funnels, it took us on average about three months. I had eight full time developers and designers takes three months to get one funnel out, right? Yeah. And so, and we would do so we'd about one every single quarter, so four a year and usually one out of four would work. So three out of four would completely fail. So one a year we're hoping for a home run, they'll pay for the rest of the year, which tray like he was in one a week. Like now in our team, we always, we spent a lot of time thinking about the idea and then we actually sit down to build it. We usually get done within an hour to an hour and a half, the whole entire thing. So you can go from idea so fast. So people watching because I feel like people get stuck still. People are still in the old, old modality of business, which is think the thing through, write an elaborate business plan, raise capital, hire, you know, a team by the time. Yeah. One year later, go broke, have a great story about how you went broke and do this. And by the time you're 96 years old, you're wealthy. And what you're saying is you've condensed the cycle. Test the market. You can have a business up running, fail or succeed within 24 hours. The same way. So the way this tray guy, the way he did his test, he, I kid, this is a real thing. He would walk across you to Walmart and you walk around the aisles. He's like, this looks like it would sell. He'd take it off the shelf, go back home, take a picture, make a funnel and it didn't work. So he'd walk away with the ones that did work. Then he would go and like find some of China's source, like whatever, all the things to get the actual product. But he wasn't spending all sorts of time and money ahead of time. He's just like going to Walmart, find out what looked cool, try to sell it. If it's sold, if the market's like, yes, I want to give you money for that. Then he's like, okay, I'm actually building something behind that. If it didn't, he's out to 30 bucks. He's thinking about it Walmart and an hour at this time. So it's like you can get speed so much faster going through this process. He or she who experiments the most wins. Have you done any paid advertising and what have you learned about that? Yes. So I'm going to tell a story that kind of sets us up though. But so when ClickFone's launched, start growing really fast and it's been fun as we've got a whole bunch of VCs have come and try to give us money. And we haven't taken a penny on it. I don't want to, but it's always fun to let them come talk to you and tell you what I think you're worth. It makes you feel good about yourself. Right? So you guys come and talk to us and sort of lunch one day and one of the VCs guys is asked all his questions, our numbers and try to put him out there. And he asked the same question they asked every single time on Shark Tank, right? Cuban's always like, so what's the cost to acquire a customer? Every single time on Shark Tank. And so he asked me, what's your cost to acquire a customer? And I was like, well, right now we spend about $120 on Facebook ads to get a free trial. And I was like, oh, he's getting all excited by doing them. I think so we're going to check $50 million and get this many customers as they actually know what we turned all the ads off. And he's like, why did you turn the ads off? And I was like, well, because I'm paying this out of my own pocket. Like this is me bankrolling this like like we're homegrown like and he's like, well, how are you guys growing so fast? I don't understand. And I said, well, this whole funnel thing that we're doing, we're like we practically we preach and he's like, well, walk me through the process. So I walk him through like, for example, my book, right? This is this is the funnel like that gets people into my world. Right? Selling the book. Yeah. So on average, now it costs about $12 on Facebook ads to sell one copy of the book. And some buys the book, we have enough self for the audio book and there's a training program behind it. Do you do the book free? It's free. They discover shipping handling. Okay. And then you have a couple upgrades. Yep. And so on average, we send $12 to sell a book, but I make $32 in the funnel. Hmm. So everyone buys the book. I met $20 that goes in my pocket and I get a customer and I tell a customer, hey, there's a really cool thing over here. They can call click funnels and then they go to click funnels. So I explained to the VC guy and he's like, that doesn't make any sense. I said, yeah, I get paid $20 net to introduce him to my company. Hmm. And I explained three or four times and I remember the fourth time afterwards he said, that's true. Like that'll change business forever. Right? I said, that's exactly what my whole message is like these funnels make it so that people like me who don't have any money, I don't have to go, you know, get some venture capital. It's got to give me $10 million, $100 million to bankroll and finance the growth. Like I create a funnel providing value to people. It gives me customers and then I introduce them to my thing. I'm really selling. So one of the lessons is create an introductory product instead of trying to go. It's kind of like you meet a girl. Let's say you want to get married. I was just watching the office. Andy Bernard is a dude who's always trying to get married and he got has no game because he basically goes straight for marriage within. Same with Michael Scott. So what you're saying is go on a date, get your customer to go on a date with you. So book, what else have you seen do well? Books are the hardest because writing books is tough, right? So a lot of people are like, I can't write a book. So that's tough. An easier one. One of my favorite ones I've done for us is I have a podcast as well. And I just took like my favorite episodes from podcasts and I put them on a USB drive and I had a couple of other audios and I did free plus shipping like this USB drive. It's got all my best podcast episodes plus these three other things you can't get anywhere else. And that do as well as that. It did. Yeah. In fact, the best one we've ever done. This is ridiculous. So we have there's just one sales script. I do a web. The way I do my webinars is a script behind it. It's like one piece of paper script. Okay. And there's a CD that explains the script and that one took me an hour to record the CD and I printed a piece of paper. That's the best one we've ever had. Wait, so let me know. I walk with a piece of paper. What? It's filming you holding a piece of paper. What they buy, they're buying is a piece of paper with the CD that explains the paper and that out converted all my books. What does the piece of paper say? One word? It's the sales script for how it's how I structure my webinars. Oh, and it's like kind of a drawing. Step one, step two, step three. It's a drawing. It's a doodle drawing. Just like I doodle all my stuff in the book. So it's a doodle drawing and the CD explains it. That one out converted any book, anything I've done took me an hour to make the whole thing. I did another one. It was pretty cool. Okay. It's kind of a stealth though. But this is if you guys are really lazy and you just want to use this way. Everybody, close your ears. I want to hear this and don't want you to hear it. Okay. So I just went to YouTube and you can use any market. Let's say you want to be in the survival market, right? Go to YouTube and find like the 10 coolest survival videos and then sell like access to a membership site that has like the top 10 highest coolest survival videos on YouTube. You can look for them if you want. There's billions of videos. Good luck. Or give me a dollar. I will give you a membership site that has embedded the top 10 survival ones in the world. Because that's you're basically curating. Yes. So that's cool. You those of you listening could just get a compilation that you find of good content. Put it on your own website. There's nothing against the law of doing that. Yeah. They want you to there's an embed link on YouTube. Yes. They want you to and they don't care if you charge basically do you feel like who like I'm a big believer like who your dream customer like who do you actually want to sell stuff in the future. Can I use this idea? Yeah. It's all yours. No. It done. You're American. Bye. I got all I needed from this talk. We're going to shut down. We don't need you anymore. But even if you figure out like who's your dream customer and like what videos they actually want. And that way you get when you're going to Facebook or YouTube and you're buying ads. You get your dream customers raise their hand like I want survival videos and if you're just happen to sell a survival course or product. Now your dream customers are coming to you and they can introduce and all your whole product line like that. So say I'm Walton was doing this with Walmart before almost. Anybody who's doing these kind of free trial thingies now you go to the store you've never eaten their kind of corn dog frozen food. They give you a little free one and then you go this is good and you're 10 times more likely to buy. So you give them a teeny sample. You charge a small amount of money that to keep their credit card on file so you can one click like Amazon does two reasons one big one is one click up sells makes one click up sells really easy and click funnels and then number two is I want people that are that buy stuff. Yes. Right. I'm a big believer in like I've noticed this in my entire business is like people who buy stuff buy stuff. Right. And so like if someone's not willing to pay like five bucks to cover shipping handling on a book they're never going to give me 100 bucks a month of software. Yeah. And so I want to identify all the people coming to my site like who are the people are actually buyers who are actually legitimately going to play this game. Yeah. They play it's credit card outside. Okay. I will I will spend more time and energy marketing person. I'll get a better relationship because they're proving themselves as buyers. They call that winnowing the wheat from the chaff. So what you're basically saying is you have to have a filtration system with your customers and putting a payment wall. They call that fancy term for a credit card page differentiates. Now you're just getting people pouring into your site that are willing to pay. And then they get this in the mail and they for me for my business they read it and also like they build a relationship with me. They understand like the movement we're trying to build they understand like oh this is why I need to find like just so many good things like to educate a doctor and people at front. And then when you have those 200. 68 well 250 pages took you only 10 years.
