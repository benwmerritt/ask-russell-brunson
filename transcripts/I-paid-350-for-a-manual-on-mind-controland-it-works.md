What's up everybody? Welcome back to The Vault. Today I've got a really cool book from somebody who's very, very prolific during this time period and taught some things that literally almost every other personal development author started using. Like Napoleon Hill was using his teachings, other people you'd be aware of, and even nowadays a lot of people are using what he taught and they're acting like they invented it. So but it came originally from this guy here named Amil Koo and this book right here is one of his books. He's got a lot of really cool books. This one's called The Practice of Autosuggestion and this was a book that's about $350. So not super expensive but they are hard to find, especially in English. Originally these were written in French. This is the cover of the magazine he was in and I got some ads. He's actually selling the book which is really cool as well. I'll probably dive into the ads as well. But Amil Koo was one of the first people ever talked about this concept called Autosuggestion which is something that is very important to learn for your own personal development but also as you are persuading and influencing other people understand how suggestion, auto-suggestion work as well. There's a quote on this ad I'm going to share with you. This is one of the core things he has people say every single day. But before I get into exactly what that is, Amil always talks about is a concept called Autosuggestion. Amil Koo was like the first person to really talk about this and write books about it and teach about it. Nowadays we may call it affirmations or things like that but it's different the way that he taught it. So you think about this. Here's you as a human being right? All of us know that every single day by default like our heart beats right? You can't focus like you can't change that. Your heart's always going to beat right? Same thing with our lungs. Every single second or whatever our lungs feel there and they go down like these are things that happens out of our body that just happen all the time right? And the same thing happens in our brain. Our brain just gets thoughts and they pop up just like your heart beating just like your lungs breathing like thoughts just come right? So think about this we always have these thoughts. And so a lot of like what happens in personal elements like you have these thoughts pop up and sometimes thoughts are positive sometimes they're negative but what you can do is like is take that thought that's happening and like change it to positive thoughts right? Like this is the big they talk about in any kind of personal element right? Think and grow rich like think about things that you want to achieve think about things right? But now there's two other things that are happening that affect our subconscious mind right? And this is what's interesting because our subconscious mind is the thing that actually directs what we're going to be doing in our life right? First I'll talk about what's called suggestion because that'll help make auto suggestion make more sense. So so suggestion. So you think about this life as you're going through life there's always people that are suggesting things to you right? And it's everything from your parents they give you different beliefs they've had throughout their whole life. They say things right? It could be their beliefs about money or about weight gain or weight loss or about happiness or about their their belief or whatever it is right? But you hear these suggestions they get woven into your subconscious mind they become part of you right? Almost every movie every TV show who is the villain? Like the villain almost every single time is the evil rich billionaire right? It's always the entrepreneur is the bad guy in every movie and so like throughout time you watch a thousand different you know Disney movies and the entrepreneur is always the bad guy eventually like man entrepreneurs are bad guys like that becomes like a subconscious thing that's suggested to you from outside. There's always these suggestions happening okay? And they affect who we are okay? And then the third thing so we have our own thoughts that just pop up we have suggestions people have suggested stuff too so over time and then the third one that Emile talks about is auto suggestion right? And this one is the key this is where you are choosing the things that you want to put into your brain. So instead of just like I hear my parents say this I hear my friends say this I hear TV say this or music or whatever instead you're saying what are the things I want to be programmed in my subconscious mind? Let me auto suggest those things to me and then those will become my subconscious patterns okay? And so that's kind of the premise of almost all of Koo's work is all tied back to this is understanding the suggestions coming from the outside and they're just showing up right? Your thoughts are popping in you can actually choose what things you want to suggest upon your subconscious mind and by repeating them over and over and over again they will become the pattern and so that's the whole key right? And so what's fun about this ad it says let the Koo method cure you right? And so we're talking about here is like what is the thing that you're struggling with? It could be weight loss, it could be health, it could be struggle making money like in here he's got be healthy, be happy, be resilient. So what they do is they find inside of his books side of his work like what are the suggestions and thoughts that you're having right now they're keeping you and holding you back from having what you want in life. If you're not healthy you're not happy you're not rich you're not whatever your thing is right? They figure that out and then they start saying okay what are the suggestions we need to give our subconscious mind they're gonna rewrite they're gonna basically take these external suggestions and hold it back and get rid of those you know make sure these thoughts are just popping up randomly like we're actually choosing the thoughts we want and then we say these suggestions over and over and over again right? So again some people might call these positive affirmations right nowadays or Tony Robbins calls them incantations like you say the thing over and over in fact I remember going to my very first Tony Robbins event I remember we walked on fire it was insane and then he talked about incantations and Tony had all these phrases he'd say them over and over and over again he had everybody write their own script like you know and like Tony would have you like march around like hear yourself in the chest and like say these things and yell them out loud drowning out all the other noise coming into your brain and you're choosing what you want to actively put into your subconscious mind and that's the magic right? We have the ability to actually choose that's what auto suggestions all about and so this phrase right here from Koo it's so interesting I'm familiar enough with his work and both the stuff that he wrote but also like all the other new thought leaders who are writing about his work they all bring back this stuff like as you know as Dr. Koo says you need to add auto suggestion and then they all come back to this quote so this is a quote they Koo at every one of his patients say every single day the quote is this day by day in every way I'm getting better and better and so we had people say that over and over and over again right and it's important when you do your auto suggestions that you're using phrases your subconscious mind is not going to disagree with right I'm rich I'm rich I'm rich your subconscious mind is like you're not rich right you're not saying like you know I'm at this I'm at this you've noticed like the phrasing of this day by day in every way I'm getting better and better like your subconscious mind can't say like day by day in every way all different ways I'm getting better and better right so this is like the core auto suggestion that he leads but and there's tons of more inside the books they have you start weaving into everything but this is the core one so when I found this ad again I was on eBay searching for more of his work and I found this magazine cover he was on and then I saw this ad and I saw you know the picture right here where it's got auto suggestion and the little ad holding the actual saying I was like this is insane and again this ad was to push people to go buy one of his books and so that's what auto suggestion is for everyone this is a key principle that we can and should be learning but also if I want to weave this back to like sell a lot of you know I had an event called selling online where I'm teaching people mass persuasion and what's interesting is all the things we use when we are trying to do you know a webinar or a challenge or speaking to the masses everything we're doing is still based on these same principles right if I want to persuade somebody to do something what am I doing right I'm literally putting suggestions into their subconscious mind kind of like stage hypnosis if you ever seen a stage hypnotist like the hypnotist is getting someone into a hypnotic state and then giving them suggestions right and so the more you understand about auto suggestions from the personal development world and how they work on you the more you can weave these same suggestions into your presentations or you are speaking on a webinar or a challenge or a youtube video right you're finding suggestions you're telling people they're going to help break their false beliefs to help them to actually break through and and have more success and whatever it is you're trying to teach them or trying to sell them so a couple examples like let's say I'm doing a webinar right and let's say I know that the suggestion they've been getting their whole life it's really hard to make money right or the thoughts that pop in their heads like this is hard I'm a newbie I'm just a beginner right if I know these are the thoughts going into them okay I need to create suggestions that I can put into my presentation and again a suggestion is a statement right it's not a question like I do questions that are trial closed but suggestions is a statement I'm obviously about this like a hypnotic statement like if you're hypnotizing something like you are getting sleepy so if you listen to any of my presentations you'll notice when I use suggestions I'm suggesting something right so a good example our recent funnel hacking live event right I was doing a presentation and on day three of the event I did a pitch for some people to go by right and there's like the emotional buyers who jump up and they run the back in the room by but I know there's a group of people who are very logical buyers right and so I tell them say hey for those you guys who didn't invest yet tonight you're going to go back to your hotel room and when you're in your hotel room tonight you're going to be sitting there thinking about the fact that you could have took an action but you didn't you know that it's something you want to do this you know something you want to be successful with but for some reason it just hasn't happened yet and you're going to struggle you're going to flip and you're going to toss and you're going to turn this can be really difficult to sleep at night tell you decide to make that decision that you want to move forward after you make that decision to move forward then you're going to have a great night's sleep but until then it's you're really going to struggle and how many years have I ever done that in the past boom right so I'm telling that I'm giving the hypnotic statements and that night what happens typically is that the logical thinkers go back and in bed they're sitting there like thinking about it and they're stressing out they're literally doing what you just told them you're suggesting to their subconscious mind subconscious mind is picking that up and then they actually do that I see it the next day I get people all the time because the next day when they come back then we do a repitch and do a repitch I talk my logical buyers how many guys struggle bass not you were tossing attorney everyone's hands are up yeah that was me that was me I'm like okay now we're gonna talk about logically why you need to make a logical argument and then we push people to go by and then all the logical buyers go and buy so that's one example a way that I would use it if I'm speaking from stage another one might be again someone struggling with money like first I'm doing a trial close okay the question how many guys your whole life you've heard this that you need money to make money the making money is hard and it was like yeah yeah okay and then I'll come back and say something like I want you to understand like in the past you've probably heard that making money is hard but the reality is making money is actually easy you can actually make money when you start understanding the principles and the processes and after you understand that then you'll be able to be successful it'll literally unlocks you know and I'm just suggesting to the brain the opposite of what the false belief is if you notice and you start dissecting any of my sales presentations and you put out a timeline you will notice you just trial close trial close and then we've been suggestions suggestions suggestions and coming back and so it's the same thing that coup is teaching from the personal development standpoint to rewrite your subconscious mind is the same thing you have to understand as a persuader and influencer to rewrite the false beliefs of the people you're trying to persuade all right if you guys want a copy of my notes for the coup method and also have this quote that you can literally put on your fridge and note and say it every single day day by day and every way I'm getting better and better literally every morning wake up say that put it on your phone say it over and over again if you want the notes and the quote again there's a link in the description down below go get it the notes are free for you and that way you can kind of speed read this book and get the highlights the best quotes the best ideas other than that I hope you guys enjoyed this video and we'll see you guys on the next one and if you're struggling to know how to actually use this or what suggestion you should say don't worry I got you as you're waiting to click on the next video I will give you some suggestions you're one fun away you're one fun away you're just one fun away you're one fun away you're one fun away don't say it you're one fun away
