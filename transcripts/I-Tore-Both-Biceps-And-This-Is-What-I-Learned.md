## Transcript
What's up everybody? This is Russell. Welcome back to the show. Excited to be hanging out with you guys today. And excited for a lot of reasons. I'm going to tell you guys some stories about my arm. Why am I wearing a sling? You've watched the video version. You can see I only got one arm. I'm going to talk about some Napoleon Hill stuff I found in an unpublished manuscript slash event, like a course that he taught and a whole bunch of other things. So I'm excited to hang out with you guys and talk. I wanted to start by addressing the elephant in the room, which is for those who can see me like, Russell, why do you have your arm in a sling right now? And if you listen to the last, you know, one of the last podcast episodes, I was actually, I had just gotten back. I had done a wrestling tournament and you guys knew I had hurt both my biceps. I was driving to go get an MRI and that was, I think the last podcast episode I recorded. Since then, my life has been crazy. So after getting the MRI, we found out that both of my biceps had detached from the bone inside of my arms, which is why it was really hard to curl anything up. Right. And I needed to get surgery to get both of them back. And so some people have been asking, like, what was the process? Like what, like, how did you detach the biceps? So, um, uh, some of you guys know, there, there's a, every single year there's a wrestling tournament. It's called the masters division. So it's for people who are older. Um, and I remember when I was wrestling in college, I remember going to, to one of the bigger national tournaments. And so they have different levels. Like there's like the senior level and then, you know, whatever. And then, um, there's a masters and a veterans division division. I remember going again, while I was, you know, I was in college, I remember seeing these guys are like, they're seventies and eighties with gray hair bald out there wrestling. And I was like, oh, so cool. And then, um, when I got done with my wrestling career, I kind of, you know, that was kind of the end of it. I wasn't planning on wrestling again and kind of forgot about it. And fast forward to, you know, a decade and a half later is when I bought my new home, I built a wrestling room in it. And, and, um, and I started inviting some of my old wrestling buddies over and we started wrestling. So that was kind of a fun thing. We do it once or twice a month. So my buddies come over to wrestle again. It was just so much fun to get back to like my favorite thing in the world, which is wrestling, right? And then, um, what's interesting is one of my buddies who, who, uh, wrestled with, that's his name is Lex. One day he came back. He's like, oh, I wrestled the tournament two weeks ago. I'm like, what? He's like, yeah, there's a tournament that I competed in. I was like, why did you tell me I would have gone? And so the next year we decided, okay, we're going to go to the tournaments. We put it on the calendar and, uh, you know, life is busy. I'm running a company and a family and a bunch of other stuff. And so I remember leading up to it. Um, we blocked out like seven days. We were going to, we were planning on like to working out a whole bunch leading up to it, but then just didn't happen. So then the week before the tournament, we blocked out, okay, every morning we're going to wrestle for an hour and just get prepared for this tournament. And again, I hadn't wrestled competitively in almost 20 years, right? And so we go to the very first practice, the very first day. And within the very first, like 10 minutes, I injure my neck so bad that like, I can't move. I can't turn my head. I can't do anything. And it, it hurt really bad. And people were like, well, are you still going to wrestle? I'm like, yeah, like I made a commitment myself. I was going to wrestle. I'm going to do a C. And, um, I had Kyros coming over and other people and people just to me and massage therapists. And like, I was doing all the crazy things, try to heal this, heal the, heal my neck and we're going to the tournament. My neck hurts so bad. Uh, and I wrestled two days and I did, I did well. I placed, I can't refuel, I placed some freestyle or Greco, but anyway, wrestle two different tournaments, had some success, won a medal. And I remember one of the, it was like, one of these like life changing things for me as I was, um, warming up with some of the guys my age, this older guy came up to me and again, he's from London. His name is Tony and he's wearing his single. He's got knee pads on his stuff. He's just older guy. He came up and he's like, Hey, do you want to wrestle? And I was like, like, you want to warm up? I'm like, um, I guess we can. And so he's like, cool. It's like when we're drilling though, he's like, I've, I've, uh, had the hip and knee replacements. So don't shoot on me. I'm like, what? Like I'm just supposed to wrestle. You don't have hips or knees. And, uh, anyway, so we kind of warmed up a little bit. It was kind of fun. And then, uh, during the tournament, I saw him, he actually went and won some matches. I was like, if this dude, you know, he's in the seventies, hips and knees replaced can still be wrestling. I'm like, I'm going to do this every year until I die. So that was, that became the commitment to myself. And then every year after that, I go back and do this tournament. I do this tournament. It's just really fun. And so this year's, I don't know, my fifth or sixth year, and this one's actually. There's three styles of wrestling. I'm the freestyle Greco and there's a collegiate style. The only wrestling America and there's a collegiate national tournament. I've never been to before. So this is the one I was going to. I've wanted to go to forever. I was finally going to go to it. And so leading up to I'm preparing, I'm getting ready. And then I told the story for, so I go fast. I injured my forearm and I almost pulled me out of it. And then last minute, I'm like, you know what? I'm just going to do it. So I taped up my forearm, went to the tournament, had it cut 25 pounds. I was losing weight and during warmups, I tore my other four arms. What my forms are hurt. But I was like, anyway, but it wasn't bad enough. I couldn't wrestle. So I go out there to wrestle day number one, rest of my first two matches. I can't remember what happened exactly. And I do know that by the time it was done, I got off the mat and I could not flex my bicep. And I was like, oh, like maybe I just hit a nerve or something, but that definitely does not feel good at all. And then they called my name for one more match. I thought I was done, but there's one more match. They call me out there. And so I go out there with like my left arm. There's no biceps, right? And so I go wrestle. I shoot with my right hand. I get a really good sweep single on him. He sprawls and I hear my right bicep go pop. And anyway, luckily I still finished the match. I win. I get off the ref tries to raise my, raise my head. I can barely lift my hand and I'm a wreck. So from there, I'm like looking down both my arms. I'm like, they just didn't look like normal. I had something look different. I was like, ah, this is not good. But anyway, from there, we had a spring break. So I flew from there to meet my family. Why we joined Hawaii came back. And then that was last week where I was driving the MRI to get my thing, my thing X-rayed, right? Anyway, so X-rayed it, find out both my biceps have been torn off of the bone. And so they wanted to do both of them ASAP. So like you need to get these done quickly. The problem is, you know, if you do both and I have no arms and then give it no arms, how are you supposed to do anything? You can't feed yourself. You can't put on your clothes. How do you go to the bathroom? Like there's so many questions. And so the surgeon was like, let's do one first. And that way you have one hand you can work with. And then two weeks later, we'll do the other one. So last Friday, I did the first one. And so I've been gimpy with one arm for the last three or four days. And it's interesting because you don't realize how many times you use your hand until you can't use your hand. Like, even though it's my right hand, I got my right hand available. Like you can't tie a shoe. You can't put on a sock. You can't. There's so many things you can't do. And so luckily, my amazing wife Collette's been helping me to survive, but it's been it's been weird. And then, you know, a week from Friday, I have to get the other one. And I literally have two arms that are not functioning. And then what's crazy is that Friday, I'll have my second arm. And then Monday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, we have my inner circle meetings. I'll be on stage with two, two casts on running my inner circle. So it's going to be an interesting week, but it'll be amazing. So the question, sorry, I told you that story number one, because it's it's fun to tell the story and like I said, I've asked about it. But number two is because the question I keep getting from everybody, including my wife, especially my wife, I love her. But it's just like, aren't you too old to do this? Shouldn't you not be doing this? And like that's the the comment that people keep coming up. And I think the most people are so scared of getting hurt. They don't want to do things, right? Like that's just kind of a this commonality that most people have. Like you're too old, you shouldn't be doing it. You're going to get hurt. Like you shouldn't be doing that because what if something happens in the what if, what if there's always these what ifs, right? And most people live their lives based off of what ifs. Like what if this happens, what if this happens? And they're thinking about all the things that could possibly happen. So because of that, they don't pursue and do the thing that they really want to do. And as you can probably tell, I've never lived my life that way. I've always lived my life in a way of like, what if I do this thing? Like, what would that be like? What would it feel like? What would, you know, no, no, I would step back and say, if I was still competing as an athlete, I probably would treat this different. I knew I was hurt. I probably wouldn't have continued to compete. But for me, it's like I compete one day a year. So it's like, I'm going to do this thing. And I got like 365 days to heal. It's kind of like happy Gilmore when, when after he, he does make hockey trials, he's there the next day and the, he's in the batting cage and they're shooting balls and he's hitting him in the face. He's like, 364 days till next year's hockey season. I got to do it. And he's just like getting well bound by balls. That's why I feel like I'm like, I got 365 days to heal. I'll be fine. You know, after the first year I tore my neck, I had the whole year by next year. I didn't remember my neck. It was fine. I was able to go out there and compete and I hurt something different. And every year hurts something. Uh, but for me, it's just, it's more like, like there's what a fear and what a faith. Right. Some people are like, there's what if insert the fear? And so they don't do the thing because what if this happened? What if I get made fun of? What if I get hurt? What if it doesn't work? What if I fail? What if I go bankrupt? What if I, you know, what if people make fun of me? Like there's that, what if that keeps most people from doing anything amazing? Like, and the other what if is like, well, what if I do do this? Well, man, what if I am a 45 year old guy and I'm competing in a tournament? What if I'm doing the, what if I inspire somebody else? What if I have fun? What if I win? What if I, you know, like the, the other what ifs is the more important one. And as I was like writing this, you know, the outline of this episode, I was like, I'm just kind of thinking through this. And there's this quote that popped in my head. And I, the first time I heard this quote was actually for my friends. He passed away. Some of you guys know Dave Hollis. He passed away a couple of years ago, but he had this tattooed on his arm. And it was just one of those really, really cool quotes that I'm not a tattoo guy, but if I was, maybe this would be one I would get. This is what he said. This is what the quote says. And the quote is attributed to a guy named John A. Shed. And apparently it, check this out. I just told me it came from his book Salt for My Attic. Anyway, this is what the quote says. It says, a ship in a harbor is safe, but that's not what ships are built for. Ooh, let me say it again. A ship in the harbor is safe, but that's not what ships are built for. Right. Yeah. Staying home and not competing. I'd be much more safe. Not going to get injured, not going to tear my neck, not going to tear a bicep, or another bicep, not going to have to deal with all these things. But that's not what it was built for. Right. I was not built to sit at home behind a desk and just, you know, like I was built for something more. And I believe all of you guys are as well. And obviously don't go do something stupid like I did, like be intelligent with your thing, but also don't let the what ifs hold you back. Let the what ifs be a thing that pushes you forward and gets you to want to go do and explore and create and be the person. So many of you guys, um, you have, um, I guess I shared this, this quote from David Thoreau at Funhackin Live about like most men die with their songs still in them. Right. Like most people, they, they, they live life, but they never actually live life. Right. They have this dream, this thing they want, but what ifs keep them from ever doing it? Right. And I don't want to be that person who ever dies with the, with the song still in me. I want to be the person who's like, man, that guy was a little crazy. Look what he did. Look what he accomplished. What he keeps doing. Look, he keeps showing up, keeps doing these things. And like, I want that to be my legacy. Not, oh yeah. He was the guy that, um, you know, who worked that I into five and that was all he did. You know, like I want to be the guy who was, who was, who was doing stuff with my life. Um, I don't know about you, but it makes me feel young. Yes. I feel old right now with my gimped out arms. I can barely even do anything, but it makes me feel alive just knowing that like I'm still out there doing things and trying things that, that don't always make sense. So anyway, I want to start there. The ship in the harbor is safe, but that's not what ships are billed for. And that's not what you're billed for. So what is the things you're going to want to do that are a little uncomfortable? Um, they're not going to kill you. Don't do, don't go too crazy. I'm not going to die from wrestling. My, my terrible, my biceps off. Um, but yeah, pick something that's that, um, we're just stretching yourself. And I promise you feel better. So I'm leading with that. Number two, um, uh, again, this podcast, there's a couple of different things I'm hitting, so this is not just like one theme for the entire episode. So I apologize in advance for those who are my people. Like I want one, the one big takeaway. Uh, we got a couple here. So next off is, um, uh, I don't know if you guys, how many of you saw Jordan Peterson launched Peterson Academy? It's just new, like college curriculum, college course membership site that's like, he's like 500 bucks a year or something like that. Anyway, when it came out, I signed up immediately. I want to see it. What's crazy is he's so good at, at, um, at free traffic. Like he, I think it's a, but like 30 or 50,000, 30 to 50,000 people in without paid ads, which is insane, right? Insane. Uh, so obviously I signed up. I want to see the models that they're doing. And it got me really inspired and excited. Like he has all these people coming in, teaching courses and lectures and things like that. And it's just like, uh, such a fun way to consume and to learn. And so for me, I was like, I want to do more stuff like that. Like how do I, like I want to do more lectures where I'm teaching and, and I want to bring fascinating people in to have these conversations with me. And so the secrets of success business, we're creating an app right now. And I'm trying to create these courses that will go inside the app. Um, and so we did last week was actually the day before I got my arm chopped open. So I was, I was in there. If you ever watched the videos, see how I'm all gimped out. Like my arms don't really work. But, um, before I got the surgery, I had Napoleon Hill's grandson. Um, and then, uh, again, a Jason Youngblood who wrote a book about, he's called the gospel and Napoleon Hill. And it's the huge timeline. These guys know the point of his life better than anyone. So I flew them in. We did this whole like probably four or five hour long, um, like train, of course, talking about Napoleon Hill's life going from like the beginning. And then each of the, the successes and the wins, the failures, the ups, the downs, the negatives, the positives. We like weaved in like what the anti-Napoleon Hill people say and like refuted them and prove that things right. And like, um, it was, it was really fun. It was one of my favorite things. That's such a good time. And this Friday I'm doing something similar. Uh, we have another book. Uh, it's called truthful advertising. Napoleon Hill in 1917, uh, he started a college called the George Washington. Um, uh, sorry, flipping page with one hand. So I feel like a gimp's cause I am, uh, the George Washington Institute. And he was teaching this advertising course called truthful advertising. Uh, and he, he was, he had a reference book. It's called productive advertising by George Hess. Uh, and I've had a bunch of first editions of that as well. But anyway, so basically what I'm doing is we're taking this, this book. And so we have the manuscripts from this book, uh, then Paul, he'll taught. And he gets never been published before. It was not a, it was not, um, it was a, it was a college, like year long course. He taught, right? So it's the, it's all of the material from that course that he taught along with this book that uses the workbook. And so we put it together and we're going to be, um, in secrets of success, launching a new level. It's all about advertising and marketing and stuff like that. So we're going to be opening up this new, this, this second tier. And in there, we're going to do a whole course on this book, truthful advertising. And so the fun is I've had a chance to go through and read this and I've been reading this whole book the last two or three days and getting inside of Paulie Hill's head is so fun. Cause the pulling hills, you guys know, he's obviously like a personal development guy. He loves personal development stuff like that, but he's teaching advertising. And what's cool about Napoleon and most of them actually, honestly, most of the, the best personal development guys like Robert Collier is another great example. Robert Collier, um, and some of the best personal development courses and books ever, ever of all time, uh, but he was an advertiser. So he, he wrote the Robert Collier letter book, which is his marketing book, but he wrote sales letters to sell his personal development courses. And he ended up selling, uh, I believe it was between a hundred and 200 million dollars worth of courses through direct mail in the early 19, uh, 1920s, right, which is crazy. And so, um, but he was an advertiser first. So he uses advertising to, to proliferate and get his message out to the world, right, which is a hint for you guys. And you guys who have a message, you had to become a great advertiser first, and then you can get your message out. But Paulie Hill was the same way, right? Um, when he was 40ish, he wrote thinking, grow rich, but when he was in his 20s, he was teaching advertising course. So he understood advertising first and then you use that and leverage that. Um, so there's a hint for all of you guys, any of you guys who have a message you want to learn, it's like you need to become a great advertisers. If you're going to be successful. So there's that, there's the one little caveat or one little thing to share. So anyways, I'm going through his book. It's really fascinating because he uses, uh, the productive advertising book as like the, the actual training teaching, like the specifics about advertising. Uh, but then in his book, he like, there's a, there's a lesson ahead of time where he's teaching stuff related to the book chapters. I would find the exact word, but with one hand, it's so hard to flip pages. So, uh, you get the gist. You guys should be good from there in this lesson number two of truthful advertising. He's talking about, again, what's interesting is Napoleon Hill's. Again, he's an advertiser, but he loves a personal development. So most of the stuff he's writing about his personal development and his premises, that, that you as the advertiser has to become a better person. Like you have to become, you have to develop yourself as an advertiser. And then that's how you become a great advertiser. Right. So he's spending less time on like, um, here's a structure, the ads and things like that, which the other book does. But in his, all his writing is very much like, here's how you become a better person. Like, how do you pick a definite purpose? How do you focus? How do you learn? Like, how do you, um, how do you learn how to think? How do you learn? Like, like, it's just so fascinating. I love his, the, the rabbit holes. He goes down on that side of things. Right. And anyway, in here, as he's talking about being an advertiser, he starts going through like his dream client. Like if you can become this person, he's like, you can get hired by any firm anywhere in the world, because everybody would want to hire you if these were your qualities and your characteristics. And so I read those last night. I highlight the whole thing in my book. Again, I have, I have a little, uh, red highlighter in one hand. So like, I'm trying to like do these straight lines. It's, it's chaos, but, um, regardless, it's really good. So I'm going to read you this stuff. Cause this might help you to figure out if you're struggling life, like getting hired, getting people to give you money as a coach or consultant, like, like these qualities he talks about here. And again, he's using this, like these are qualities that he wants in an advertiser. So who's going to become an advertiser and work for him or for, you know, one of these firms, but the way he explained it, I was like, man, if I could step into these qualities, all of them, like how much better a person I'd be, how much more likely would people want to hire me as their coach or hire me as their trainer or whatever those things might be. Right. So I'm going to read these for, for you that there's, um, there's like 15 of, yeah, it's 15 of them. All right. So here's the specifications. Um, uh, he says, he says, as a right, there's an opening in my organization. They'll pay the person qualified to fill it, um, all the way from 5,000 to $10,000 a year. So that's the equivalent of like half a million dollars a year salary. Right. So he's saying like, if you have these qualifications, we can pay you half a million dollars a year in, in salary. Right. So here's the specifications. Number one, I want a man or woman who will finish everything he or she starts, whether it's sharpening a pencil, writing a letter or something of greater importance. Okay. So number one is like somebody who can be a finisher. Not just a starter. A lot of people get starters. Okay. And I'm a good starter. Um, I'm not as good of a finisher, but other parts in the book he talked about. He's like, uh, he quoted somebody said that every time they picked up a paper on their desk, they always, they always solved it before they put it down. Right. They weren't just like, Oh, I'll look at this later, later, later. It's like then focusing on people who actually get things done and finishing. Now, if you struggle at finishing number one, that's something you can focus on. Like, how do you get things to the finish line? Right. No one gets paid till the thing gets to the finish line. Right. So you have to be good at that. But the other thing, this is kind of just a tweak on this. I learned this from Alex Mendoza, one of my first mentors in this game. I remember he told me one time, he said, Russell, there's two types of people in this world. There's people who are starters and there's people who are finishers. He's a good figure out who you are and then surround yourself with the other type of person. Um, and for me, I realized like I'm a really good starter, um, but I struggled at finishing. And so for me, I started surrounding myself with finishers. And so you look at click funnels of the company, right? It's like there's three or four starters. There's me, there's Todd, there's a couple of guys like the starters on team and everybody else are our finishers. Help us finish the things. Um, so that's number one. So again, I want to man or woman who will finish everything he or she starts, whether it's sharpening a pencil, writing a letter or something of greater importance, okay? Cause the way we do some things is the way we do all things. Uh, number two, I want someone who will do at least everything he is told to do and will not offer excuses or take the place, uh, or not offer excuses to take the place of results. Okay. So somebody who was like, when you give them a task, they're like, yes, sir, I will go do it. I'll do the thing versus like, I don't really want to, you know, it's like, someone's like, yes, you gave me a task and then go do it. And number two part of this is they will not offer excuses, um, only results. So this comes back to like one of our core values in our company, which is extreme ownership, right? Like, like if it doesn't work, there's no. Excuses. It's just like, I give you results or I don't, if I don't give results, it's my fault. I'm going to go figure out how to do it and keep doing it until I get the result, right? And so I love that someone's going to do at least everything he's told to do. I love that it's not like he's going to do everything he's told to at least. So the minimum is what he's told to do. Right. Um, and then not offering excuses to take the place of results, just results. Okay. So I love that. That's number two. All right. Third, third thing here, I want someone who will reach out and demand greater responsibilities, taking care of all the while to keep growing and getting ready to assume additional duties. Okay. So he wants somebody who's not going to sit there because I have team members who are great at what they do, but, um, they'll do the things that you gave him to do. And then it was kind of wait until you get more stuff and they'll kind of hang out and it's like, I hate that versus I want someone who will reach out and demand greater responsibilities. Okay. I want more. Give me more. What else can I do? What else can I do? I remember Dave Woodward, um, yeah, I love Dave. One of my favorite qualities of him is he was at the peak. He was the CEO click when I was running it and he get done the day and meet him and be last during the office almost every single time. And he come in afterwards like, Hey, what can I take off your plate? What can I take off your plate? He's always tried to figure out how to lighten my load, how to take things off my plate. And that's what it is. Right. Someone who will reach out and demand greater responsibility. Right. And then getting ready to assume additional duties. Um, or they want to keep growing and getting ready to assume additional duties. Right. So going out there and, um, demanding great responsibilities. Okay. Another great quality. All right. Three and these are good. Right. I was reading this like, this is good stuff. This could be just like my own review of myself. Like Russell, get better of these things and you'll become a better person. So all right. Number four, I want someone who will love the job so well, they will forget hours, forget pay for, get Saturday nights, forget all his own selfish interests and devote his entire time and thought to the task of carving out a future and the opportunity to hand. Ooh, something to love the job so well, they forget everything. Okay. I don't know about you guys, but that's my world. Like I love what I do so much that like, if it wasn't for the fact that I had a wife and kids at home, I would never leave this place. In fact, when they go on vacation sometimes I've literally set up, uh, caught in here and slept in here. Cause I'm like, I don't have to go home at night. This is amazing. Right. Cause I love what I do so much. And so you want to find people and you want to be the person and when you are. Um, doing this thing that you become so obsessed that you like are all consumed. It becomes your thing. I number five, I want someone who'll be frank and sincere with himself and, uh, and all with whom he comes in contact with and who will be a living example of our slogan, which is truthful advertising. So we want people to be frank and sincere. Um, yeah. So there you go. Frank and sincere. Um, and living example of truthful advertising, uh, truthful advertising is the name of the course and the concept here is like, you want to give advertising this truthful, like there's a lot of ways you can write ads that trick people. The Bible, he's like, how do you do that in a way where you're always giving 100% the truth? So that was good. Number six, I want to be a person who will not wait for me or some of the other officials to tell me what to do, but who will learn to see what ought to be done and do it. Ooh, this is like the, the, um, the self-starter, right? They see problems and they go and take care of them. They're not waiting for someone to tell them what to do. They're like, okay, this is problem. This problem is fixed. This has changed and just get the stuff done. Number seven, I want a person who's big enough to overlook the little insults, which thoughtless people can throw out often unintentionally, a person who can see something good in every human being on earth, a person who will honestly strive to develop the good there is in every person with whom he comes in contact. Okay. I think this was almost the twofold, right? Number one or number two was like, uh, seeing the good in other people. But number one was, uh, being big enough to overlook, uh, to overlook little insults. Uh, there's a quote from Brigham Young that I thought was really cool. He says, um, uh, only a fool. What'd he say? Only a fool. Uh, how does the quote go? It's like only a fool takes in, um, uh, gets insulted when, when, uh, when somebody like intense insults you and only a greater fool takes offense when they didn't intend to, uh, which I thought was really cool. So something like that. I'm sure you messed up the quote, but basically, yeah, if someone's trying to offend you and take you, you take offense and you're a fool, but if someone offends you and they weren't trying to offend you, you're even a bigger fool. That's basically the gist of the quote. And so I thought it was kind of cool. It was like being big enough to overlook little insults, like just wash them off your back, like a duck out of water, keep moving forward and try to see the good in every single person. Uh, one of the lessons I learned from Tony Robbins back in the day, I think was the most powerful, I learned so many things from Tony that were like life changed, but one of them was just, um, um, his belief that, uh, everybody does things out of what they believe are, are like good, good intense, right? Even if they're evil, bad things, like most people, I think Tony said all people do things, um, out of good intentions, even if that thing is wrong. And like he gave an example at UPW where, um, if you've been to UPW Tony does interventions with people and there's workbooks. And anyway, someone saw their partner's workbook and the workbook, they're talking about like killing their wife and the kids, right? Which is a horrible thing, like purely evil, right? Obviously. And so the person saw that told one of Tony's runners, like, Hey, Mike, my guy I'm working with, he's talking about killing his wife and kids. They went told Tony and Tony does this intervention with the person, brings him up on stage and try to figure out like, why are you doing this? And what's crazy is like, again, you, you see that, that lens from the outside. It's like that person's got bad intentions. They're trying to kill their wife and the kids, right? Bad intentions. But then we told him to the intervention of the person. He talked about when he was a kid, that his dad had left them as a family. Because the dad left him, they lost their house, they lost their home. They left, moved from different school, lost everything. They were, um, I mean, their whole life had been shattered. And in their mind, they believe that because their dad left, their life was destroyed, right? And so this person now was in a spot where he did not feel happy. He wanted to leave. He wanted to, to exit this life, but he knew that he exited this life. It would destroy his wife and his kids. And so out of mercy, he wanted to also end their life. So they wouldn't go through the pain that he went through. You look at that, it's like, whoa, like little paradigm shift, right? Um, good intentions, evil outcome. Yes, but, but, but people in most cases have a good intention. And so I think I try, I'm not perfect at this by, by any stretch, but I tried more and more in my life. When people offend me or upset me to think about like, like, what are their actual intentions? What are they trying to do? And usually it's, I believe it's usually, uh, positive intentions just directed incorrectly. So I'm going to put that out there. Cause that was kind of cool. What number did I leave off on? If I had two hands, I would have, I had one hand on the notes, but I got one gimpy hand and one real hand. So I'm not sure exactly. Let me see where I, um, let's see. Okay. Yeah. That was number seven. Okay. Number eight. I want, uh, I want a person who will believe heart and soul and everything he does in connection with his position, a person who will not misrepresent institute, either by direct statements or by innuendo. Okay. So someone who's true and faithful in all things. Very cool. Number nine, I want a person who will meet the public with a smile on his face, a smile that comes from, from the heart. I want him to shake hands with people as though he enjoyed it. Okay. Positive face, positive attitudes, big smile, shaking hands, uh, always having that positivity. Number 10, I want a person who will not be jealous of fellow employees or afraid that one of them will get his job. A person who will help those around him be more efficient. A person who will be, uh, happy and enthusiastic. This one's cool because I see this a lot of times where, uh, internal office dynamics, I'll see where somebody doesn't want to help someone else because it might make them look bad. It might make them like, well, if they're doing that, then do you even need me anymore versus like everyone working towards the same goal. Like, you know, and like, anyway, so I thought that was, uh, a really good one as well. Number 11, I want a person who truly loves to serve his fellow man and who will look upon this, his opportunity to do so as a welcome privilege. Okay. Something who wants to over deliver at all times. Number 12, I want a person who's observant, who sees all that goes on around him, who can distinguish between the important and the unimportant experiences of his daily routines, retainers, and classifying the former and brushing aside later. Okay. So this is somebody who, um, uh, who can notice all things, but then has the discernment to be like, this is the most important. So I need to first and the second, these things aren't important, like having the, the ability to discern those things. Uh, this is one that takes a lot of time to train people. A lot of people see all tasks as level A one, most important thing versus like, Hey, here's a lot of stuff we got to do. What are the things that we have to get done? Let's put those in first. I want the things that would be nice to get done. And what are things like that'd be cool, but not that important, right? And being able to like differentiate between those things. So you make sure you're getting the things done to the most vital, most important. Number 13, I want a person who knows, or we'll take the time to learn how to eat properly. A person will not, uh, in cap in, cap, I'm going to say the word wrong in cap. Yeah. You know the word who's not going to incapitate themselves. That's not the right word, but here we go and become a grouch by over eating at 75% of the people of today are doing. So once someone's going to be healthy, okay? I agree with this because, um, I see, uh, I'm a big believer in energy and like tracking energy and like what you eat throughout the day, depends your energy levels. Um, I used to have a big breakfast in the morning. I would crash and I'd no energy for us today that I shifted where I would skip breakfast and I'd eat lunch and I had great energy and nap lunch. I would crash in the rest of the day. And I started shifting where nothing but fats and proteins for breakfast and for lunch and no carbs till dinner and my energy extended throughout the entire day. And so, um, the people I see all the time who like, I see my staff who ordered the most crazy foods and are eating at like noon. I'm like, you're shot for the rest of your mind. Literally is going to get dim and hard to focus and hard to think through because of that, like, and so I love this one of just like take care of yourself because it'll increase your energy, your mental abilities, all kinds of things when you're, um, when you're sharp. Number 14, I want to be a person who refused to allow himself to be aroused by anger by some ill-bred person who hasn't learned the art of self-control. Ooh, don't, don't get angry around people who are morons because there's a lot of them in this world and they're going to be everywhere, especially when you're online, especially you're posting social media. Um, all right. And the last one here, number 15, I want to, I want a person who believes that he ought to be paid an exact ratio to what he produces for the business, whether it is a thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars a year and he'll be satisfied with that. Uh, this is a big one. One of my pet peeves on this planet is when people come and they ask for a raise because they've been working at your company for a certain period of time. Derives me crazy. I would never in infinity years ask for a raise when I'm doing the exact same thing that I had agreed to get paid for originally. Right. For me, I would come in and say, okay, this will be great. I'm going to work really hard and get this thing. And then it's like, okay, I figured out a way I can add extra million dollars a year to the company. Like let me do that. And then come back to, Hey, I added a million dollars a year with company external from what we had already agreed upon. Like, like, and then I want to raise here. Or I want, you know, I want a royalty or something like, you know, it's, it's tough. Like when people, one of the hardest things internally is that we always want to share wins and things that happen inside the company, be sure to win. And all of a sudden you literally next week's when people are asking for raises. It's like, it doesn't work that way. Like, you know, like, um, anyway, it comes back to what he said here. I want a person who believes that he ought to be paid in the exact ratio for what he produces for the business, whether it's a thousand or a hundred thousand dollars a year and we'll be satisfied with that. So what are you actually producing for the business and money? Right. And a business owner, if you're an employee in a business should be making, you know, if you're going to pay a hundred grand a year, they should be making three or four million dollars off of your efforts. If they're not, like there's, and again, there's some number that I can't remember that some of the business people will throw out as like, this is the number of the ratio, but that's the reality. Cause you think about that. Like I think about my company, let's say we make $10 million a year, right? Half of that goes to government. Um, half that goes to the employees. Half of that goes to the other, you know, like on a $10 million thing, like I might take home $500,000. So it's like when someone's like, we made $10 million for the company. It's like, cool. Um, $500. That's actually, that's actually generous when you have a big company. Yeah. Cause $10 million dollars, if you're at 20% profit margin, uh, you're at two million. And then you got partners. Anyway, so when all of a sudden, I don't know, there's a rabble hole is going down, I'm not sure exactly why, other than, um, just understanding that like, if you're an employee of a company, like, like, again, you're going to pay a hundred grand a year, you should be producing three, three, three and a half million dollars a year to sell in value, you know, in money for the company. And if you want to raise, like it's increasing that. So how do I go from three million to five billion a year? Like, like if I can figure out how to fix that, that's how I can make more. That's why to traditionally someone who's working gets capped at a certain point. Cause it's hard to go from, if you're making the company $3 million a year to $6 million, it's hard, right? That to double it's really hard. But if you're a manager and now you're managing three people who are just like you and now you're making, you know, three, three X as much. Now you're more valuable because you were able to leverage and get in and make more money. Right. So now it's like, does that make sense? Like that's typically like the levels of value, how you go up in things. Right. My iron golden's got his four levels of value, which I'm not going to go deep on that, but, but as you move from like working with your hands, this is the lowest level of value because again, you're capped by, by hours and you go manager, which is the next level of value. Cause again, you have leverage now where you're managing multiple people to get more production. So they work more. The third level of value. Then is, um, is communication where you can communicate ideas. You can sell things. You can sell one to many, right? Without others, there's, uh, you can produce more money and less period time and number four, a level is imagination where you're inventing businesses and ideas. Right. And so like you make more money, not by, not by getting better necessarily at any of the, the levels of value. It's by moving up a level of values where you start making more, more money because there's more leverage and there's more, um, you're making more money for the, for the company or the business. Right. So anyway, I'm sharing those, uh, for you guys, cause I thought those 15 were really cool. And again, I'm looking through this lens of like, if I was an employee, this is like, this should be my Bible for myself, like what I'm going to do and accomplish to be worth what I want to be worth. Right. If I'm an entrepreneur, I've looked at this for like my team, but also for myself, like these are the elements that I want in myself to be the right person. Um, and, uh, yeah, I thought, I thought it was really good. So at the very end of the section, Napoleon Hill says those are the specifications. If you can fill them, you can have that position, or if you should be filled or that position should be filled when you apply. Don't worry because I have a dozen or more friends among the Chicago businessmen who would consider that I have done them an everlasting favor by sending you to them. So that's the key is like, if you, if you are that person, any company would hire you, right? If you are that person, your company will grow because you have the values and things you have, um, are insane. So anyway, one of the fun things I read, uh, as I was preparing for our truthful advertising, uh, course that we are filming this week, um, that'll eventually be inside of secrets of success, the advertising level. So I thought it'd be fun to share with you guys and I hope you enjoyed that and hope you enjoy this podcast. I want to start, I want to end where I started. Okay. Talking about you again, this is development of you as a person, as an advertiser, as a marketer, as a, as an entrepreneur, whatever you want to call it. Um, remember this, a ship in the harbor is safe. That's not what ships will build. It's not what ships are built for. Okay. Quit, try to be safe. It's life's not about being safe. You're not going to die and get to heaven and be like, oh, congratulations. You didn't get, you didn't get hurt. You didn't make any mistakes. You were safe the entire time. Right. It's going to come back and be like, what did you do? Right. I gave you a talent. Did you turn it into two? Did you not? Are you buried the town? Oh, so you're, you're a ship that's safe in the harbor. Right. No, no, no. Like take that talent and multiply it. Right. That's what you were built for. We're not built to sit in the harbor just waiting. You were built to go out there and do something amazing. Okay. And it's going to be stretch. It's going to be hard along the way. You're going to rip your biceps off of your bones and you're going to keep on going because it doesn't matter. Right. Me having her biceps has nothing to do with me serving my audience. Has nothing to do with me and we can have enough standing on stage and inner circle and teaching this group of entrepreneurs who've flown in. Like I can do that with no arms. Right. As long as I break my brain, I'm still good to go and serve these people. Yeah. You know, it's, so it's just thinking, thinking about that. Okay. Ship and harbor are safe, but it's not what ships are built for. You being safe is what a lot of you guys are doing, but it's not what you're built for. You were built for more. Um, I know that your eternal destiny is huge. What you are capable of, the people's lives you can change. If you will just step up to the plate and play, uh, it will be something you doesn't even make sense to you right now. I promise you, if you were told 22 year old Russell, when I first started this game, like, Hey, in the future, you're going to have an audience with a whole bunch of people and they're going to read your books and they're going to listen to your podcast and they're going to launch businesses. You're going to have 3000 people who have made over a million dollars because of your software and your training. You're going to have, you know, like, I wouldn't have believed any of that. Right. But what did I do? I didn't sit in the harbor. I was called. I went out there and I started just smashing things and just trying to do whatever I could, making tons of mistakes along the way. Um, I have, I have failed at more businesses than most of you will ever attempt. Um, and that is the truth. That is the reality. I've launched more funnels than, uh, I've lost like tens of millions of dollars on stupid ideas. I'm still here swinging because I'm not sitting in the harbor being safe. I'm out there. And so I want to give you guys some encouragement, like go out there, do the thing, be the person, you know, write the book, launch the course, do the Facebook live, do the part, I do all the stuff, even if it's not working, just do it, um, because that's how you learn, get out there and start playing the game. I appreciate you guys. Hope you enjoy this episode. If you did, please let people know about it. Uh, it's the only way we market the podcast of the YouTube is just by people, uh, sharing with other people, so let people know. And by hopefully in the near future, see another episode where I've got both my arms all jacked up. That was right now. I still got one good arm, but that's going to end soon. I'm sure. So thanks you guys appreciate you all and we'll see you on the next episode.
