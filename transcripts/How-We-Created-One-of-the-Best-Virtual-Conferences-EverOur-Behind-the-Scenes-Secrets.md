The main Russell! I paid to sell your product. I love this guy! I honestly believe the Archbruers are the only people that can actually change this planet. Alright, says we're live! It is day two. Can you believe it? Look who just showed up! Look at that guy! That's Russell Brunson! Hey! I think you're on T-screen. I don't know. I just turned my camera that way. This is day two. You guys go enjoy the day. Crush it! Good morning everybody! Or good afternoon or good evening depending on where in the world you are. I had so much fun going to the Facebook group and reading all of your big takeaways. In fact, I was going through and everyone I was reading, I was liking them. And after about an hour of it, Facebook popped up and thought I was the bot and said you can no longer, or your ban from liking for like 24 hours or something. One of our biggest fears was obviously we never done a virtual event. So this wasn't just like, hey we're going to have a camera and we're going to stream to Zoom. We wanted to make something as close to a virtual, like a live event as possible. Nobody wants to go attend a three day webinar or a two day webinar because webinars, honestly, like after the first hour and a half, they're boring. The best part about live events is you get a chance. If you learn something, go out to lunch and talk to people and get to know people and you build relationships, right? How do we replicate that? I don't know how to do it. To set this up, we had a room with like 18 different computers, had 18 different Zoom accounts. We had Jamie Smith on our team. He literally created an app and it automatically assigns everybody in their members area. So only 350 people are seeing this link, the next 350 people are seeing that link. Are we ready for this? I would rather we do this live in person, yes. Pray the Zoom doesn't have a Zoom out today. We're actually going through and doing these little breakout rooms throughout. And so for most of you guys, this will be your first time ever doing a breakout room like that. It's my first time, it's our first time doing it. What's going to happen is I'm going to have a workshop where I got something for you all to do. We're going to spend five minutes together doing that and then at the end of it, we're going to push a button and everyone's going to go into these breakout rooms and there will be smaller rooms of five to 10 people each of them. Russell wanted to have it chunked down into, like I said, those 350 size groups of individuals and then also have the ability to send them into breakout rooms. We'll have it right here ready to go and then when Russell's like, okay guys, we're going to go to breakout rooms, we got to run down this line. Zoom, however, has limitations so if you have 300 people in a room, you can do 50 breakout rooms. If you have 400 people in a room, you can only do 30 breakout rooms. And so that went on and Russell's like, well, I want groups of five to six in each breakout room. Well, if you do the math, 5,000 people divided by five is literally 1,000 breakout rooms. When you say, if you want to go back and say, all right, you're going to breakouts, then we'll all push the buttons and then you come in and say, hey, I want to start bringing people back and we'll start bringing people back. 300 plus breakout rooms. It'll work. Um, if it doesn't work, I'm just getting my truck. We're rolling. So we are currently adding everybody into their breakout rooms. Some of them we have to do manually. So if they're disappearing, is that a good thing? Yeah. Right now, as long as they come back, it's the magician type of thing. It's been interesting, about 50% of people have often not to go into break rooms. They just, you know, maybe they're a little more introverted and they're a little more nervous. So I should go and network. But the people who have have loved it. Like they're blowing up our Facebook page. I was really surprised that there were so many people brand new and they were from all over the world. You had an opportunity to kind of explain what you just work through and maybe give feedback to each other. So we were able to use the functionality of the technology to help send everybody to breakout rooms. Were they able to virtually network and gets no other folks and see faces and then with a push of a button, bring everybody back into our main room, you know, at a live event, we can never do that. Cindy, I tell you the strategy. So you say, Oh, this is why I need a story. This is the Piffney Bridge story. I get it. Now you're going to say, okay, step number one is the step to break through the package. Let me ask you this. When Russell first did he come to you or like, how did it work out to bring come to you and say, Hey, this is what we're doing like, shh, sorry. Okay. This is it. This happens. Events. Day number two now was very similar. I had a lot of presentations, but one thing we did on day number two, which was exciting was we showed the two comic book documentary. And the reason why is because typically at Final Hacking Live, there's the education side of the business, but it's also like, what's the vision, like where are we trying to get to where we're trying to go? We have this experience where people come on stage and we're in a two comic book award. And it's in a fun hockey live it when we give everyone the two comic book awards that it serves. It's like, there it is. Like that's the goal. That's the thing I'm going after. Right. And I was like, how do we replicate that here? I don't even know how to do that. We're not going to fly everybody in to give them their awards. I told them ahead of time, I said, imagine these people you're learning about. You're seeing their stories on the video. And I just want you to sit back. And really during this time is for you to sit back and like imagine yourself like, these are people who are just like me. They're just a year ahead of me. Like what can I do? What can I commit to? What do I need to do to make sure that this is a possibility so the next year at Final Hacking Live, I can come on stage and get one of those awards. That's my goal is make this the motivation, the thing, the anchor point for you to be able to say, look, that's the goal. That's the mission. This is what I'm going to go accomplish. And I was really nervous about that part. We thought, you know, let's show this documentary. Again, those things I'm worried like people are going to watch it, are they going to bounce and take lunch break and miss this part, not come back and come back for the presentations. But instead of people sat there, it served as that anchor that we needed to get people to like, this is where I'm trying to go. This is where I'm getting to. And the documentary serves such a good job to help set that vision and give people a north star to start running towards. So, I'm going to go crazy. I'm going to go crazy back here. Just go crazy. What's up? Back to star day number three and everybody's back here going crazy. I want to end just first off just telling you guys how grateful I am. Every single one of you guys, if you're here today, if you have that pull, you felt that call to contribution that Alex Sharfen talked about and you're here today, it's because there's a calling. There's something outside of yourself pulling you towards something to call the contribution. I tell people it's a calling from God and each of you guys have it. So, going into this event, the question was like, how do we know if this is a success or not? Right? Like we're doing this, there's a lot of work and effort and time and energy and everything like, and there were kind of two metrics that we were judging things on. Number one was leverage. You think about if I sit down in front of somebody for three days and I talk to him, you know, let's say it's eight hours a day for three days, that's what 24 hours of my time to help somebody understand something. And what's amazing about this is we had over 5,000 people registered to be part of this. Over 3,500 people were live at almost any session. You take 3,500 people times three days. I don't even know, thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of hours was able to go out and affect people. Each of them just affects one person's life. That's 5,000 more people's lives have changed. But if they're entrepreneurs, they learn how to use these businesses and these tools, what if they each of them helps 10 people or 100 people or 1,000? Right? And I have no idea who it is in this audience, like which ones are going to be the ones to do it. But that's why I love Fun Hacking Live is because I know that the time, the three days we put in, Fun Hacking Live starts a ripple effect that affects millions and hundreds of millions of people throughout the world. The second side of it obviously is we're a big believer in the value ladder. Obviously the yellow brick road, like where do we take our customers to? And for me, my goal is always to get customers into our hiring coaching programs where I can work with them closer. I can serve them at a closer level. We can do more for them. Part of the event we obviously made an offer for the Two Common Club X coaching program. And this is the first time we've ever opened it up, virtually ever. So the question is, will people buy things virtually that they wouldn't buy, they normally would buy at an event? You know, there's the energy of the room in an event. You can build in the table rush, you see all those kind of things in it. And so I think you lose a little bit of that virtually, but at the same time, we really get hundreds of people to join us in the Two Common Club X coaching program, which means when this process ends, it means I have the chance to work with them in a much smaller, more intimate group for the next 12 months or longer. That's a big win because when someone has a chance to come to our coaching programs, work with me, work with our coaches, we can take them so much further, so much faster. Like there's so many things that hold us back and you've got to be willing to get rid of those things so you can become who you need to be. So you can serve the people you've been called to serve. That's what this game is about. It is the most amazing personal development experience you will ever have. You'll learn so much about yourself. There's gonna be hard times, easy times, fun times, bad times, but at the end of it, who you become would be someone you'll be proud of. Ooh, Two Common Club. Don't get clicked for those. Bye-bye.
