Most entrepreneurs don't understand there are a few like core shifts you can make that can radically transform both success in your business but also in your life. So today I'm going to share with you guys five principles from this book right here and this book is not like a normal book. It was an internal document created for the employees that work at Ogilvy Advertising, one of the biggest advertising companies in the planet. It was never meant to be something that got released to the public. After it was released to the internal company, some people made some books from it. There are only a few copies on the planet. I finally was able to find a copy of this almost a year after I heard about it. I had every alert on Google, eBay, everything waiting for it and one popped up and I was able to grab this copy for $530 and I'm going to share with you guys the principles that took their business from zero to over $2 billion a year in sales. For these guys, the culture of how Ogilvy does advertising and their companies and how they're able to make as much money as they do all stems off of this core idea of the eternal pursuit of unhappiness. I actually want to read part of the intro. It says this book is about philosophy. It's about the ethos, beliefs and all those tweed jackery things which gentlemen with monocules love to yapp on about. Is there any consolation though this book is also about sex? It's written primarily to address the rather awkward question of can a $2 billion gorilla like Ogilvy ever be as svelte, sultry, and sexy? So talking about the Ogilvy agency, the answer to our dilemma can be summed up in two pithy words, divine discontent. Decades before advertising profits were preaching good enough, ain't good enough, Ogilvy was already practicing it. So these are some of these ideas, right? The pursuit of unhappiness, divine discontent, good enough, ain't good enough. These are the principles that it starts talking about in this book that are interesting because most people in any area of life are teaching the opposite, right? Everyone on happiness or personal development success are teaching the opposite of this. Whereas Ogilvy is talking about if you want to be successful, right? And again, this is their company cultural manual that's teaching like the culture of the company's whole like if you go from $2 billion into grow, it's about being divinely discontent, not happy with what the results are today. It's always constant improvement, constantly making things better. It's being willing to come back and look at things a lot differently than the way that the most of the world frames and talks about success. I wrote down a couple of my favorite takeaways from this book. I have here on my note card to make sure I don't miss any of them. These are all things again, they're like just different ways to look at how to actually be successful. And I think a lot of these are very controversial yet. I think that Ogilvy is correct. I'm curious to your thoughts, by the way, if you agree with these or not. So first one I have is the restlessness is a feature, not a bug. And it goes on to say, so the best entrepreneurs are those who are deeply unsatisfied. I think one of the superpowers that I have, if you ask me, why are you keep doing this? Why are you so obsessive? Why are you up like last time until midnight last night working with a programmers on this thing? And like, why are you always continually moving in and all sorts of stuff? And it's because nothing I'm not happy, but I'm not satisfied. Like I feel like what I'm able to do and able to create is so much more. Right. And so there's a gap between like the version of myself and the version of our companies that I believe is possible and where we are today, where a lot of people, because they're like those two things come together and it's just like, Oh, like I'm doing better than I thought, or I'm very happy and very successful that things start deteriorating very, very quickly. Again, you look at Ogilvy, $2 billion company, they're trying to figure out how do we grow, how do we stretch and you can't do that by being happy, right? So it's being deeply unsatisfied, which is such a hard thing because every voice that you listen to today from business and personal development is all about like, you're good enough and you're happy. And those things are true, but those things don't push progress. Those things don't break the next level. They're not things that give you the breakthroughs, right? It's when you're up at night and you're going to have this thing, like, I know that I'm built for more, like our company can do more, we're creative for more, like that discontent, that being unsatisfied is the thing that drives you to the next level. It's kind of like a clam. You put the sand in the clam, you know, and that irritation is what creates the pearls. Like what kind of sand, what kind of irritation can I put in to give me the uneasiness so that I will want to go out there and actually create more and do more. The next one that I was really interested in says, creator see problems where others see norms. The entrepreneurs don't just notice things, they feel them. I have a group called Atlas and in my Atlas group, we had Mark Ford. His nickname is Michael Masterson and he's one of the head guys that runs the GORE, which is the $2 billion a year info product business. And it was interesting because he was talking to this, my highest level group of entrepreneurs who have big businesses, who have a lot of employees and staff. And he said, one of the key jobs and roles of the entrepreneur is to be an agitator. He said, if you think about this, he's like, all businesses by default will eventually return back to zero. Left to their own devices, everything goes back to zero, zero profitability. And he's like, it takes the entrepreneur coming in being the agitator, being the one that's seeing the things and tweaking things and changing things that causes chaos for the rest of the team. Most of your employees will think that you're insane or they'll be tired of you. They hate that you go to another mastermind and you come back with 12 new ideas and you're shifting things around. But that's what keeps the business profitable and actually growing. Right? It's you being this agitator. And I think what I was reading that was very similar. Creators see the problems where other people see norms, right? Everyone else is like, this is fine. Things are working really good. But the entrepreneur, your job is to come in and be like, nah, like, that's not optimized. We should be doing this differently. I'm not happy. It's not feeling right. A lot of times, at least for me, I can't always like verbally explain like this is the problem. It's like these external feelings like something just doesn't feel right. I don't know if it's the market changing the customers, the audiences. It's the reason why when I am selling on a webinar, I still sell live and read the comments afterwards. So I'm trying to keep like my pulse on the market because you can start feeling these shifts and these changes and that is the job of the creator or the entrepreneur. The third one says happiness is temporary, but meaning is enduring. And this is an interesting one because you think about this, how many times in your life have you felt really, really happy? And I started thinking about this a little while ago and there were probably two periods in my life that I remember being the happiest, like where I was just like in a state of happiness. The first one was I was in high school, my junior year. I won the state title for wrestling and then I remember leaving and in the car ride home, just having this feeling like I did it. Like this is the thing I was working and like it was amazing, right? So much happiness. But then by the next day, it starts going away and then it's like you reach the goal and it goes away. The second time I felt that was when I spoke at Grant Cardone's 10X event. I remember we had set a goal, I did the presentation, we sold, we actually smashed our goal. My team was up in the one hotel room, taking all the order forms and processing stuff. My wife and I went back to our hotel room and we were laying in bed just shot, just so tired for months of like preparation and work. I remember we took this picture of us. That was like one of the moments of my life when I was the most happy. Winning a war or winning a football game or something like laying on the field just exhausted. Like if those things happen, they're temporary, they leave, right? And so the second half of this is like if happiness is temporary, then what is the thing that lasts? And it says that meaning is enduring. Like the meaning you're attaching to these situations and these ideas. Like what is the meaning you're attaching to everything, right? That's what actually lasts the longest. If you study Tony Robbins, he talks a lot about your ability to attach a meaning to like the different meanings you attach things, how it shifts to the destiny for everything, right? It says right here from the book, it says, this isn't about being miserable. It's about trading the fleeting dopamine achievement for a lifelong identity as a maker. Builders aren't chasing happiness, they're chasing momentum, impact, challenge and flow. And so the question is like, are you trying to just be happy or you're trying to matter? Like what's the meaning you're trying to attach to your work, to the art you're putting out there? And what's the meaning you want other people to attach when they see what you're doing? Next one is build what you wish existed even if no one asks for it. And this is one the most successful entrepreneurs I know that's exactly what they did. They're not necessarily building something that maybe their customers are asking for, but they're building a thing that they wish they had. And for me specifically, ClickFunnels literally is that. Like when we built ClickFunnels, it was because for a decade prior, me and Todd Dickerson and my partners, we would hand build these funnels over and like, right, we just want this tool for ourselves. Like we had this for ourselves, it would change everything. And that became the focal point, I came to the driving point. What do we actually want? Like even if we never sold a copy to anybody, like if no one ever signed for ClickFunnels, it would still make us so much money because it was the thing that we were missing, the thing that we wanted the most, right? And I think for you, it's like understanding that like, where's the thing in your life or your business or whatever it is that's the biggest pain point for you that you wish existed. And then the last one here that thought was really fascinating talks about the fact that the most valuable founders are obsessive outliers. So the Goldblades study founders who built generational companies. And the one thing they all shared was obsession, not work life balance, not 10% side projects, obsession. I was speaking in Mexico, this big mastermind in paradise, we do, TharClickFunnels members, somebody asked me the question, they said, Russell, how do you have such a balanced life? And I sat there for a minute and I was like, do I end like the way they want, like they want me to know like, this is what I do, like I spend three percent of my time here and fight, they wanted to like, figure out how I have my life together so they could model like how I balance my life. And I was like, I need to tell these guys the truth. I was like, for me, everything amazing in my life came from times of radical imbalance. It wasn't from having a balanced life. You may look at me now like, Russell, your life's really balanced. If you look at like the actual journey of my last 45 years here on this planet, like I had a balanced life up until I was like 15, I was just waking up every morning doing the normal stuff and I was happy. I was just doing the motions and I got into wrestling and I became obsessed with it, right? And I had this radical imbalance. 98% of my life was all focused on wrestling. Because of that, I became a great wrestler. I was a state champion. I took second place in the nation. I was an all-American. I had a chance to wrestle in college, but everything else suffered. I had horrible grades. I struggled with relationships. I had a lot of friends like because that became my obsession. And then I get into college. I meet my beautiful wife, Claire, right? And I'm realizing like, if I'm going to make this relationship work, I can't take the 2% of wrestling and like focus on her. Like I need to have extreme unbalance with her, right? So my life became very extremely unbalanced. It's for my time and focus and attention to build and to nurture that relationship. And from that, blossoms into a beautiful relationship. Now we have five kids. We're married for, I should know this 24, 25 years for a long time, right? We came from radical imbalance. When Todd and I decided to build click funnels, both of us, it became radical imbalance where we're literally working 18, 20 hours a day to take this idea from idea to fruition, right? It came from radical imbalance. You know, Todd lives in Atlanta. I live in Boise and we used to have shift hours. I would stay up till three or four in the morning, which is like five or six a Todd's time. He would wake up. We'd pass notes on like baton and what we're working on and he would work all day. I'd sleep at night and then I'd pop up and like between the two of us, we were working 24 hours a day, seven days a week for over a year to create the foundation when it eventually became click funnels. It's really understanding to be successful in business and advertising anything. Like the principle is in here, the eternal pursuit of unhappiness. Again, it's such a backwards title from what any of us will verbally say, but being divinely discontent, having obsession, making sure you're not complacent. Like those are the things that create amazing things. There was a season where everyone was like the hustle culture and like that was what everyone talked about and everyone's like what anti-hustle culture and I was like, no, like balance moderation. I think that there's this happiness in between being divinely discontent is what creates empires. It creates great marriages, what creates great relationships, what creates success in athletics and sports and music, whatever it is you want to pursue in this life is understanding those things. And so I love this book. Again, it's a manual literally for the people who work at all, glovy advertising. I was lucky enough to get a copy of it. You can find one. It's worth it. Find the book. It is a short or you can read it in less than an hour. It's the playbook for companies doing $2 billion a year in sales. And there's not many of those out there from actual founders who've been doing it and been doing it for as long as the Ogilvy company has been doing. All right. If you want to get my notes from the Atron pursuit of unhappiness, I will drop a link in the comments down below. Click on that. You can get the notes and hopefully they'll give you guys a bird's eye view of all the cool magic that came from this book while you were waiting to get your copy whenever you have a chance to find one for sale. Again, Scour, eBay, use bookstores, anywhere. There's a couple of people selling knockoff copies. I wouldn't get those unless you really want to read it. But if you can get your hands on one of these, it's worth this weight in gold.
