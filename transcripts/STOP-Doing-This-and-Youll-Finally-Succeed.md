99% of people in this world fail because they can't conquer one thing. This book right here is one of my favorite books of all time. They teach you how to overcome resistance. Every single one of us feels resistance every single day. Most of us multiple times throughout the day. Every time the alarm clock goes off, you feel resistance. Like, I want to turn it off, right? You want to check your phone. You want to scroll one more time. You want to watch one more episode on Netflix. Like, there's these things that keep holding us back. So I think it's some external force. I don't have the time, the money, the energy, but the reality is all of us have the same resources. The thing that keeps you from being successful is learning how to control resistance. When you can control the internal resistance you're having, then externally you can achieve the things you want in life. This book that you haven't read before is called The War of Art by Steven Pressfield, one of my favorite authors of all time. I'm going to walk through four different steps to help you to overcome resistance so you can get your goals, accomplish your dreams, and change the world. All right, with that said, I'm going to walk you guys through the four steps that you need to learn to be able to overcome resistance in your life. And over here we got them. So these are the four steps to actually beat resistance. If it's been holding you back for any amount of time, today is the day. It's going to be gone forever. I'm so excited for you to learn these things. All right, so step number one is called Expose the Enemy. First thing you need to do is understand exactly what resistance is, okay? A lot of people don't even know this. The internal force is the thing that's keeping them from success. It's happening every single day over and over and over and over again. So what is resistance? Well, inside of the book The War of Art, in here he's talking about people who are creating some type of art, right? So everyone's got a different art. Some of you guys are writers or you're designers or you're content creators or you're an athlete, but everyone's got a different art, right? And so The War of Art is this internal war we're having as we're trying to create our art. And obviously Stephen is a writer, so he's using a lot of these metaphors in terms of someone who's an author who's writing, but it's true for anybody, right? So this is what he says. He says, there's a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don't. And the secret is this. It's not the writing part that's hard. It's sitting down to write. What keeps us from sitting down is called resistance. I could replace this with any type of art. Let's say for example, you are a bodybuilding or trying to get in shape, right? Or maybe not a bodybuilding, you're just out of shape and you want to get in shape. So I might say the same sentence, like the secret that people who are in shape know that the people who aren't in shape don't know is this. It's not the working out that's hard, right? It's the getting to the gym that's the hard part. What keeps you from getting to the gym is resistance. So when you think about this inside your life, like what are all of the times the resistance is hitting you? I had some of my clients do this one time, we sat down and said for an entire 24 hour period of time, let's map out every time resistance hits. I did the exercise with them. The craziest thing is my alarm goes off every morning at 4.50. The alarm goes off at 4.50. First thing is I turn it off and instantly within a half a second, waking up, resistance hits me and goes roll back over and go back to bed. So I grab my pad of paper on like 4.50 a.m. resistance wanted me to go back to bed, right? Then I get out of bed, it's cold and my resistance is like get back in bed, it's cold. Hit it again. By the time it was like five o'clock in the morning, resistance already tried to stop me at ten times. It was crazy for me. As soon as I became aware of the enemy, as soon as I was able to understand this is who it is, then I was able to address it and figure out ways to protect myself from the enemy. That's why step number one is exposing the enemy. One thing Prestfield talks about here inside the book, he talks about what he calls the unlived life. He says it's the athlete who doesn't compete or it's the rider who never writes or it's the painter who never paints or the entrepreneur who never actually starts his own business. For most of us in parts of our life, we're not doing that, we're not living the life that we were called to actually live. That is the very first thing to understand is to understand who the enemy is because when you're aware of it, now we can actually beat it. Which now brings me to step number two in beating resistance. Step number two is this. It's ready for this. It's understanding the lives of resistance. Resistance is going to give you a whole bunch of lives to keep you from being successful. I'm going to walk you through a couple of these lives that most of us hit every single day. The first lie is the lie of procrastination. This is one of the worst lies that resistance is used because resistance is not going to tell you, oh, don't go to the gym. It's going to say, go to the gym tomorrow. Resistance is not going to say, don't write the book. It's going to say, I'm going to write the book tomorrow. It's trying to get us to procrastinate the thing. This is what's fascinating for most people I know about you. If we procrastinate something until tomorrow, until Mannyana, when Mannyana comes, what happens? They get procrastinating the next day and the next day until we never actually get things done. It happens for all of us in every single area of our life. The second thing that the very first lie that resistance is going to tell to you is procrastination. Not that you're not going to do the thing, but you're going to do it later. When you understand that, right? And I know my enemy, I know when procrastination is coming, I'm saying, that's resistance. I got to stop that. I cannot procrastinate. I got to take action today. The second lie is what's called the shadow calling. This is where resistance will allow you to do a version of what you're called to do, but not actually the thing that you were called to do. For example, with Steven Pressfield in this book, he talks about for a long time he wanted to be a writer. He wanted to write books. He wanted a great screen place for movies, all sorts of stuff. And eventually he actually did. But if you didn't know this, he's the one that wrote the screenplay for the movie Bag or Vance. With Will Smith, like one of the best movies of all time. He wrote that. But it took him like 40 years of writing before he did this. Okay? First, he was doing writing copy for advertising companies. Then he was writing scripts for these projects he didn't like. He never actually did the thing he wanted. He was doing a shadow version of it. His calling was to write books, to write screenplays. And he was doing a version of it, right? He was writing copy for her clients. He was doing things. He was other projects he was writing, but he wasn't pulling into his calling. Now, shadow calling is a metaphor for your real calling. Okay? It looks very, very similar. The difference is there's no risk if you fail inside the shadow calling. That's why resistance allows you to do that, right? If you're writing for somebody else and it doesn't work, it doesn't really matter. For you to put yourself out there and to write something and put it out into the world, right? There's consequences if it doesn't work. It's scary. It's fearful. So resistance is always trying to push you to a shadow calling. That's line number two, is that the shadow calling is your actual real calling. Line number three is what we call pleasure not fulfillment. Okay? Resistance is always trying to get you a cheaper form of the thing you actually desire the most. It's trying to give you the dopamine hit. We get the reward without the actual effort. Okay? Nothing good comes in life when you're getting just the reward without the effort that goes into it. And this is true in all sorts of things. A couple of examples I wrote down. Number one is having an actual relationship with somebody you love versus pornography, right? One, you get the reward without the risk. Number two, you get actual fulfillment. Reading about something all day long but not actually doing it, right? How many of us are reading? I'm just saying podcasts on the night. Going through the motions but we're never actually doing the thing that we're called to do. Okay? Another one, I have so many friends that get in this trap where they go to school and they keep going to school and they keep going to school and they're so scared to get out of school system because they don't want to actually do the work. And then line number four, this is one step deeper than a shadow calling. You're kind of in the thing. Step number four, line number four is literally full sedation. When you're just sedated, you're trying to like not even focus on the dream. You're getting into drugs and alcohol. You're trying to get your brain away from the pain of knowing that you're not living into your calling. So these are the lives the resistance has given you to keep you from stepping into your actual calling. All right? You guys ready for step number three on how to beat resistance? This one is one of my favorites of all time. This one is really cool. It is called the bigger the dream, the bigger the resistance. Now I hear people say all the time, they come to me like, hey Russell, I want to do this thing but man, there were so many obstacles, so many things that are happening that like there must be a sign this is not something for me to actually do, right? If I was supposed to, this would be easier. And so they step away from their calling because of the trials and the headaches and the heartaches that come when they're trying to pursue the thing, right? And this is the reality. That's not true. The opposite is actually true. Now I was lucky enough after reading this book and freaking out because it's one of my favorites of all time, I messaged the author Stephen Pressfield. I said, can I interview you for a few minutes? I want to find out some more stuff about resistance, how I could beat it inside of my own life. And luckily for me and for you, he said yes. And so I actually have a clip over here of Stephen Pressfield from my interview and I want to show this clip specifically because he's talking about this concept of the bigger the dream you have, the bigger resistance is going to be. So with that said, let's check out this clip from the man himself, Stephen Pressfield. Imagine a tree in the middle of a sunny meadow. The minute the tree appears, a shadow appears. And the shadow is equal to the tree, right? If it's a big tree, it's a big shadow. So in the terms of resistance, the tree is the dream that you have. The book you want to write, the venture you want to do, whatever. And resistance is the shadow. So there would not, what I want to say is resistance always comes second. There would be no resistance if there wasn't a dream, if there wasn't a calling that was inside you. So the good news of that is when you're feeling big resistance, that big shadow, that shows that there's a big tree there or something. There's a big dreams because resistance always comes like Newton's third law of motion equal an opposite reaction. It's a reaction to an aspiration, to a book you want to write or a movie you want, whatever it is. So don't be freaked out, I would say to anybody, buy that dark cloud, that dark shadow is an indication that the dream is for real and it's big. Okay. So that is the key for you guys to understand, right? The bigger the dream, the bigger the resistance. Okay. If you have a big dream, you start pursuing it, it gets hard. It doesn't mean it's not meant to be. No, it means that it is meant to be, right? The greatest things in life don't come from simplicity. It comes through the pain, through the hard work, right? It's going through the effort, the risk, the trials and from the other side that is when the greatest things come out. So understanding step number three here is that the bigger the dream, the bigger the resistance and that's okay. Okay. For me now in my life, I'm going after something bigger and I'm like, man, the resistance is huge here. I get doubled down, like even more excited knowing that it means that this calling, this thing that I'm chasing, the thing I'm pursuing is something that's going to change a lot of people's lives. The same thing is true for you. Okay. So when you're in your own personal war of art, when you're trying to create your art, whatever that thing is for you and you feel the big resistance, don't step away from it. Lean into it knowing that means you're on the right track. Okay. That brings me to step number four. So how do we actually beat this thing, right? Obviously, we have to come aware of it. Number two, we have to understand the lies it's using to beat us. Number three, we have to understand that even if the resistance feels so heavy and so big that we can't pursue it knowing that that is a sign that you are on the right path, the last step here is then how do we beat it? And this is where my favorite ones and the reality is the way we beat it is through action. And you've heard people talk about this before, but this is the key to actually beating resistance. Okay. Now in life, there's different types of motion, right? There's circular motion. Okay. And most people get stuck in a circular motion where they're just kind of spinning their wheels. They're going around these ruts over and over and they're never progressing. They're never moving forward. Okay. How many of you guys feel like that sometimes? Maybe feel like that right now. The point he'll calls that drifting, because we drift into this hypnotic rhythm where we're just like, nothing's changed in our life. It keeps us succumbing to resistance and so nothing ever progresses. The second type of motion is forward is taking action. You're actually moving forward, right? Now the problem with direction is when you decide to move forward, there's always a cost. Right? Sitting here and drifting is no cost. You're just kind of bouncing off the wall. It's doing the same thing over and over again. When you decide to move forward into momentum and actually take action, there's a cost, which is why it's scary, why it's hard. It's why the resistance starts coming every time you decide to move forward. Right? When you're creating your art and you decide to move forward, there's always going to be that resistance. Okay? The reason why is that our brains are programmed naturally to do a couple things. Okay? One thing our brain is naturally built and hard coding our brain to do is to avoid pain at all costs. Right? You feel pain. It's like, I don't want to go there. I don't want to do that. Okay? So our brain tries to avoid pain number one. Number two, our brain is trained to seek pleasure. I think we'll find the fastest hit of pleasure possible. How to get my dope meat as quick as possible. Right? On my phone, whenever we can do, we try to get seek pleasure. Number three is our brain wants us to conserve energy, conserve calories so you don't run out of the calories we need to survive. And then number four is our brain wants to prove itself right. We call this confirmation bias. Okay? So those are four things. Our brain wants to avoid pain, seek pleasure, conserve energy, improve itself right. Now to be successful and to beat resistance, you literally have to do the exact opposite of what your brain has been trained to do. Okay? So instead of avoiding pain, we have to move out of our comfort zone over and over and over again. Right? Create your arts, not going to be simple. Writing books is not simple. So not only do we can't avoid pain, but it's a step into the pain. Okay? Number two, instead of seeking pleasure at any cost we can, to be successful in any area of life, you have to actually delay gratification. You have to allow that to build up before you get the reward. Number three, instead of conserving energy, to be successful, you have to take massive action. That's the opposite of conserving energy, right? It's waking up early. It's doing the things that your brain does not want to do. Okay? And then number four, to be successful, you can't just try to prove yourself right. To be successful in any way, you have to question your beliefs, question your assumptions, and become teachable and becoming a student. So those are the steps for how you can beat resistance. Now I want to give you as one more key to being successful at this. Okay? Every single time you do something, right, you start moving forward, you're into a direction instantly, just like Stephen Pressville talked about. As soon as you do that, resistance is going to show up. Okay? By default, our brain quickly wants to go back to drifting, the simpler version of it, right? So what's our job? Okay? There's a quote from Victor Frankel, it's one of my favorites. He says, between the stimulus and the response, there's a space. And in that space lies our freedom and our power to choose our responses. In our response lies our growth and freedom. So as soon as resistance hits us, there's a space, right? Most people hit resistance, they give up. For all of you guys, as soon as you hit resistance, there's this little gap of space where you actually have the ability to choose and say, no, I'm going to move forward. No, I'm not gonna believe that lie. No, I'm not gonna procrastinate. And that's where all success and growth and happiness comes. So that is what resistance is. That's why The War of Art is literally one of my favorite books of all time. This is one, I say about once a month I read it or listen to the audio book. The nice thing is it's really short. It is the key to help you to overcome resistance in your life because the reality is like you being successful, not successful is almost never about the external circumstances. It's not about your resources, about the money you don't have, the time you don't have. It's almost always an internal thing. It's the fight and the battle you're having with your brain every single day. Resistance is that thing that's trying to keep you back from being successful. So if you have art that you know you are called to create, to change people's lives. Again, it could be a business you're launching. It could be a video on YouTube you wanna make. It could be a podcast. It could be anything. Whatever your art is, if you wanna learn how to win this war of art, to beat resistance, to be successful, this book is one of my favorites. I hope you guys love it. A couple of really cool things. Number one, I did this entire interview of Stephen Pressville. It is insane.
