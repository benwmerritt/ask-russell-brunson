I had a client who came to me and said, I want to work with you as a marketer, but there's one condition. I was like, okay, what is it? She said, you have to build in ClickFunnels. I was like, what's ClickFunnels? And so I went and I looked at the software and she was so adamant about this. And so I think her confidence level that she wasn't willing to look at any other software and it had to be in ClickFunnels caused me to like scrape. I'm like, what's the deal? So I started working in ClickFunnels, you know, and then I discovered Russell Brunson and I realized why she was so loyal to the software because it is the best in the world. There is no other program that does what ClickFunnels does. And I was like, oh, no kidding, okay. And so I quickly got my own account realizing and I started building funnels. And I think one of the things that the software does that no other software does quite as well is it brings you the marketing training and mindset along with the software to implement it. And no other software does that. When I started absorbing sales funnels for myself and then started pushing it out to my customers, they were so happy because they started making money. The stress of like some cool website was gone. Like they could maintain it. And so ClickFunnels like built my business and then it helped me build all these other people's businesses as well. And I realized how much agency owners and service providers if they just go after the result of what the client wants, like there's so much work out there waiting for you. It's crazy. My agency went from like small web design where I was pulling my hair out to a full marketing agency with funnels and ads. And I was making $20,000, $25,000 a month as a small little agency owner. And the house we're standing in today is because of that switch that happened in my business. Eventually I had so many clients on ClickFunnels that my affiliate revenue started to almost equal my service-based revenue, right? So I was making like five figures a month just passively on the ClickFunnels affiliate program. I was also the first woman to win their dream car. What happened in that was that it relieved a lot of the pressure in my agency because I was a very small. I was not going to scale. I just wanted to stay little. This passive revenue started to create this undercurrent foundation so that I didn't have to take every client. And if you are a service provider and you need money, you know the battle that happens when you're like, this is not my idea of client, but I need the money. And so I was able to say no to those people because I had that money coming in every month regularly. It allowed me to find the clients that I really wanted to work with. And you know, the funny thing happened is that because I got less desperate and I got more sure of who I wanted to serve, it actually attracted more people because now they were like waiting in line to work with me. If you're an agency or a freelancer or just you have the entrepreneurial bug, but you feel like you don't fit the normal stereotype, I didn't either. My life has changed. I get to work from home. I get to have a beautiful farmhouse for all my kids and I get to enjoy financial security. And that is all because of that one moment in time when I decided to say, all right, I'm gonna dig into this and see what ClickFunnels is all about. So I would encourage anybody who's thinking about being in their own business or they already are a freelancer or an agency to give ClickFunnels a chance because it may just change your whole life.
