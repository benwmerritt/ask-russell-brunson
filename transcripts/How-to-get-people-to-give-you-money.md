I want somebody to buy something from me. I got to get them to believe something. What's the one thing they have to believe? They believe this one thing that they have to give me money. So the topic that we're going to be talking about right now is how to create belief. It's interesting, like I used to think that our job as marketers was to sell people's stuff. So I learned all these sales skills, I read all the sales books and like had a close and all these kind of things. And it got me to a spot, but I couldn't grow beyond that. Like it was just it was stagnant and it wasn't inspiring. It didn't cause like the change in people's lives that I wanted to have, right? Selling is good because you make money. That's nice, right? But what's better is when you're doing it in a way that like causes beliefs to change in people, which causes them to move and cause them to change their lives as well. And that's like the fascinating, like the coolest part about this. The first thing is this concept of the one thing. So I was at an event four or five years ago and listening to a bunch of great marketers are sitting in the audience and Tim Ferriss was on stage. How many of you guys have ever seen Tim Ferriss before or heard him read his books? And he's on stage and somebody came up during the Q&A session and asked him this, like, so Tim Ferriss, what's your day look like? And he kind of laughed. He said, you know what? I get asked that all the time and people have asked if they come film day in the life of Tim Ferriss. He's like, I always tell him, no, and you want to know why? He said, most people wake up in the morning, they got us to do this of a thousand things and they're doing thing after thing after thing after all these kind of things trying to get done and they're busy and they're moving all the time. He's like, look at my life. It's not that way at all. He's like, I wake up in the morning, I drink some coffee or some tea, sit there and I think and then I read that I go on a walk and I'm thinking and I'll do that for three or four or five weeks before I ever do anything. He said, what I'm doing those I'm trying to spend that time thinking about not all the millions of dominoes I got to knock down. I'm trying to identify what's the one huge domino. If I can knock that thing down, we'll knock down every other domino that's in the way or make the rest of them irrelevant. And we said that I had this like, ah, on my head. I was like, that's the key. And then a little while later, I was talking to my friend, Perry Belcher, one of the owners at Digital Marketer and Perry was saying, he said, the interesting thing at that, he said, we went through all the offers we've created in the last 10 years. He said, anytime we ask somebody to believe more than one thing in our sales message, it was always a bomb. He said, if we, if the message, the core message got them to believe just one thing, those were our winners every single time. And so I started thinking about that. I started like realizing that if I want somebody to buy something from me, I got to get them to believe something. Like what's, what's the one thing they have to believe? They believe this one thing that they have to give me money. Like what is that thing? And so for all of you guys, it's going to be different. We did an event for our inner circle members probably eight or nine months ago. And I was talking about this and I was planning on spending about 15 minutes on it. As we started going deeper and deeper, we ended up spending about three hours trying to figure out this thing. And from that three hour session popped out one sentence that was the key. Do you guys want to see the sentence? All right, this is what it is. If I can make them believe that my new opportunity is the key to whatever they desire most, and it's only attainable through my specific vehicle, then all other objections and concerns become irrelevant. They have to give me money. That's the key. But this seems really, really easy until you start doing it. And it's not. It takes a while. So I'm going to show you guys a couple of examples. So for my business, this is what my nominal statement would look like. If I can get them to believe that funnels is the key to their online business success and it's only attainable through click funnels, if they honestly that I have, for me to be successful, I have to have a funnel. And the only way to have a funnel is click funnels. If you honestly believe that you have to give me money, there's no other. If you don't give me money, you're lying to yourself. So if you guys want to think through your business, like can you create that statement for what it is you're selling? There's a network marketing company called Proovit. And I helped them build out some of their initial messaging and sales funnels. And we got some approvers here in the audience. And so for that group, when we were kind of working through like how I was going to write the sales pitch and the messaging for them, this is what I came up with. Okay. If I can make them believe that getting their body into state of ketosis is the key to losing weight and it's only attainable through drinking Proovit's ketones, then all other objections and concerns become irrelevant and they have to give me money. Do you see how much stronger that is? So that is the key. So all you guys think for a second for yourself, what would this sentence be for you? What would the big domino statement be for you? So tonight this is your homework assignment. I want all of you guys to create a domino statement. And at first you can think it's to take 10 seconds and an hour into it, you can be like, gosh, this is harder than I thought. It turns out I'm selling an improvement offer. Huh. Turns out I am in a red ocean with everybody else. Huh. This statement makes you, makes all this stuff we talked about earlier have to happen. It can't not happen unless you, if you fit in the statement. Okay. So that's it. Thanks for watching. I'll see you guys next time. Bye. Bye.
