## Transcript
Hey, my name is Russell Brunson and I'm coming to you right now from Secret Location in one of my offices inside of my safe to show you guys something really, really cool. But the whole context of this video is how can you change the world? Maybe not the world as a whole, but your world, you change the world, the people you've been called to serve. There's a way you do that that's really powerful, a lot of fun. And so I want to talk to you about it. But before I do, I've got something to hear my safe. It is a manuscript from a book that's become my favorite book in the entire world that kind of gives a hint about why most people struggle. In fact, this book talks about the fact that 98% of all people in the world are what they call drifters. They're not actually working towards something. It's like goals, they're not trying to pursue or trying to create or trying to dream. They're just drifting. That only 2% of the population are actually the creators of what I call the prime movers in society. Those who are trying to change the world. And this book is, it's insane. I'm curious right now, you guys watching, can you guess which book it is? This is a book that was actually written in 1937, a year after this author wrote another book that sold I think over 100 million copies, but he never published it in his lifetime because it was too controversial. He was just scared to publish it. It wasn't until a dozen years later that someone at the foundation found it and read it and said this is probably the most prolific book that he ever wrote. And so they ended up publishing it and now this book has gone on to sell over 40 million copies. It was my favorite. And inside the safe, I had the actual manuscript from his typewriter into these pages. You guys want to see it? So I'm going to pull that real quick and then I'll actually show you guys inside and kind of take you guys on a journey. So the last guess, you guys guess what the book is? All right, make it simple. The author is my favorite author. He's probably the owner of Napoleon Hill, thinking girl rich in 1937. 1938, he wrote this book which is called Outwitting the Devil. This is the box I had the manuscript beside. I'm going to take you back into the other room where I can show you guys what it actually looks like. Okay, so like I said, this book is called Outwitting the Devil. I create these boxes to protect stuff that's really valuable, really rare. What is inside here is one of the coolest things that I own. The Napoleon Hill Foundation sent this to me as a gift. This is the actual book I pulled out here called Outwitting the Devil. If you haven't read it yet, this is the best thing that Napoleon Hill ever wrote. The book is great if you are able to add highly recommend the audio book because this book is the conversation between Napoleon Hill and the devil. They're debating back and forth. The devil is basically on trial and Napoleon Hill can ask him any question he wants, he has to answer. And the question is like, how do you keep men from being successful? What do you do? And the devil's whole premise is he tries to make men become drifters. In fact, there's a section called Drifting with the Devil. That's the angle, right? How do you get people to become drifters? And like you said, 98% of the population are drifters, only 2% are the driven. Those who are trying to change the world, those that I call prime movers. And so this is the book. Again, if you listen to the audio book, it's amazing because the two voice actors are awesome. Describe all the ways in which you induce people to drift. People who think for themselves never drift, while those who do little or no thinking for themselves are drifters. This is my favorite part. So check this out. This right here is the actual manuscript from Napoleon Hill's typewriter for outwitting the devil. The first page is actually signed by his wife, Annie Lu. Annie Lu Hill right here. Like finding rare first-season books is really, really cool, but finding a manuscript is insane. Check it out. Here's the title page, which says, Dedicate all people who have courage to acquire knowledge and accept facts which may not harmonize with their own personal beliefs, with the hope that this volume may open to them new past truth, which would bring harmony out of chaos in this age of frustration and fear, the author. I don't know, kind of an age of frustration and fear as well. So maybe this will be helpful for all of us. Anyway, so I wanted to show you guys this because the first time I heard this principle of people being drifters was from this book and how the majority of people, as you know, you look around society, the majority of people aren't doing anything, right? They are drifting. Like usually they start when they're young and they're, they have the inspiration, they're excited, they're trying to change the world, they start moving through this process and then something happens to them and they stop trying, they stop progressing, they shift from, from this growth mindset to becoming someone who is a drifter. So there's two different things. There's people who drift and there's people who are driven, right? Obviously, those who I talk to in my communities and our live events here on the YouTube channel are people who are the 2%, right? They are the people who are driven. They are people who I call prime movers. And I want to talk to you like, what is a prime mover? This is a word that I use a lot. People keep seeing me wear the t-shirts more and more often, like, what is a prime mover? We keep talking about prime mover. What is a prime mover? In Ayan Rand's book, Atlas Shrugged and Fountainhead, two of her books, she talks about this concept of a prime mover. And she says, you think about in a train, what is a prime mover of a train, right? It's the engines, the, it pulls the entire train. You know, the prime mover of you as a human is your brain. It's the thing that's like moving you around, right? And inside of our society, they're prime movers. These are people who act not who are acted upon. And it could be anyone from an artist, from an entrepreneur, from an athlete. It's the people who are out there who are trying to change the world, who are going out there doing things. I know that if you're here, you're probably one of those people who are driven. Someone who is a prime mover would consider themselves one and you're trying to figure out how to change the world and how to actually do that. And so I want to make this video about like, how do you actually change the world? What does that look like? And you may be thinking like, Russell, why are you even qualified to talk about this? Maybe I'm not. But it's something I'm very passionate about primarily because when I was growing up when I was younger, I was an athlete and I did really well in wrestling. I was a state champion. I took second place in the country. I wrestled at the Division I school. And that was my first time like trying to do something, trying to change my own world. And later I became an entrepreneur and I built multiple businesses. My biggest company is called ClickFunnels. Many of you guys have heard of it. I've written three books and I've had a chance to help thousands of people be successful in life. And so I consider myself someone who's driven. Like I'm always creating and trying to figure things out. And so in this process of me not only figuring these things out for myself but also helping other people, I'm always thinking about like, what are the things that go into somebody who's actually driven versus someone who's a drifter? The first thing I want to share with you is this concept I learned from Tony Robbins. I've done other videos about this but I want to talk about it inside the context of becoming a prime mover. Tony talks about this concept called the six human needs. This is my favorite things that he teaches people. So I'm going to do this out just to have some context of what these six human needs are because this is going to help you to see where the breakoff is between a drifter and someone who's actually driven. So what Tony Robbins says, he says basically when somebody does anything in life it's because of one of six things. It's always one of these six things, right? And the first four are what he calls the needs of the body or the personality. And then the second two needs are the needs of the spirit. So the first need that all these humans have is a thing called certainty. We want to be certain that every morning we're going to wake up, there's going to be food on the table, we're going to have something to do, like we crave that certainty, right? We want to have that certainty. That's the first of the human needs. The second need is called variety. Variety is literally the opposite of certainty. Certainties knowing exactly what's going to happen, what's going to happen with absolute certainty. Variety is having no idea what's going to happen, excitement, surprise, all sorts of stuff, right? So it's kind of this conundrum that we have as humans where like we have to have certainty, we have to have variety in their opposites and so that causes some commotion with us, right? But these are the first two needs, certainty and variety. Okay, and again, these two, I'm going to pull an arrow here because these two are opposites, but we need them both. Number three need is significance. You want to feel special, you want to feel important, like I'm very significant, look how great I am, right? You want people to see what you're doing. That's number three. And then need number four is called love and connection. We all crave love and connection, but what is love and connection? It's the opposite of significance. Significance is all about look how great I am. What's love and connection is about look how great you are. I love this person, I want to be connected to them, right? So again, these two things, just like the first two are also opposites. So we have these four, these four needs. Now most people in this world, they struggle just trying to get these needs met. But Tony said it was so interesting, he said, anytime that three of these four needs are met in your life, it'll cause an addiction. So thinking about this, like when you first met your spouse, right? First time I met my wife, Kolea, I saw her, I was like, she is gorgeous. I wanted to be connected. I love and connection, right? Like that was really fun. And then we go on these fun dates, like we went ice skating and bowling and all these great things, right? We had a variety. It was so much fun. And then she thought, I was cute, which made me feel significant, right? So three things were met and boom, instantly it created an addiction inside of my body. We fell in love and it was great, right? And what happens to people fall out of love is when the variety goes away or something that breaks from having three of the four needs met to just two, that's what usually when people break up or whatever might happen, right? And so for us as humans, we're always fighting at these needs met and we're always going to get them to met in one way or the other. A lot of times it's positive, other times it's very negative, right? Like in a relationship, if I'm in a relationship and I'm not getting my needs met, guess what usually happens? You start looking for needs in other places. I think about my wife when we got married, once again, we were dating, we had variety, significance, love and connection, right? And then we wanted to get married because I wanted certainty. I wanted certainty. Every morning I was awake and my wife was going to be there. So we got married and boom, all four needs are met and it's like this heavenly thing, right? Everything's perfect. And then what happens? Well, typically it happened for us is we stopped going as my dates. We lost variety, right? After a little while, after she's heard all my stories 500 times and she stops thinking I'm as cool as I am, then we lose a little significance and all of a sudden it breaks down. And luckily for my wife and I, we went to Tony Robbins event and this is one of the things he taught me that changed everything. I realized that if I can make her needs met, then she's not going to wander. And same thing if she can make my needs wet, we're going to be connected better, right? So we focused on that. And so in all aspects of life, we're trying to get these needs met. These are the needs of the body or he calls it the personality. Again, what most people do, they spend their whole life trying to get these needs met and that's where they get stuck, right? They get stuck into what Napoleon calls hypnotic rhythm where they just keep going around trying to figure out how in the world to get these needs met. Now, the next two needs are the needs of the spirit. Now, this is kind of like if you ever study the laws of hierarchy of needs, this is back in junior high and we're learning this. Basically, there's this pyramid of hierarchy of needs, right? First thing you have to do the first thing that which is like home and shelter or something, right? You'd move up this ladder, we get the next thing you need to met next thing you met, like until the base needs are met, you don't move up to the next needs until those ones are met, you don't move the next ones, right? And then when you down here, like you lose your home or your job or your shelter, also everything draws back down to the to that need to get that solved, right? Now, this works the same way, like you have to have the needs of your body figured out before you're able to move on to the needs of your spirit, which by most people don't ever actually do that. That's why I'm saying that people who are stuck in drifting is because they're just trying to get their needs met. They're trying to get certainty and variety and they're doing all sorts of things and they never get past that, right? This is like self mastery. You get through the four needs of the body and the personality and you figure out how to get your needs met in ways that actually like are productive for you, right? Those needs are met, then you can move up to the needs of the spirit. The next needs are my favorite. Number five, growth, personal development, how do you get better at something, right? And number six is contribution. Contribution is helping other people, right? And so for me, when I look at this transition between people who are drifting and people who are driven, prime movers of the people who have mastered their body and they have moved on to the needs of the spirit. They're the ones who are growing and contributing, growth and contribution, growth and contribution, focusing there. That's what I talk about mostly now is like if you know the transitions you get to growth and contribution, after you figure that out and you're saying that I'm driven, I want to become a prime mover, I want to change people's lives, it's come down to extreme focus on these two things, growth and contribution. How do we do it over and over and over again? And actually doodle this, how does the picture design, I'll have them overlay this on the video here. I was thinking about prime movers. They are the people who are holding away the world on their shoulders. You feel that way? Like you're holding away the world on your shoulders for your family, for your friends, for your employees, for your staff, for your team, for your community. You feel that way is traditionally how prime movers feel, right? Again, they are those who are acting not being acted upon. They're the people who are trying to change the world. There's three core things that we need to be focusing on as prime movers consistently to be able to grow, right? The first thing is our mind. It's our personal realm. It's figuring out how to control our brain. What's interesting about this, especially people who I find that are businesses and entrepreneurs, like they're always like, oh, I hate them, mind stuff, stuff. I also want to focus on like changing things and building things and make things better. What I don't understand is that like success comes from your mind, from psychology. In fact, I remember the first two or three funnel hacking live, which is the big event we throw every single year. We basically had speakers come who were just teaching business tactics. After the second or third, when I called Tony Robbins, it's like, Tony, I'd love for you to come speak to my audience. And he's like, sure, I'd love to. He's like, wouldn't we talk about? I said, well, the problem I have is like all these people, like they're so good technically, but they all get stuck. Like they come in during a mastermind group. They join these other programs that are trying to figure out how to get unstuck. And they always looking for like some, some secret marketing tactic or like, give me the marketing secret rustle will change everything for me. And it's rarely ever marketing secrets, almost always something that's like between their ears. It's like something in their brain. And Tony was like, Oh, of course he's like, well, success is 90% psychology only 10% tactics. I was like, really? He's like, yeah, if you look at anything, it's like those who master psychology are the ones who have success, right? And those who aren't, it's because they're not focusing on this. Like number one thing that we focus on is your mind, right? I've seen people who come back and they're struggling in business, like, oh, I'm having problems in my business, but people don't actually have business problems. What you have is you have personal problems that show up in your business. I look at times of my business where I've been struggling and times I've been successful. It's almost always correlated 100% to my own personal mindset, my own psychology. So first set of growth is like, how do we keep our mind sharp? How are we growing? How are we progressing? How are we doing these things inside of our mind? Which is reading, studying, listening to podcasts, like, like all these are going to dump all this information in our brain. So I buy these books and these manuscripts, all these things can try to keep my mindset correct so I can be successful. Step number two then is spirit. For me, it's really about we are creators, right? The prime movers are creating things, creating businesses, you're creating ideas and concepts and all sorts of stuff. And I think what spirit is for me is your connection with your creator. So whoever it is you believe is your creator. Like that's the connection is the spirit. Some of you guys do it through church or some yoga, meditation, through reading, whatever it might be. For me, it's very much my connection with spirit comes through ancient books, scriptures. Like that's how I connect spiritually and through prayer. But we have to be growing spiritually as well. And then number three is we grow through our body. And there's what we eat that has so much to do with. I didn't realize how important this was to me until my wife got pregnant with twins right after I quit wrestling, exercising, everything. And in the next seven and a half, eight months, I was eating with her and I was growing as well. And we ended up both gaining a ton of weight. And then one day, she lost 80 pounds in one day when the babies came out and I didn't. And I was stuck there. And I gained so much weight. I didn't even know how much it was affecting me. It took me eight years eating whatever I wanted, not exercising, whatever I gained so much weight, I was like 230, 240 pounds until eight years later, I decided I needed to finally change. And so I got on a program and started focusing on my body, my nutrition, my eating, my diet. And the craziest thing for me that I did not understand is when I was down to 10% body fat, I was eating the right fuels, I was drinking water, I was taking supplementation, all that kind of stuff, like how much my brain function better, how much my body, I was able to do more work longer, be more clear, all that kind of stuff shifted when I started focusing on my body. I had no idea eight years I wasted, where I could barely even like keep my eyes awake. So I was so tired all the time. The growth side of this of the needs coming back to like folks around growing your mind, your mindset, your spirit in your body. And as you do those things, you get better and better at them, that then transition you over to contribution. The first part of contribution is your purpose. What is your purpose? Like what are you trying to do? What are you trying to accomplish? Like you're here as a prime mover to contribute to society. You change the world. What is your actual purpose? A lot of times I ask people that and they have no idea like I don't even know like what my purpose is. In Japanese culture, there's a thing called the Ikegi. Do I say it right? If not, let me know in the comments. And what it translates to is basically your reason for being. And it's one of my favorite concepts. I would look at this all the time. I show up with my kids and it's just a little diagram chart. I'm going to draw it out so you can kind of see, okay? Here's the first circle and this circle right here is what do you love? Second circle down here is what can you get paid for? Circle over here is what are you good at? The circle over here is what does the world actually need? The intersection between your love and what does the world need? This is your mission. The intersection between what you get paid for and your needs, this is your vocation, okay? The intersection between good and being paid, this is your profession. And then the intersection between what you're good at and what you love is your passion. And right here in the middle where all these things collide, this is what they call your Ikegi. This is your reason for being. And what is the thing you love that the world also needs that you can get paid for that you're really really good at? When you figure out those things in the cross section of those, that's where you figure out your reason for being. Because a lot of times, the things that I love that I'm really good at, I can't get paid for, right? There's things that the world needs I can get paid for but I don't love it, I'm not even good at it, right? It's like figure out the cross section is the key to figure out what your purpose is. So that's step number one is figure out what is your purpose. Second thing then is your message. Okay, inside of your purpose, your reason for being, there is a message that's given to you. Your message to go out there to change people's lives. What is your message? What does that look like? Your message can come in a lot of ways and come in a book, come in a product, come in a course, it can come in a creation, it could come in art, it could come in athletics. But what is your message? What is the thing that you were created to put out there into the world? Right? It's gonna be different for everyone. And the last thing is movement. What prime movers do is they move. They move themselves. They're not sitting here drifting, trying to figure out the needs of their body, right? They are figuring out growth and contribution. They're in motion, they're moving. Also on top of that, it's like how do you get other people to move? How do you create a movement? Okay, it all comes down movements created by marketing, by sales, all things you do to get other people to follow you. Your job as a prime mover is to gather a group of people and to change their lives. And that's how it works. And we get people to move. Number one, by being the example, but being the prime mover in your market, your industry, your community, whatever it is, where you are showing that you're doing things, you have a growth mindset, your focus on your mind, your spirit, your body, you are actually in motion and movement. And then you have a purpose, you got a message and you're pulling people with you through movement, right? Through your marketing, through yourselves, how you get people to move. And so for me, as I was mapping out this whole concept of prime movement, these are the core things, right? They are the people who have moved away if needs the body, the focus on the needs of the spirit, focusing on growth and contribution. They grow three ways, mind, spirit and body. And they contribute through the purpose, being very clear on what their purpose is by finding their message and then creating movement both in themselves and the people they even call the serve. And so that's what prime movers are. And that's why I think that this concept is really cool. And it all came initially from outwitting the devil when I first read this talking about the difference between drifters and driven. Napoleon is correct and the devil in his analogy is correct. Like 90% of the world are drifting. It's only 2% that are having success. People are saying, oh, it's so hard to have success. Like, is it really? Like, you're not competing against everybody. Yeah, there's about 7-8 billion people on the planet. You're not competing against all of those. And in your market, like in whatever it is, like it's very, very small. Like even look at the market that I'm in, right? The how to make money on the internet, like how do business grow? Like, it's a big market and it's probably, I don't know, 100 people successfully in that market. So I'm only competing against 100 people out of billions and billions of people, right? It's crazy to start thinking about it. Like, if you are just willing to step up and to take on the calling and to go out there and do the thing and have a purpose, have a message and put the marketing out there, like, you're not competing against everybody. You have 98% of the people that you are then calling to go in there and help set an example, right? Show them about growth, show them about contribution, get them to step up and to follow you and transform them into prime movers as well. So that's some of the concepts. Again, I'm still playing with this concept of prime mover right now. It's just my favorite thing to think about and talk about because you are the people I've been called the serve, people who are driven, who are trying to change the world. And we do that through a lot of ways. We help people through personal development, through our company's secrets to success, right? We help them through like finding their voice, creating their messages through the marketing secrets company. We help them build sales forms, they convert and get people into movements through ClickFalse, our software company. So everything we do is all focused on like helping the prime movers be able to actually change the world. And so if you are a prime mover, I want you to step up, to take the flag, put it into the ground and say, yes, I'm a prime mover. These are the people whose lives I've been called to change. I'm going to be focusing my life on growth and contribution, how do I do these things to a level where I can change the world. And if you're stuck in the spot right now, I know that I'm a drifter. I know that I'm not doing things like I could be or I should be. So many people I could be helping me. I'm stuck in this in this hypnotic rhythm like the Pauli Hill calls it. Understand like that's the first step, right? Is to come through and figure out, okay, how do I get the needs of my body met? How do I figure out how to have certainty in my life in a positive way, not a negative way? Because you can get certainty by doing drugs every day, knowing the feeling you're going to get or you get certainty by like waking up early morning, having good routine, having things like that. Like there's a positive negative for all these, right? Number two, how do I get variety in my life where I can be excited? How do I create experiences for myself, for my family, to create a variety of excitement? How do I have fine significance in my calling, in my mission, in my relationships, right? And how do I find love and connection? When you find those four things, you get those needs met, it gets easy to step into your calling as a prime mover. So hope this video is useful for you. If it is and if you have decided you want to be a prime mover, you want to stop drifting and start becoming someone who's driven, let us know in the comments down below. I'm excited to see what movements you want to create and see whose people's lives you've been called to change. Thanks so much and I hope you enjoy this video.
