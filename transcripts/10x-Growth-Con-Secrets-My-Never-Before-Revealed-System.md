If you have the perfect pitch once and you do it once you get paid once Now there's a dude running around this planet right now. He did three million dollars In one and a half hours three million dollars in sales and one and a half I have to stop you talking about I don't understand I think I gotta get it. I bought it for her.

Come here man This dude right here Well, I'm just gonna spend a few minutes He asked if I would come in just come back down and tell you guys a little about what we did first off Who are here invested real quick?

We just saw the greatest sales thing that we ever seen how did you do that as I said my team were processing orders I was like you would be really cool to do for this group How many guys would like to learn how to sell the way that I did yesterday? All right about half you guys the other half you want to make three million bucks in an hour and a half How many as well let us sell the way I did yesterday Okay, so the way that I sold yesterday the way that I sell when I do it. It's not something I just made up overnight About 12 years ago. I went to an event kind of like this And I was a shy awkward nerdy kid who sat in the back of the room awkwardly taking notes listening to all these amazing speakers I remember the very first time I saw a table rush I saw a bunch of people jump up and run the back of the room I was doing math with two four six eight ten I was like that dude just made $80,000 in an hour and that's the next I get up and he sold a five thousand dollar package I'm doing the math and I got like a hundred fifty thousand dollars an hour And I was like I'm a very shy introverted person I didn't necessarily want to get on stages, but I was like I have to learn that skill set if somebody can make a hundred fifty thousand Dollars an hour so I'm gonna make three million dollars an hour Whatever it costs, whatever it takes I have to learn that skill set So I spent the next 12 years of my life mastering that I spent three years on the road every single weekend going to vent after vent after event speaking selling practicing learning networking with the speakers to have them crafting my my presentation I spent over a million dollars having coaches take me and tweak my presentation tweak it tweak it tweak it until I got really good And then after that my three years on the road I started doing online because I didn't want to leave my wife my kids And we've done webinars and webinars and tell us seminars and whole bunch of things What you guys say yes It's kind of the the culmination of that what if I do a special one-day training and I'll walk through like what I did on this slide Why did I do that walk you second by second minute by minute through the entire 90 minute presentation?
