What's up? Here's what's happening. We're going to the side to get cleaned up and then we're heading over to the cigar bar. We're coming back, waking up at 6.30, jumping into the plane, going to Joel's and then doing the podcast thing there. And you're back in the plane and going back to your house and then our house. 24 hours. The goal is to get everybody here to promote the Traffic Seekers book, hopefully. So we got a couple copies right here, John's got. Perfect. Whoa. Perfect. What don't? I want it. So is there videos, evidence of this? Russell throwing me down and breaking my neck. I don't have it. No, it never will ever see it. I came to Florida to hang out with the chef for a couple of times, but I filmed the infomercial here. Really? Yeah. What was it? You haven't seen the infomercial? I remember that. It's real bad. The only infomercial I ever did. It was horrible. Have you ever dreamed of working from home but didn't know how to get started? Are you finally ready to be truly taught for the first time in your life by a true internet millionaire? If you've answered yes to any of these questions, the next few minutes can literally change your life. Oh, you didn't see it? Yeah, nobody did. So Rich Sheffrin, one of the OGs in our space. The fact that I was first to learn in this game was he recently sold his company to Agora. Now him and Agora are working together on a big project where they're doing an internet marketing newsletter. It's kind of cool. And hopefully we can talk about ClickFunnels on these letters. What are the three surprises that stood out of all the surprises? As far as things that you just never knew you were going to be on your plate? Are there things like that? I think the biggest one was actually, do you remember when we spoke in London? Yeah. A year into ClickFunnels. I don't know if you remember this, but we were flying over the ocean and you have no cell phone access where you're flying. We land in London. My wife, my kids are all with me and I get my phone hooked back up to the internet. And I have hundreds, maybe thousands of messages coming in from people who loved me when I left and were death-threatening, wanting to kill me afterwards. And I'm like, what's happening? And I messaged Todd, he's my co-founder, and he's like, ClickFunnels is down and we can't figure out what's happening. Oh, jeez. And I was just like, oh my gosh, this is the year into it. And I remember he said something on the phone. He said, if we're able to get software back up, and I heard it was the word if. And I was like, I'm supposed to be speaking tomorrow in an event, talking about, I'm just freaking out. And I remember going to the hotel that night with my wife and my kids, everyone's tired. I kind of put in another room and I was like, this is my first time at leadership where I was just like, I don't know what to do. Like, do I hide? Do I come out and say something? What do I do? And decided like, I'm just going to do a Facebook Live to our community. And I'm not going to be like, try to hide behind it. Like, I'm going to show them how pissed I am and how it's just not okay. And we did a Facebook Live from the hotel room. And I just came out and I was just like, this is unacceptable. It's not okay what's happening. Like, I'm upset. You should be upset. Like, I get it. I apologize for trying to figure this out. We ended being down about eight hours before we got things back up. And I assumed that like, that was the end of the business. People are going to walk away. And every morning I get an email with like the sales numbers and like cancellations to kind of see what's happening. And there was literally like no dip in cancellations during that time. And I was like, oh my gosh, like, I realized that like people and your customers are on your side. As long as you're not trying to hide stuff from them, right? The more you come out and like, this is what's happening. This is why it's happening. I think that was one of the big, the big lessons early on that I just like, There's more than two things I greatly admire about you. But these two things I question, right? Not like, I just, I wonder how you do it. The one thing is, I think you have this magical gift to simplify. Right? Like if I would have wrote dot com secrets, it would have been double the length. See, and I think you've done that in all your presentations too. You just have this way of simplifying stuff. And then the other thing was, is that I also think, and you know this story, But like you just have mastery of like creating an offer, best strategy and simplification or offer creation. Okay, I'll start with the first question because it actually ties back in. It is like literally simplification of our sales process. Because again, I'm the creative likes to create funnels like that's, Which is a pro in the con is like, we have really good funnels. The con is like, we've got too many funnels. And I remember last year, John, who runs our traffic sitting here in front of us, I asked him, I was like, in a perfect world, how many funnels per year would you like for me? Like I can pump out, you know, one a week, one a day, like let me know. And he looked at me, he's like, two. I'm like, two like a week or how often say, you know, two this year would be all that we need. And I'm like, wait, what? You know, like broke me. I'm like, what do you mean? He's like, we can't optimize all the traffic to 40 different funnels. He's like, do you give us two? And then you focus instead of making 40 funnels, make 400 ads for each funnel. He's like, that'll grow clip phones faster than anything else. And so for me, it was like coming back and looking at our pallet of offers and stuff and be like, I got to kill some babies because it's complex, too complex for the company. And then my mind shares and like all these different things. And so we're literally coming and shutting things off to like, here's the focal point. And then my job instead of making funnels is what's the creative we can make. Yeah, that makes total sense. To put people in and so, but I think it depends a lot on the business. I think traditionally it's funny because we talk a lot about a value lab, like having a book funnel at least a webinar to high ticket. But like typically like in the middle is the best place to start because it's easier to make profit on ads. Right. If you're selling a thousand dollar product, it's way easier than if you got a free plus shipping product. We got to have this funnel just optimize like crazy to get it to break even so you can sell the next thing. So I think it's figuring out what's the thing that's going to be the most money up front and focusing on that. That helps you scale better because you're bringing in money. And then where you leave the list, like catch up for two minutes. It's interesting because like when we all got started back in the day, it was really hard. There was no like, I don't even remember how we drove traffic back in the day. There wasn't Facebook or Instagram. And then some of these tools came out and became easier. In fact, I just finished my third book called Traffic Secrets. And one of the first chapters is called There's a Storm Coming. And I think that the internet has been really easy for the last decade. And I think it's going to get harder. I think, you know, we saw 10, 15 years ago, Google with the Google Slaps and all the things that happened. I think the same things are happening on social. I'm seeing some people losing their Facebook accounts and things like that. So I think it's definitely getting in the storms coming. And it's really the people who understand the fundamentals of business are the ones who are going to stick past it. People that know how to run a Facebook ad and sell offer. That's the easy stuff. And that's in the season right now, but winter's coming, storms are coming. Things are changing. And it's like the people that actually understand the fundamentals are going to be ones that survive and thrive throughout it. I think there's going to be a lot of people who are going to get caught and not understand the strategies. If they're not, they're not preparing themselves now. You've really created a media company around you and what ClickFunnels does to really, I see it as it's building trust in the marketplace. They continuously see you and promoting your students and like as opposed to the fly by night of our world, sources becoming super important. Where we get our information from. How do you think about where even you get your information from? I think the question, I think for me a lot of where, you know, I tell people all the time that like the best way to see what's actually working is like, like try to fill the pulse of the market, like what's actually happening. So for me, for example, I go into Facebook and Instagram and I unsubscribe from all of my friends. I subscribe to people who I think are doing well and I start watching what they're doing, right? I'm not watching what they're saying. I'm watching what they're doing. What are they posting? And then from the things they're posting, what's getting comments, what's getting shares, what's not like, what's what's happening? And then I'll go through the funnel, actually buy the product and see how I try to notice how I felt. So I think for me, it's a lot of just like is listening differently, you know, trying to try to fill the pulse of the market by really paying attention. What's what's happening because it's shifting so much. And I think I don't think anyone really knows a lot of the times. Everyone's trying a lot of things. I think the biggest thing we can do is be watching and observing and then looking at the patterns and see what's working and then modeling those things, but not copying. Like modeling them as like a core idea, but then always trying to innovate on it. You know, I think one of the biggest problems is most of the people in their marketing are all copycats, right? So someone comes up with an idea and they see it. Oh, and it's this pattern interrupt that like, they're like all since working because it's like the pattern interrupt and everyone's like, oh, that thing worked. And then like, they start copying copying. Soon as like the pattern interrupt becomes the pattern and it stops working. Nowadays, man, it's like we have to shift creative every, every week with new ads, new things hitting because they'll work. They become the pattern interrupt. They're working for a while. And then obviously all my communities seem what we're doing. And they're like, they're copying as fast as we're pumping stuff out. So we're always. And so what I do to try to figure it out is I look at other industries besides my own, right? Like what's happening in the fitness industry and in the this industry? And we look at all over the place and try to like just get ideas from everywhere, not just from our market because there's people innovating different places. Like I still remember the very first hand sketch video that came out. It was my Geary with the Truth About Apps. He did this thing and I saw that over there because I was following all the fitness guys and I saw it. I was like, oh my gosh. And I found the guy who did it, hired him. He did the first, our first one. We were the first to mark the hand doodle ad and it worked so good for so long because no one knew who it was. And then probably six months later, people found out and they all started doing it and then it became the pattern and stopped working, right? Meme videos were the same way. We had a bunch of clients in the weight loss space that were doing meme videos. They were crushing it. Nobody was doing it in our world. So we're like, okay, so we started meme videos and like they were just crushing it. Like we're like, I hope nobody sees this, but eventually everyone sees it and then now your whole feed's full though. So it's like, it's looking for other inspiration outside of just your market. Like what's what are ideas that we can try and we can test? And then you've got a window where you can become the pattern interrupts until it becomes the pattern. But that's the game of marketing. It's always constant innovation and it's fun. And you know, I think back in the day, people had to innovate once every, you know, a couple of years. Now we got to do it a couple of times a week. So it makes it fun.
