Alright, Sonora, who is your favorite artist? Tay-Tay. Tay-Tay? Who's that? Taylor Swift. Not only does my daughter love her, but apparently 53% of American adults consider themselves to be Taylor Swift fans. Yeah, Swifties. Now, despite the fact that some people think there's nothing actually that special about her, I don't think that. I think she's fantastic. But the question for this video is why is she so successful? What is she doing that most people can't actually see? So during this video, I'm going to peel back behind the curtains and share three secrets behind what Tay-Tay is doing to build a billion-dollar empire and how you can adopt these tactics to propel your business forward over the next year. And then also stick around until the end because I'm going to show you how Taylor Swift, master one rule, keeps her fans coming back for more, probably more than anything else she's doing. Now one caveat before we start is that no one is going to market your business better than you are. You have to understand that so Taylor's not outsourcing her marketing to somebody else. She's controlled everything she's doing inside her business because she knows her customer is better than anyone else. I'm really in touch with my fans and I know what they like. As you probably know, she was in a red ocean just like every other musician on the planet, but she created her very own blue ocean. That's why she's so spectacular. Okay, so strategy number one is that she didn't just go and start selling music. She actually created a movement, right? And she was the guide in this movement, taking people with her on her journey. So I'm going to share three strategies that Taylor Swift is currently using right now to build her movement and her brand. And selfishly, I want you to know that all three of these strategies are directly from my book, Expert Secrets. If you don't have a chance to read this, I'll put a link down below. This is a book about how you can create a movement of people who are excited to buy from you over and over and over again. So Taylor does this better than almost anybody. One of the things we talk about when we're building a movement is you have to have a backstory, right? Taylor's done a great job at sharing her backstory, not just like the highlight reel, but the things that were struggling. She really did get a lot of teasing and a lot of ridicule. The very first songs that she wrote were about those things. Because I felt alone, I would sit in my room and write the songs that would get me a ticket, somewhere else. So in the face of adversity, she became successful through that. She shares that story with her fans. He gives them hope and faith that they can do something as well. The next principle she uses is she talks to her people in parables and she shares character flaws, right? And so she tells stories all the time, but she also doesn't just tell the stories and make her look great, right? She talks about her character flaws. She talks about how she struggles with insecurities and she has pressure to fit in. You are so fake. Talks about the highs and lows in her relationships. In fact, most of her songs are about her relationships and the struggles she's having. She also talks about how she struggles with public scrutiny, navigating her love life. Her openness about her imperfections and the lessons she's learned from them helps endear her fans to her and makes her seem more relatable and genuine to them as well. My experience has been that my mistakes led to the best things in my life. The next principle is polarity. If you're trying to please everybody, you can't please anybody. And so she has a great job of using polarity inside of her songs, her music, her marketing, all her messaging. In fact, one of the cool stories that she shares a lot that shows this polarity is her battling against the music industry, right? After I was denied the chance to purchase my music outright, my entire catalog was sold to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. She stood up against huge corporate giants and people who actually had bought the rights for songs and sold them to other people and she was able to fight against that and actually republish songs which is unheard of and super cool and gangster. There is no career path that comes free of negativity. If you're being met with resistance, that probably means that you're doing something new. All right, let's move on now to strategy number two, which is creating irresistible offers that help to elevate the status of the person who's buying into what you are doing. Everything in sales has to do with increasing the status of your customer, right? The perceived status that they have. One thing that she's done so great is that she does this by elevating the perceived status of her fans. During her 1989 tour, she personally selected fans from her social media to actually come and attend private events. I held these parties in my houses, in my living rooms and I invited 89 fans to each one and I played the entire album early for people. She made them feel influential and valued and again made people more tied and more bought into the whole entire Taylor Swift experience. She also increased their wealth by creating her very own like rewards type program. She called Swift Ticks during their reputation tour. She had a really cool point system where you can get Taylor Swift Ticks to help build that community and the fan base even stronger. Additionally, she's released limited edition merchandise collections, autographed memorabilia, exclusive fashion pieces, providing fans with a sense of exclusivity and elevated status through ownership of rare collectibles. All these things she's done to help build a tribe of people who will follow her to every concert. All right, now strategy number three is she's exploiting what I call inside expert secrets, the value ladder. And this is one of my favorite principles from both my dot com secrets and my expert secrets book and she uses them flawlessly. Think about this, you can listen to Taylor songs for free on the radio. From there, she pushes you to buy her albums. From there, she has her movie, which is a video version of her tour. People can come to anyone in the world and go watch her movies. From there, you should want to actually come to her live tour. And so it doesn't matter where you are in her ecosystem, she's always taking you where you are and moving you and progressing through her value ladder to eventually hopefully get a percentage of people to come to her high exclusive events. Now, one last thing I want to share, Taylor mastered one rule that keeps her fans coming back for more. In fact, it is the number one rule of selling and that is the reciprocity is king. In 2020, she actually gave out stimulus checks to her fans and she gave six figure bonuses to her truck drivers on her tours. She even pulled her music from Spotify because they weren't giving enough money to the actual artist. I think that there has to be a way for streaming or any future ways that we access music to fairly compensate the writers, musicians and producers of that music. In fact, because of that, Spotify completely restructured the payment to artists because of her. These acts of service that she did for her fans, the people to work for, for other artists, increased the reciprocity and the bond that people had with her, keeping them engaged and loyal. A lot of times, you know, you read a book like Expert Secrets, you see, oh, this is how it works for someone who's a coach or for a consultant, but it literally works for any business, including someone who is literally the biggest star on the planet today. So for you, it doesn't really matter what kind of business you're in, it's figuring out how can I use those things inside of my business and my life as well. So with that said, I hope you guys enjoyed this video.
