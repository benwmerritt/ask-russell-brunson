## Transcript
I met a guy at one of my jobs that was doing a lot of affiliate marketing. He would just promote these other products and get paid just for promoting the product. He didn't have to have his own product or anything. And in my head, an entrepreneur was somebody that invented something like they created a software, they created a product. And once he did that, a light came out of my head like, I can just promote products. And he's like, I don't charge anybody money. I just give them free value, you know, and they love me for it and I still get paid. And that is awesome. I'm like, you don't ever have to charge money to people. You can still make money. When I got connected with ClickFunnels, it was just so natural. Like, oh, this is the cool, awesome product that I can promote and get paid to promote. I don't have to invent things. I don't have to set up customer support teams or anything. I just need to promote this product and I can make my full-time income off that. The first month, I'm fairly certain I got no affiliate signed up. Kept pushing that ClickFunnels gives training. There's lots of trainings. There's a Facebook group with tons of people out there that help you. I'm pretty sure on the second month, I had three to five people signed up. And after that, you know, I just slowly started to pick up and it's so cool to see that dream car start, you know, going faster and faster. And I can remember breaking the 50 mark, probably six months in and I'm like, I'm halfway to, you know, the car of my dreams. There's four under that I've been waiting for. And after 50, you know, you're just so motivated and it really starts to go fast because you're learning different things and you're trying different things. And as things start to work more and more and you start to get more and more excited, you know, you stay up till 2am doing it because you're so excited. And a year later, I just got a call and I'm the number one ClickFunnels affiliate. And it's like, that's me, you know, in a year. So me and my wife are actually two days away from heading to Hawaii and we're able to go to Hawaii and not worry at all financially. I don't have to tell a boss that, you know, I take those two weeks off. As my daughter grows up, I know I can be your soccer coach. I can attend her soccer games. I can go camping on weekdays, go see movies at three o'clock any day I want. You know, there's just so much that I can do now and so much available to me now that I have this income coming in that's a passive income and no longer tied to, you know, how many hours I put into the job. I've had a dream car three or four years now before I knew about ClickFunnels Dream Car Contest and it's a Toyota 4Runner but really, really beefed up for, you know, for going out and then using it the way SUVs are meant to be used for. We take it up, we live right up in the mountains. We can take it up in the mountains all over. You know, that car is able to help me live the lifestyle that I want to live. If you're like me and you're just getting started like I was a year ago and you don't have a product and you really don't want to, you know, you don't want to develop a product, that's fine because ClickFunnels has developed an awesome product that you can promote and you can feel good promoting and a year later I'm here, you know, with my full-time income coming without a single product that I own or anything. I just have to promote a product that's already there and is already awesome and is used by thousands and thousands of successful people every single day.
