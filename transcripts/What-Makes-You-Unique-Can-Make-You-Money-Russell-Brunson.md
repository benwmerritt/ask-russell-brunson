## Transcript
I want to talk about the thing that you have that actually makes you unique. The thing that actually is the thing that people will pay you for inside of your business. And most people miss this. They think that someone's buying a product or a service or something, but what they don't understand is the thing that somebody's actually buying from you is the result. That's all they really want. They don't care about you or your story or anything else. They don't care about your product or your service. They just want the result. There's an old marketing adage that says, you know, someone is trying to buy a drill. They don't really want a drill, right? Or a hammer. They're looking for a hole in the wall. Like, that's what they actually want. And the question for you is like, what do your customers actually want? And the thing they actually want is just a result. Okay? Now, what most people understand when you start looking at business that way, say, okay, what is the result that my dream client is trying to get? Then you can step back and start reverse engineering. Okay, well, how do I get someone that result? And the thing that most people understand is that to get any kind of result, all you need is a recipe or I like to call a framework. You know, what's the recipe? Let's say I want to build a cake. All you got to do is to grab a recipe and say, okay, you got to put in two scoops of flour, three eggs, some sugar and you mix it all up, put it in the oven for X amount of time and boom, it pops out of cake, right? And it's a simple replicable process you can do over and over and over again, right? Now, for you to be successful with your clients, you need the exact same thing. You need a recipe or a framework that gets them the result they're looking for. Okay? Now, what most people understand is that the thing you have that is the most valuable, the thing that people are going to pay you for is that framework, is that recipe. I always talk about this. Like, you think about the result you're trying to get for a client. Now, think about yourself before you got that result. Okay? It might have been five years ago, ten years ago, when you first went on the journey, you were trying to figure out how in the world do I accomplish this thing, right? I want to lose weight. I want to make money. I want to trade the stock market. I want whatever your result is, right? You had this result and for a period of time, you were trying to figure out how to do it. You probably tried a dozen different ways to try to get that result and this one didn't work and that one didn't work. You tried a bunch of things. So, eventually, you figured out a process and a path to get the result you're looking for, right? Now, the fact that you've actually gotten that result now gives you the most valuable thing in the world, which is this map. It's a framework. It's a recipe that takes somebody from where they are today to get that result and that's the thing people are actually paying you for. Like I said, I call this a framework. Now, I wanted to show with you guys a really cool presentation. As you probably know, I'm in the middle of our biggest event, our big annual event every year called Funnel Hacking Live. We have this year over 10,000 people from around the world coming to watch it and attend it and so I don't have a ton of time to make a brand new video for you guys today. So, that would be really cool is that Funnel Hacking Live last year, I did a really special presentation teaching you how to create a framework. Okay? So, most of you guys have a result. You know how to get results for other people, but you don't know how to create a framework and you don't know how to teach the framework in a way that gets people to move, to buy it from you, to actually change their life. And so, I'm going to share with you guys this really cool presentation from Funnel Hacking Live. Now, again, people who actually saw this presentation, they had to buy $1,000 for a ticket, they had to get flights and hotels to come out to actually attend the event and I want to give it to you guys for free as a gift because if you can understand how to develop and create your own frameworks, it will change everything for you. The frameworks are the answer. And so, that said, watch this presentation for Funnel Hacking Live teaching you how to develop your own frameworks. I've been so excited about this. This is going to help preframe the rest of the week and I think that it'll make you guys start shifting away, you look at things a little bit. I shared this a little bit on the Two Comic Club Cruise. Who are the people who are on my cruise with me? Okay, we did a midnight mastermind session because that's what we do on cruises. We step online, I talked about this a little bit and I've kind of evolved it and developed it a little bit and I want to talk to you guys about today because I think it's a piece that's going to help you guys understand how to have more success with your funnels. And it's going to seem counterintuitive at first, but I promise if you stick with me and sit through the process, you'll be like, oh my gosh, I see how this is in everything that we do. And so, I'll give you guys a handout today. It's called Expert Evolution, How to Become the Leader that Your Tribe has Been Waiting For. You can take notes on that as we're going through there if you want. But I'm going to be covering three different frameworks right now. The first is the framework on how to find your voice. The second is the framework on how to teach frameworks. And number three is the framework on how to sell your frameworks. So that's the game plan for the next hour and six minutes and 56 seconds. Ken, so this is the blueprint. This is the framework right here of how to find your voice. I think a lot of us get started in this business. At least I did. And I was a shy, awkward, and I'm going to show you guys a clip here in a minute. You have to evolve. You can't just... There's a process you go through. And a lot of times people will read my book, Expert Secrets, the next day they're out there with a sign saying, I'm an expert. I'm going to sell you something. It's like, you missed it. That's not the purpose. It's not the path. It's not how it works. There's a process for you to be able to find your voice and be like, what's the process was it look like? And forever I didn't know. I said, you just go out there and you do it and you do it and you do it. It wasn't until recently I sat down and said, what did it actually look like for me? What did it look like for other people? Like, how do I reverse engineer that so we can teach it? And that's where this process and this framework came from. All right. So I'm going to walk you through this. So phase number one here. Phase number one is what I call the dreamer. And this is the phase that starts with a little spark. Okay. How many of you guys when you got into whatever it is that you're doing, you didn't know exactly what you were going to do. You may not have been super passionate at first, but you had interest and desire. This is kind of cool. Okay. And think about your business or the marketing of your business. Like when I got started in this, I didn't know it was going to be a marketing nerd. I got to see in my marketing class. Okay. A scene I should have gotten a D or an F and my teacher was really, really nice. But I got to see my marketing. I didn't know marketing was even exciting or fun or anything. Okay. It wasn't until later when I was learning these things and trying to start a business and all of a sudden like there was this spark. I was like, oh my gosh, this is, this is amazing. And it all begins there. Okay. So when you think about your business, like what was the spark initially that got you so excited about what it is you do? Can you guys remember that moment? What was the create that spark for you? Okay. That's where this begins. Okay. The next thing that I want to kind of add upon that, this is from Tom Bill. You and Tom is speaking tomorrow, I believe. So I'm excited about Tom coming or his first time in Funalaki Live. But I was developing this. I saw Tom post something on Instagram and I was like, oh my gosh, this is, this is brilliant. He posted a little framework for how to develop your own passion. And I think about this a lot because I get people all the time who come into our world who are like, this is exciting, but I'm not, I'm not passionate about anything yet. Russell. I'm not going to find passion. I'm like, I don't know because for me, I'm just excited about everything in life. Like there's so many cool things happening. I was like, I don't know how to develop passion. Like, I don't, like how, like, I couldn't like understand that in my mind until I saw this from Tom and I was like, oh my gosh, this is the secret. For those of you guys who may not have it, you've got a spark and you're trying to figure things out, this will help you. So this is what he said. This is the five step process. He said, number one is you go and experiment the whole bunch of stuff. Okay. So if you don't know, like, I don't, I don't know what business I want to be in. I don't know what my career is going to be or whatever. Like you go try a bunch of things. That's why a lot of people go to college, right? You're taking a whole bunch of classes just to find out what am I actually interested in. Right? So you go and experiment the whole bunch of stuff. That's step number one. Step number two is after you do that, you start looking at all the things I just tested and tried all the things I read, all the podcasts I listened to, all the videos I watched, like what are the things that sparked my interest? Okay. You think, okay, I'm interested in that. That's the next topic I'm excited about. Like that's something I can be passionate about. Okay. So you find the thing that sparks your interest from there. You start deeply engaging with those things that sparked your interest. You start going deeper on them. Okay. So you listen to podcasts about biohacking or about whatever and you're like, this is cool. And they say, okay, now let's go deeper. Let's see if I go deeper if this keeps resonating with me. You start going deeper, start studying, start learning, start finding people around you as excited as well and go as deep as you can. Okay. Number four, as you start engaging, if it goes from an interest to true fascination, okay, and you get that fascination like, oh my gosh, this is exciting, then you go down the path of gaining mastery. And then number five, fascination plus mastery equals passion. Okay. So this for sure was true in my journey. Again, I got started. I was a college kid. I just met my beautiful wife. I proposed to her and then I realized that I didn't have a job and she was probably going to want to eat sometimes. And I was like, what do I do? I don't know. Let me try a whole bunch of stuff. I started doing a whole bunch of things and studying and reading and learning. And like, also I started finding these things that cause interest and those things that started geeking out on it started going deeper and deeper until that interest became a passion. And the more I deep, the more fascinating I got and the more fun it got. And that's where this journey begins. That's how you get the spark and you start to grow. Okay. All right. So after you just have a spark, do you know the best way to turn the spark into a fire? You just want to see? It's just kind of cool. So this is the way you turn the spark into fire. Let's dim the lights a little bit. If I get my phone out right here, I turn the slide on. Let's see. Okay. This is a spark. And by itself, I'm not careful. The spark is going to go out, right? Okay. I need your guys help. Can everyone get their phones out real quick and turn the lights on? So the interesting happens when you take a spark and you get it around other people's sparks, other people who are already on fire. So you grab your phones out and get them out, turn your camera on really quick. I want you guys to see this. If I want to turn my spark into a fire to an inferno, I got to find other people. Look around you guys. Look behind you. You find other people and you get your sparks together. It starts growing. If I take my spark to a fire, it can't help but grow. Am I right? That's why we're here today, to help you guys take your spark and to light it on fire. I tell people all the time, like my role in this whole game is to get you guys so excited and so passionate about the marketing of your business, whatever business you're in, you build a run with it. I'm assuming you're already obsessed with your business or you wouldn't be here. So my job is to get you obsessed with the marketing of it. Let me take that spark and ignite it and get it on fire. So the best way to turn that spark into a fire is to ignite it. I lost my thing. It's to get around other people. As you get around other people, you start feeling that it starts growing inside of you, that shifts you now to the second phase. The second phase is where I start taking on the identity of the reporter. It's interesting. How many of you guys have ever heard of Howard Berg, the world's fastest reader? When I was in elementary school in the 90s, I was an infomercial geek. So I was watching infomercials and there was this guy who is the world's fastest reader. I saw him reading these books and he goes through the page like this and flips through and starts reading them super fast. I was like, that is the coolest thing. I'm like, there's no way it's true. He's got to be faking it. I remember watching the infomercials over and over and over again as a kid. Then fast forward like 15 years later, I'm a grown man or grown-ish. My kids always tell me, like, Dad, you are the least mature adult we have ever met. I'm like, thank you guys, I think. I remember on Fox News on the, what's the Kavuto, the Kavuto show, Howard Berg was on there. It was right after the healthcare bill came out and there's the huge healthcare bill and then Howard Berg read the entire healthcare bill live on Fox News from everybody. So he reads the whole healthcare bill in 55 minutes, I believe. And then afterwards he interviews Mike. So what did it say? And he starts telling them all the things and reciting back huge portions of the healthcare bill. I'm like, this guy is amazing. Then I'm at an event like this. In Dallas, it was about a thousand people. It's about a fifth the size of this. And I'm speaking on stage. I get done afterwards with some guys like, hey, there's the world's fastest readers here. He wants to meet you. I was like, wait, wait. Howard Berg's here. And I started like totally fangirling and freaking out. He's like, you know who he is? I'm like, yeah. I used to watch his infomercials when I was like 15 years old. Like this is anyway, so excited. I had a chance to meet him and me and power become really good friends since then. And actually when I launched the expert secrets book, I had Howard flower to our office. I was like, I want, I want you to read the entire, my entire book live on Facebook. And then I want to quiz you and see if you can actually remember it. Cause like writing a book is cool, but having the world's fastest reader read it live in front of you is like way cooler than. So I had Howard and flew out to boys. I was like, here's the book. I want you to read it. And he sat down and started reading it. And did you see the episode of this? We did it on Falakir TV. He read the entire book in four minutes and 43 seconds live on Facebook. And I was like, this is so cool. I'm like, there's no way he's actually getting it. So I watched him read the whole thing. And then we got done reading it. I had the really cool opportunity to sit there like, okay, let's see if you actually read it. And I started asking questions about it. And he was able to tell me things back. I said, well, you said this and you said this. And then you talked about this and this is my thought about that. And it was one of the coolest experiences of my life. But what was he? Do you guys ever see the Sony speed reader commercial? He's on that with Justin Timberlake. It's a really funny ad where basically they had a Sony speed reader and Justin Timberlake said something like, or maybe it was Peyton Manning. Anyway, Peyton Manning said something like, with a Sony reader, I could read a hundred books. And Howard Burgos, I just did. And then Justin Timberlake's like, I just did too. It's the funniest commercial. Anyway, it's worth watching. So I had that night after we got done, took Howard out to dinner in Boise. And I'm sitting here, I'm like, this is a guy who's read over 30,000 books. Every book you can dream of, he's read. What do you ask this guy? He's got information about everything. I'm like, I could ask him about business or about finance or about sports or anything. And I was like, I'm going to go to a spot that you don't normally go with people because I'm really, really curious. And so I asked him, I said, Howard, I'm really curious. After all your life experience, you're reading 30,000 books. Like what's your opinion on God? He looked at me from any smile. He said, you know what's interesting? He said most people, when they want to learn about a topic, they'll read one book or one thing and they base their opinions on that, becomes fact for them and they go forward. He said, what I like to do in stays, like I like to read all the people's opinions. So he's like, I'll read 10, 15, 20 books about a topic. For example, so for religious, like I read, he's like, I basically read every single book on the topic. As many as I possibly could, like hundreds and hundreds of books. He said by reading a whole bunch of things about it, he said, I got a very holistic view of what I believe God is. He said, based on that, let me tell you what I believe. I had one of the most fascinating conversations in my life to hear what someone like this is a chance to learn and read from every religion you can dream of what his beliefs were in God. One of the most coolest, most amazing conversations in my life. So I was thinking about this with Howard. I started thinking about how that works in our life. A lot of times we come into this world and we're trying to do our business and we're like, we become the expert. Like I know everything and then we go out there and we try to convince people. So the problem is we read one book and I was like, the phase for you to really evolve and to find your voice isn't to like take one idea and then start running with it is to get a very holistic view. So I started looking back at like when I got started and I found something really embarrassing. This right here is the first video I ever created ever. This is, last year I showed you guys one and you all tease me. This one's worse. So this is about time YouTube came out and a couple of people had videos on their websites and I was like, I'm going to do a video. And I remember someone, Armand Moore had a video and he had the background was like, was gone and he was like on the page and looks really cool. So I'm like, I'm going to do that. So I bought a video camera. I set it up and I record this video and it didn't work. I tried to edit it. I couldn't get the background to delete and like it was so many bad things. But this was the very first video I ever made. And I want you guys to hear how bad I was and hopefully also give some of you guys some encouragement. You're like, if that guy can do it. Okay. I'm Russell Brunson. Welcome to the second tier. I'm here to help you get in. Okay. Hi, I'm Russell Brunson. Welcome to the second tier. I'm here to introduce you. Would you say hi? I'm Russell Brunson. Welcome to the second tier. I want to help you get started with your affiliate training today. The first thing you need to do is click on the link above me and download our affiliate. That was real cool. The flushing toilet in the background. He literally flushed it in the middle of the video. It was me and him. There were two of us in the room. Like, well, come on. Anyway, so there's hope for all of you. I swear. So this is the beginning of my journey. And I was like, I'm horrible, but I'm going to try. I started trying. Now at this point in time, I had one, I like, I had like my beliefs like, okay, this is how I'm going to do this thing. But I didn't know Mark, I didn't know these things. I'm like, how do I, how do I learn this? And so what I did is I went out there, I said, okay, I'm going to do it. How would Berk would have done? I was going to take my opinion and believe everything. I'm going to go and find a whole bunch of people who know more than me. I'm going to talk to them, interview them, figure out all their stuff. And based on, on finding out opinions from a whole bunch of people from there, I can develop an actual opinion. So this little nerdy Russell from 15 years ago went out there and he found the best of the best of the time. This is Carl Gulletti. I used to call him all the time and ask him questions. This is Mike Philson. This is Gary Ambrose. This is Brad Callan. I think it's in the room. This is Brad Fallon. This is Ewan Chia. This is Rosalind Gardner. This is Jack Humphries. This is Keith Baxter. These are the people when I got started in the game. They were the people that were already on fire. I had a little flame. I was like, I have a flame. This thing's going to go out and find somebody fast. I started looking, who's got the fire? Who's got the fire? I need to find those people. And I found the fire. I got on the phone. I called them. I flew to the house. I had them find in my house. I did everything I could. I got in the rooms they were in. Because I knew that if I wasn't taking my spark and I needed to become a fire, I had to be with the people who were already on fire. I found those people and this little nerdy Rosal was able to take his spark and turn it into a fire. Okay. So for all of you guys, the next step in this journey of growth for you is first off to be fascinated and have a spark. And then you got to find the people at the fire. Okay. And you have to go to them humbly and start asking them their questions and don't judge everything based on what the lens of that you view the world through. Find out other people, be open to other opinions, other ideas. It's going to give you a very holistic view and make you, uh, it gives you the ability to serve your people at a much higher level than you ever could by just looking at one angle. Okay. All right. So the first two phases in this formula in this, uh, in this framework are all about growth. Okay. It's your journey to become something bigger. Okay. Become something better. Become the person, the leader that you need to be to lead your people. Now, after you go through these first two phases, number one of dreaming and having a spark, number two is finding people around you, asking them questions, learning from everybody you can, every single piece of, uh, information you can get access to and learning from everybody. Then we start shifting from growth to contribution. Okay. Uh, Alex Sharfin always talks about the call, the contribution, how entrepreneurs feel if they hear the call, the contribution, I need to contribute. I got to create something. I had to do something. I got to go out there. I got to, I got to do something. Right. You guys have heard that call us. Why are you here? Right. You've heard that call the contribution. Like, how do I contribute more? Okay. And so there comes a time in all our lives and keep growing and growing, keep studying and learning. But if you don't start shifting from growth to contribution, you will flat line. Okay. The first time I understood this was true when I was a wrestler. Okay. In college, I was a wrestler in high school. I was a wrestler. Um, uh, I was a state champ in high school, took second place in the country. I was all American high school. I thought I knew everything. Okay. The worst thing could possibly happen to any of us as we think we know everything. I was like, shh, I know everything. I got him such a good wrestler. I remember my senior year after I took second place in the nation. Uh, my coach, Greg Williams, who's now the coach at UVU, he said, Hey, do you want to come coach at the wrestling camp? I was like, I don't know. Like I got girls to date this summer. This is like my big time before going to college. And, uh, he's like, I'll pay a hundred bucks. I'm like, I'm in, let's go. So that's what I, that was the value of my week of my time back then. Uh, so I went to the wrestling camp and he's like, okay, here's some kids. Um, I need you to train them how to wrestle. I'm like, okay. So I go to the kids and I'm like, okay, this is how, and I remember we're teaching a cheap tilt, which is like my move. And I was like, here's how you do a cheap tilt. I show the kids, my cake, go try it. I sit back and the kids come out and they start trying it and nobody gets it even remotely close. They all, like almost all of them are pinning themselves. I'm like, no, you guys, you don't listen to a word I said, hold on. Come back in, come back in. I started, this is how you do a cheap tilt. Okay. No, go do it. And they go back out and everyone's like doing the same thing. He flopping all over the place, pinning themselves. And I'm like, what is wrong with these kids? Like, I sit back. I'm like, what are they doing wrong? I start looking. I'm like, oh my gosh, he's doing it wrong. Cause his hips are like, they keep sliding out and his knee. Like, I never know. Like this knee needs to be the foot's gotta be planted here and these are the points of the ceiling. And then what else? I started looking, I said, come back in, guys, come back in. Look at this. I said, when you're doing it, like, notice, look at my foot set. It's right here. Look at my knees pointed. And they're like, oh, cool. I can go try it again. They start doing it. And all of a sudden the kids start getting better. I was like, huh. And then I bring it back in and go back and forth and back and forth. And for the entire week I spent with these kids. I'm looking at like what I'm doing on my processes and understanding why they work and then figuring that out. And as you start, when the fascinating thing is about a pattern is after you become aware of a pattern, it's like, oh, I know the pattern. Now I can manipulate, I can change, I can grow, I can figure things out based on that. And so for me, like, I'd gotten to a point where I'd grown personally at a certain level and I'd stopped. I was stagnated. And when I shifted and started becoming a coach and helping other people, that's where I started to continue to grow. That's where I shift from growth to contribution. And that's how I got the next level of growth. Okay. So for all of us, there comes that time where as you're growing and you're sharing, the only way to continue to grow is to shift from growth to contribution. So we start coming out there. This is where most entrepreneurship, most businesses start when you're shifting from like, how do I become better to how do I make other people better? Okay. And that's the next level. Way more fulfillment, by the way, on the contribution side. Okay. So that moves us to phase number three, the framework phase. Number three. Now is now we start building our own frameworks. Okay. This is going to be weird for a minute. And I promise you at the end, you're going to be like, oh my gosh, this is amazing. Okay. So we need to start creating our own frameworks. If you notice most of the greatest entrepreneurs, business people, they have their own proprietary frameworks. Okay. So this is the next phase. After you've gone through growth, now you're shifting contribution. This next phase to start creating your own. Okay. So the first step here is you need to create what we call your framework hypothesis. What is my framework to get somebody a certain result? Okay. Let's just say this is me. This could be for any, any business, right? Here's your path. So here's you. You're going on this, this journey up here and this is the result. This is the thing you're trying to get to, right? And so as you've been going through your growth and you've been learning and you were studying, obviously figuring out and you're learning and you're moving yourself up this line. Okay. Now you're like, I think I know how to get here. I'm pretty sure I know how to do that. So based on me interviewing 50 people or like reading a whole bunch of books, whatever that thing is, I'm going to make my hypothesis. I think this is what I need to do to get that result. Okay. We make hypothesis and how to make our hypothesis. This is something Bruce Lee said. Thank you, James Frill for finding this quote for me. But Bruce Lee talked about what you do is you research your own experience. You absorb what's useful and your reject was useless and add essentially, which is your own. Okay. As you're going through this growth phase where you're interviewing a whole bunch of people and you're learning from a whole bunch of experts, the goal is not to like learn everything they say and just believe it as is. Right. There's a lot of like when I was listening to Howard Berg, a lot of his beliefs on God, I agree with a lot of my didn't, didn't mean it was right or wrong. Okay. But I was able to listen to that thing say, well, this is awesome. I'm going to take these gold nuggets. These are the things for me that I believe in that I think can, can add to what I believe. Okay. Same thing here. When you're going through this process of learning and studying and growth, you're looking for the nuggets. Like what are the things that I believe in? Can you take all the different pieces? You take that and say, okay, now that I have this, this is my framework hypothesis. This is what I think is this, is the secret. Okay. So we create our framework hypothesis, which is basically, okay, for me to get this result, I get a step one, step two, step three, and that's how I'm going to get this result. Okay. Now we have hypothesis. That's step number one step number two. Now now that I have hypothesis, this is what I think I'm going to do to get that result. Now we got to go out there and actually test your framework hypothesis on yourself. You have to become a human guinea pig. A lot of people get the ordering wrong. They say, okay, here's my framework hypothesis. Let me go sell something. Like, no, no, no, no, not yet. This is where you got to figure out if it actually works on you. Okay. One of the people I respect a lot is Tim Ferriss. They've called him a lot of times, the human guinea pig. He was one of the original bio hackers and I was reading, I remember which one of his books, but one of his books he was talking about, he implanted something inside of his, his body that I test his blood levels. And every single day to do that, test little things that he would take this supplement, see what happened to his blood levels. They take this and try this and do these things. It said, he took over a thousand blood tests based on all these different things. And after all of a sudden, I said, based on all things I learned, this is the diet that's the best. This is the supplements. These are the things that, that this is the framework that I believe is, is optimal for you to be able to get the result you're trying to get. Okay. So just like Tim Ferriss became a human guinea pig, you've got to become a human guinea pig for your framework at first as well. Okay. So you take that, you say, okay, I think this is the way I get my result. And you go out there on this journey. You know, you go on the journey, what's going to happen is sometimes you're going to go through the process and be like, I was right. I figured it out. I'm at the top. What typically happens is you go on this journey with your framework. A lot of times it doesn't work at first. Right. You try something like, oh, it failed. You try something else. Oh, it failed. Okay. And that's okay. This is the framework hypothesis. You can tweak and say, I'm going to change this. I'm going to change this. So eventually it's like, okay. And eventually you get the top where you have the success and get the result you want. Okay. So now you've got a process. You've got a system that works. I know it works for me. It's worked for me. Um, and so that is the first step here where you become a framework crater. Boom. I have a framework that works. Okay. How many of you guys in this room now have a framework that works for whatever it is you do. Okay. It could be anything from like how to lose weight to how to get a white smile to how to, how to make more money, how to start a business, how to, uh, how to invest in, uh, in whatever, how to save money on taxes. Right. Every business needs to have a framework. Okay. And some of you guys like, well, Russell, this doesn't make sense to me because I don't sell information products. I don't need a framework. This only works for the info people. It's only for authors and speakers. It doesn't work for me because I'm a blah, fill in the blank. Right. Well, we understand that all businesses are about one thing and one thing only. Businesses are about how in the world do I get a client, a result? That's it. Okay. I'm in business to do this, to get this client, this result. Okay. That's you have to understand. And though there's always a framework or a process to get somebody that result. Okay. So the question you got to ask yourself is what is the framework that somebody must follow to get a certain result? Okay. And what's interesting is your products, probably just a piece of that framework. It's not the whole thing. Okay. So what is the framework someone must follow if you want to get a certain result? Okay. So think about whatever business you are. This is the result the person's coming to you with. They want to get out of pain. They want to grow taller. They want to grow hair. They want to, whatever, whatever your business is, right? That's the result. What's the process they have to go through to get that result with you? Okay. And so for example, here's click funnels, right? So click funnels, we have a framework. You guys have seen me talk about frameworks all the time, right? And so we have a framework to help people to grow a company online through funnels. Okay. So that is my framework. And what's interesting about my framework is my, is, is the product, click funnels, the software is just one step in the framework, right? So I'm like, step number one, you got to have an idea. Step number two, you got to create an offer. Step number three, and also like step five is like, now you need click funnels to build the thing, right? If I just came to people like, oh, you need click funnels. This is awesome software. Like why? Like because it's awesome. It makes you can move things and drag and drop. It's really easy. Like I don't get it. But if I'm like, what's the result you want? This is the result you want. Cool. There's a five step framework, step number one, you got to do this. Step number two, step number three. And now you need the, the software for step number four and step number five. That makes sense. So my product becomes part of the framework. It is not the framework. Okay. So let me show you this works for a more traditional company, like a dentist. Okay. So the dentist, if I was a dentist, I would have a framework for how to get white teeth. Okay. You know, there's a whole process, right? And I'm not a dentist. I don't know exactly the process, but they have a framework to get white teeth, right? So when came to me as a dentist, say, I need white teeth. They, cool. First thing you got to do is you got to brush twice a week or not a week. Twice a day. Yeah. Step one, brush twice a, step number two, you got to. Um, you should be using white strips or hydrogen peroxide, step number three, you've got to come to the dentist. My product is like step number three, right? One of the steps is you come to me and we'll do teeth whitening or we'll do a line or whatever the thing is, right? Okay. But I still have a process. If I'm just like, I have a dentist, she's come to me so I can, so I can, uh, clean your teeth. Like it's one thing. It's like, well, what's the, what's the result? The results bigger than that, right? The results of the framework. So here's the framework to get somebody that result and your product becomes one step in the framework. Does that make sense? Same thing. It's just like with e-commerce sellers. If you're selling physical products, okay, my product is a framework to get blank, to get what? Right? And then inside of there, your product becomes part of it, right? So for example, let's say I was selling, um, let's say I was selling flashlights. Um, I might have just a flashlight by itself will sell. But if you look at it, it's me as for a trailer, Ellen story. A lot of times, um, he was the first funnel inside of click phones that blew up to astronomical levels, but he shifted. It was a flashlight at first, but we went from like it being a flashlight to being a survival flashlight. I'm going to show you guys how to be caught, how to, uh, a framework for how to have survival, right? It was like, it wasn't just a flashlight. It was like part of a framework of like, I don't know exactly how you use flashlights for survival. He shined on people's eyes and, and blind them so you can kick them in the shins or something, but, um, but it became part of a framework. Okay. So every product, everything is a framework. What's the result? You're trying to get somebody and your product is a lot of times one piece of the framework. Okay. Now the cool thing about frameworks is you start creating them. Um, we can do frameworks. Like if I could take a framework, I can teach that framework in three minutes or I can teach it in 30 minutes or I can teach it in three hours. Okay. Like I can sit down here and say, okay, guys, I'm going to teach you guys the new traffic secrets book and I could do a three minute presentation and teach you my traffic secret, like the core pieces of the traffic secrets book, right? Or I can say, okay, I'm going to do a 30 minute presentation. Let me teach you the core things. I could bulk it up. I could tell more stories. I could add more things to it. Or if I did three, if I, if I wanted a three hour presentation, I could do that or I could do a three day event just on traffic secrets by itself as well. Okay. So that's something to kind of think through. And the reason why these frameworks are so important as you'll see here in a second is we use frameworks in every aspect of the funnel as you'll see here. Okay. But the first thing I understand is that we can create frameworks really, really quickly. So again, this is a Tom bill you Tom and his wife, Lisa are some of the best framework creators I've ever seen. Um, who follows them on Instagram? Tom or Lisa? Okay. Uh, if not, you guys start following them just so you can see the frameworks and how they do them so often. So I'm going to show you a couple of them. So Tom put together a framework called sleep habits. It's hard to see up here. These are sleep habits. There's six sleep habits to increase your, your sleep. Right. So step number one, stop eating three to four hours before bed. Step number two, uh, use blue blockers, two, three hours for going to bed. Step number three, go to bed early. Step number four, set your, um, intentions separate. And there's his, there's his five steps, six steps frame framework for sleeping better. Okay. Here's another one. Um, he created a framework based on a movie. How many of you guys have ever seen a movie before? Like four of you guys. Who has ever seen a movie before? Okay. So Tom watched the matrix is like, I'm going to show you guys the seven lessons I learned from the matrix and he showed his framework for, um, matrix number one, you can't do it until you believe it. Number two, the world as you perceive it, isn't real and on and on and on. Okay. Here's one that he made his, uh, his framework for surviving Thanksgiving dinner, step number one, minimum of 16 hour fast every day. Step number two. Okay. And they post these all the time. These are just simple little frameworks. Okay. The reason why that I'm showing you guys this right now and I'm talking about the fact that you can create a framework that happens in three minutes versus 30 is because a lot of times I don't want to spend two years building a huge framework. I want to test some stuff out. So on social media, I can post a framework. I knew a podcast posting a framework and see if people care about it. Right. I'm going to show you guys my five step framework for getting more ads, uh, more views on YouTube. Who here wants to see that one? Can't not do that one. Okay. And I post another one. I'm like, who here wants my five step framework to add a hundred thousand people to your list in the next two days? Oh, okay. Sweet. I'm going to go deeper on that. Right. But I could post something on Instagram that here's my five steps system to build a list. And if nobody cares, I don't go deep there. If I post it back, oh, people are freaking out. This is awesome. Let me go deeper. Okay. If I'm like, let's say I'm a dentist. I'm like, okay, I'm going to post a five step framework, how to get, um, coffee stains off your teeth, uh, from home. Who here want that? Hey, you guys don't believe me? I'm not a, anyway, but I could post that real quick and like, oh my gosh, nobody cares. I'm not going to build or I post something else and you start finding out. Right. So it's essentially become quick at creating these little frameworks and putting them out there and testing them to see what are the things that causes people to get excited before you go deeper. Okay. If you guys notice almost every one of my podcast episodes, I think I'm like 600 episodes deep now or more is me sharing a quick framework. That's it. And sometimes you guys don't tell me anything. Okay. That one sucked. But guess how I know when I do a good one, you guys message me, I get tons of magic. Dude, that was, that was fire. Russell, like people in the fire emoji are like, oh, okay. And people go crazy. And I'm like, okay, that's, I'm going to go deeper there. Okay. All this stuff I share on stages like this, our own stage, this is a year of testing and a lot of stuff you guys like don't care about. Those things you guys freak out about. So I'm looking like, what are the frameworks that people are interested in? I'm going to go deeper though. So I'm starting creating those things. Okay. All right. So I understand that frameworks, as you can see, are in every step of the funnel. There's frameworks here at the ad level. There's frameworks here on the opt-in level. Okay. There's frameworks. We were selling in frameworks for upsells. Okay. So I'll show you guys, I'll show you guys this in a lot more detail here in a second. I'm going to show you guys a case study once you see exactly how they fit. Okay. But just imagine to add, just to add like who here wants my three step framework for how to add more blah, blah, blah, blah. Sweet. You click on that boom takes a landing page. Awesome. Give me an email. I just want to give you my sit, my five step framework for how to do whatever. They opt in next page. They cool. I just emailed you the framework. Uh, there's a three hour video me teaching this framework in more detail for 37 bucks. You can have it. Boom. And then we go to like that. Okay. So the framework is what drives people and pulls them from page to page to page throughout. Okay. Step number three, after you've created these frameworks, you have to give your framework a proprietary name. Okay. This way it becomes your own. If you don't do that, then it's just like anybody can rip it off. Like, um, you got to create your own proprietary frameworks. Okay. So for example, I'm going to see how well you guys have been paying attention to me for the last five years. Okay. I'm going to draw something. And when you know what this framework is, I want you to shout it out at the top of your lungs. Okay. You guys ready for this? The first one wins a million. Just kidding. You win nothing. Yeah. Yeah. We're just shouting. Okay. So as you know, the framework is posted out. Yeah. Oh, perfect webinar. Okay. There's my framework for how to run a webinar. Do you know how many leads I have gotten by giving people for free my, uh, my framework for how to run a webinar? Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of leads that people have opted in saying, I want to learn how to do webinar. They give me their email address. I give them the perfect webinar script. And we have a free plus shipping version and we go through there and it's become a huge, huge, huge lead generator for us. That is somehow, you're like, Russell, what is perfect webinar? I have to do with click funnels. Click funnels is even in the framework. Oh, but if you have a webinar that works, you need click funnels to hold. Oh, okay. That's quick test number one. You guys ready for number two? Okay. Let's see what framework. If you guys know what framework is next. Okay. You guys ready for this first thing yells it out wins value ladder. You guys know my frameworks. Okay. There's the value of our framework. Okay. Here's the next one. This is going to be a little trickier. This one has not been as prevalent, but if you were here last year, you should know this one. What's this? What's this? You all failed. Everyone is your last year. Go home. Someone said it. Hook story offered. Okay. I've got one more of my pop quiz. Okay. You guys ready for this one? Loud as you can. I should know what it is. All right. Okay. You guys know my frameworks. How many of us like you could comfortably come up and teach any of these frameworks because you've seen them so many times. Yeah. Nice. My framework is that people off they see the framework, they can remember it. They can reteach it. They can, they can share it. They can grow like it's so, so, so powerful. Have your own frameworks. Tonight after dinner, we are doing a story workshop. I'm going to be going deep into my story frameworks. I just want to make sure you guys come back for that because it's going to be, it's going to be really fun. I put a lot of work into it. We're going to learn how to tell some stories. Okay. If you look at business though, like my entire business just frameworks. How many of you guys read any of these four books? What's that last one? What? Okay. Dot com secrets are all my frameworks for the first 10 years of my business. I put them together in a book. You guys read the book and like, these are amazing. I need to buy click funnels now. Okay. Expert secrets are my frameworks to how to sell, how to put videos and copy on the pages. To convert people as they come through your funnels. Traffic secrets comes out very, very soon, which is the, all the frameworks how we get traffic into our funnels. And unlock the secrets as a secret that I just keep opening looping you guys to tease you. And you're like, what is it? I'm not ever going to tell you, but you'll find out someday. So there's a framework for that about open loops. So there you are. That's framework control company. Right. Okay. If you look at this, it's interesting that there's, there's frameworks that are embedded inside of frameworks. Right. So if you look at expert secrets, and if I needed to do a five second Instagram post, or I wanted to make a, a three minute video about, about, uh, the framework expert secrets, I would go to the table of contents and section one of the book is how to create a massive movement. Step two is beliefs through stories. Step three is your moral obligation. And step four is the exit of the funnels you use. Okay. So there's a framework. It's four step framework for how to become an expert. Okay. I can teach you how to three minutes. But if you look at this inside of each framework, each of these sections of the book, there's a whole bunch of things inside of each section of the book. What are they called? Chapters. So if you, if you break it up bigger chapter one is create your own movement, but then inside of there, there's a framework. There's my, uh, the create your own mass movement. There's five steps. Number one is become the charismatic leader. Number two, the future based cause. Number three, new opportunity. Number four, opportunities switch. Okay. So there's a framework for how to create a mass movement. Now I can go in another step deeper. Like what's the framework for the new opportunity? I have a framework for that as well. Okay. So there's frameworks side of frame, side of frame. This is what we do as entrepreneurs as creators, we're creating frameworks for our people to help get them results. Okay. You understand that? Like that's what our goal is. So as we are going on this journey ourselves and trying to find our voice and become an expert, we're going through the path where we say, I'm trying to get this result for myself first. I'm going through this growth. I'm trying to get the result as I'm going through this path. I'm learning. I'm creating my own framework hypothesis. Like, Oh my gosh, I got a result. I have a framework. I have a, I have a proven system now to get a result. Okay. Which is all business really is. It's what's the result you're trying to get some. Now I have a proven framework to get anybody this result. Okay. So now you got a framework. What do you do? You go sell stuff now? Yeah. No, not yet. You all fail the test. Just because you have a framework does not mean you should go start selling or making money from it. Okay. Just because it worked for you does not mean it's going to work for everybody. I had a mistake when I first got started in this part of the business where I had these funnels work to my business. I started trying to use them on other companies. I realized there were intricacies I didn't understand in my company versus other people's. And it took me a while to respect that enough to say, look, I got to figure out how does this work? Like, what are the changes make it work in a gym versus a dentist versus someone selling physical products? They get to figure out those changes, intricacies. So next step is not for you to go start selling them. The next phase here is for you to start working for free and serving your future dream clients. Okay. You know that the frameworks work for you. It got you the result. And I got to find out if it's going to work for other people as well. This is where you will learn the intricacies of your art. Okay. So I got started in this business and the coaching side of this business. What I didn't do is set up a website or set up a funnel and be like, hey, I'm Russell Brunson. I'm really cool. One time I made a bunch of money. You guys should sign up for my coaching program. Because for two reasons. Number one, you sound like a jerk. And number two, I'd like just because I made money doesn't mean I'm going to help anybody else. Make money. So the next phase means like, well, I'm going to go work for free to see if what I think is right. This hypothesis that have worked for me. I'm going to see if it works for other people. Okay. So what I did, this is right before the whole ClickFunnels journey took off. I met this guy named Drew Canole. How many of you guys know Drew Canole in here? Okay. Yeah. FitLiveTV, they own OrganiFi. And I met Drew and at the time they were kind of struggling in their business a little bit. And it's kind of a crazy. I had a friend in Mutual. And I was going through this juicing phase in my life where I just wanted to juice everything. And Drew's like the juicing guy. So I was like, my wife and I and kids were going to Legoland and Drew lives in San Diego. So I was like, hey, can you introduce me to Drew? I'd love to meet him when I'm out there. And so our co-friend kind of connected us together. And like two days later, I jumped in my very first Uber ride ever. I drove to Drew's house and we sat down. And it was this awkward moment where like, we haven't ever talked before. We got kind of introduced by this third person. Like it's going to be weird. And we're knocking on his door. He opened up and like, hey, do we hug or just like, you know, like the weird internet high like, hi, I've seen your face a lot. And so we let me in and walk in and we walk into his room. I remember in front of my sat down and on the table was one of my first things we said. It's called 108 Split Test. And he hasn't read the 108 Split Test book. It was sitting there. I was like, oh dude, you got my book. And he's like, now that I have your book, the creepiest thing just happened. He's like, I bought your book like two days ago. It showed up. I'm sitting here reading through our split tests. And in my head, I'm thinking, man, wouldn't it be cool if Russell Brunson actually come here and just do these test for us? Because I don't know how we're going to do these. And then like an hour later, Carl calls me and says, hey, this guy named Russell Brunson wants to meet you. He's coming to your house. And now you're sitting here in my living room. I was like, that is the weirdest, creepiest thing ever. So I went there, hang out with Drew and get to know him a little bit. And this is one of the first products that they were selling at the time. And I felt I could tell that like, I tell they were kind of struggling. And I was like, hey, I'm writing this book. It's called dot com secrets. It's not out yet. But I'm kind of writing this book and we're working on this thing. And like, I would love to come out and just like help you guys out. He's like, well, what would it cost? I'm like, well, let's do it for free. Like, why would you do that? I'm like, I don't know, because I have no idea if it's going to work or not. Like, I don't want to charge you. It works for me. I think it'll work for you, but I don't, I'm not really sure. And like, I would love to, and I love what you're doing. I love your mission. Can I come help you for free? And we kind of went back and forth. He's like, he's like, what's in it for you? I'm like, I don't know. I'm sure if something awesome happens, it'll be great. But I just want to come in and just work for free. So finally he agreed to, I flew out there, got him and his team in a little conference room. We didn't have whiteboard, so I had whiting on the windows because I can't write or can't teach that doodling. We wrote on the windows, build a whole bunch of stuff out. About this time they were working on a green drink. We helped them to kind of figure out the funnel for that to launch it. And when this, when this got done, they launched Organifi a little shortly afterwards and completely transformed their company. They went from a struggling company to, I'm not at liberty to share their numbers, but they are in the high eight figures killing right now with Organifi. So after doing that, I was like, oh my gosh, this stuff does work for other people. And then after that, Drew went and made a video telling the story and like, hey, Russell came to us. We were struggling. He gave us his frameworks, gave us his funnels. We launched it. This is what happened. I took that, I took that video, I put it up on a page and said, hey, Drew, thanks. I'm awesome. If you want to work for me like Drew did, apply down below. And that's why I created my inner circle program that we filled up with a hundred people off the backs initially of this video. Okay. So that's the key, you guys. After the framework, after works for yourself, now you go out and you work for free for the people to find out of what you're doing, what you're creating. If it's going to work for other people as well. This is a step, by the way, that most people miss. They create a framework and they try to start selling it. And they go, oh, my funnel is not working. It's like, because there's no social proof. There's no, like, I don't know if this is actually going to work for me. It worked for you, sure. But what is it going to work for me? Like I'm in a different business. I do something completely separate because it worked for me as well. Okay. So go out there and work for free to prove that what you're doing actually works. Okay. And that moves us now to step number five. And this is where you become an expert, where you start finding your voice. Okay. I'm a huge believer that your results are your qualifications. Okay. This is how you qualify yourself. Um, as you guys heard earlier, I got to see my marketing class. So I'd have no marketing degree. Um, yet we arguably run one of the biggest marketing training companies on the planet earth. Um, okay. Our results are our qualification. You guys are the same thing. You have to understand that. After you've proven for yourself, you prove for other people like that's your qualifications to go out there and start creating and sharing. Okay. So tomorrow I'm going to be talking deeper on value ladder stuff. Um, but I was going to share, if those who understand the value ladder in this concept right now, I want to share that the each step in the value ladder, there are, there are frameworks. Okay. There's frameworks at the bottom of the value ladder as you start moving up. If you look at the transition point, usually when you're moving up to value ladder, providing more value and charging more money at the, at the lower tier, it's like people are doing the framework themselves. You give them a framework. They opt in, they get downloaded. They're on their own. They give it to themselves. Right. As they move up to the value ladder, it's like, Hey, if you pay me something, I'll do it for you or do it. I'll do it with you. Okay. And you move up the value higher. So I'll do it for you and then even higher some kind of combination of, of, of both. Okay. So let me show you guys a framework in action. I mean, I just want to see this whole process in action, an actual funnel. It's killing it right now inside of click funnels. Okay. All right. So I'm going to show you guys pain, June's fun. Hopefully pain, June is a okay with this. He made me do a cameo for his infomercial or for his new, his new music video last night. So I feel like he owes me. So I'm going to show his funnel. Um, we're funnel hacking. I bought it like 400 times for you guys. So he made a lot of money on this already, but I want to show you guys behind the scenes of how paying perfectly used this framework in action. How many of us were in funnel hacking life? Two years ago when he, uh, three years ago, when he gave his presentation on this content machine. Okay. So he came and did a presentation for 30 minutes and that presentation became the whole foundation that framework. He taught a funnel hacking live and 30 minutes became the framework for this entire funnel that I'm going to show you guys, but it could, and. Paying is kind of like me and he's got ADD and he has like 500 things happening. But if he wanted to, this and this alone could be his entire business. Okay. All based on one framework. Okay. So I'm going to show this work. So this is the very beginning of the framework. The framework starts as an ad. And if you zoom in here, make it a little bigger so I can see it here. If you read his ad, it says, um, who here wants me to reveal my nine step system for telling them blah, blah, blah. Okay. So this is his framework. His nine step system. Okay. This is the ad he runs on Facebook. Okay. So that's the first step here. So the first he's that ad on the framework, come here to get my nine step system. Right. Someone reads the ad. They say, oh, that framework was awesome. I want to get the result. He's promised me by following this framework. So they click on the ad and then take some step number two here, which is, uh, the special offer. Okay. So paying special offer is to do it yourself. It's a book. Okay. Which is literally the transcripts of his presentation here at Funnel Hacking Live with pictures of the slides. It's pretty amazing. Okay. So this is like a free plus shipping by this book. You can do it yourself. You can go read the thing and then you're off on your own. You can get yourself. Okay. It's free. Just pay shipping and handling the bottom tier of the value ladder. Right. Okay. Huge sense, huge percentage of people that click on the ad line on this page. Like sweet. This book looks awesome. I want the framework. They order it. He should sell the framework and then get the framework in their hands. Do it yourself. Okay. So they're step number two there in, in the process. Okay. Now after somebody buys that, now paying is immediately starts moving them up the value ladder within the same framework. Okay. So now it moves to upsell number one. So this first upsell is like, cool, you just got the book. I'm shipping it out to you. You're going to be able to read it and learn how to do it yourself. But how would you like to do it with me? I actually created a whole entire video course. It's way bigger than what's inside the book where you can see here and we can go for the next six weeks and you can do it with me. I'll train you. You listen, you go and implement it. We go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Okay. Is it done for you thing? So the upsell is the same framework, but you should have to from, um, from do it, do it yourself. So I'm going to do it with you. Okay. And this is the first up. So I think he sells this for 297 bucks. I believe. Okay. Then that's up. So number one, now he moves up. So number two, which by the way is the same framework. He's just moving it up the value ladder. So the next, uh, so up so number two now is okay. You bought the, you bought the book. How would you like from my team to do it for you? Okay. We could create all the ads and the banners and the, the, all the content, things you need and every single month we're going to ship you out, uh, or excuse me, every month we'll, we'll, um, give you a whole bunch of things you can download and we'll do this whole process for you. You just plug your videos in and you've got it all done for you. Okay. And this one is, what's he charged for it? It's an $897 a year or 97 bucks a month. Okay. And so he's taking that same framework framework didn't shift, right? Still the framework for how to get more people, uh, on video, we shifted how it was fulfilled. Now it's done for you. I'll just do it for you and charges is almost a thousand bucks for that. Okay. So that's up. So number two, and then on the thank you page, he has a webinar where you come and you register for the webinar and the webinar is a combination where he sells a $3,000 version where they, they do even more for you. And it's a combination of doing done for you, done with you, bunch of other things like that. And that moves it through. Okay. But that's one framework that pain created. Okay. This framework, this funnel does really, really well. And if he, but I want you to understand, like, if this was, if this was his only business, it could be, right? This alone is a two comic club business by itself. If he just folks on that alone. Okay. From one framework, how many of you guys think you could develop a framework to show people how to get the result in the whatever businesses that you actually do. Okay. It's not that difficult. So it's understanding that that's these frameworks. That's what they are. Okay. Most of the offers were created based on some type of framework. So we have to come really, really, really, really, really good at creating frameworks. I want you to pause for a second and look back in time of everything you've experienced with me before you got here today. The reason why you're in this room is because somewhere along the line, you saw a framework and clicked on it. And somewhere along the line, you opt in for a framework. Some of you bought a framework and then you went through this thing and like, you guys are here today. This entire event is a framework. Okay. I'm going to framework to help you guys to get into the two comic club. Like that's the whole goal of this event. Right. How do we train people to educate them to get them into the spot where they can get the award on stage with us in two days from now. Right. That's the whole framework that we build this whole event around. People ask me every single year, Russell, I want to speak in front of like alive. I want to speak in front of like alive. I'm like, you don't understand. I don't pick speakers. I build a framework and I find it. Who's the best speaker for each step of the framework? Okay. That's how we orchestrate this entire event. Okay. You will notice as you go through every single speaker who gets on the stage, we'll have a framework for something. Okay. They all have received some kind of result and they're going to give you their framework for that result. Here's what you do. Step one, step two, step three, step four. The way he is looking at through all these presentations through that lens, like, what's the framework? What's the frame where we get? I have the process. I have it now. I can go back and I can implement it. That's one lens. But the other thing I was thinking through was like, as you start seeing this and see how I teach my frameworks, how other people teach their frameworks is understanding like this is the business to worry in. Okay. I don't care if you're a dentist, a chiropractor, a supplement seller, physical product, selling info, coaching, consulting, whatever it is. Like this, if you understand how to package things in the frameworks, now you've got sexy ads, now you've got amazing options. Now you've got all the things you need to generate leads to get people coming into your world. You have a proprietary thing that's unique to you versus everybody else. Okay. Especially if you're selling in commodity, especially if you're a local business where there's 500 other people doing exactly what you do in your hometown. If you start developing your own frameworks, your own proprietary process that's different, now you've got an advantage over everybody else. Okay. So this is the process of going from growth to contribution. We go from the dreamer to the reporter, the framework creator to the servant, to our expert in our guide. So that's the framework about how to find your voice. You guys like that? Okay. All right. Now we're going to move to the next framework, which is my framework for teaching frameworks. You guys get that? Yeah. I'm teaching you my framework for how to teach frameworks. And this is one that's that I'm really excited about sharing with you guys. This is one that took me a long time to figure out. How to do this. And it wasn't something that was like, like somebody taught me, it was like, tons of time like this on stages where like, I have an idea, I have something big I want to share with people. I try to share it and like it hits and it kind of falls dead. I'm like, ah, that didn't work. Right. And so doing this for a long time, this is kind of the framework I developed. And so I'm excited to share it with you guys. Okay. First thing I understand, I learned from Brendan Bouchard who spoke last year's Funalaki Live. In fact, I was at an event with him. It was a small mastermind group and we're all sitting there and the person hosting it was like, Hey, Brendan, do you want to show everybody your seven day launch funnel? Which you guys, how many of you guys watched that last year Funalaki Live? Amazing, right? And he's like, Oh, sure. Give me, give me like 10 seconds. I'll be ready. He jumps up, gets the whiteboard and he's like, okay. And he draws like four or five squares and circles and angles. He's like, okay, boom. He's like, this is my framework for the seven day launch funnel. And he said something. Oh, and then he started teaching. He's like, first step of the frame where he's taught that second step. And then people ask him questions and he get derailed and he come back, keep going. And someone else asked me a question, he gets derailed. And I'm so sorry. I keep asking you questions. He said, no, don't worry about it. He's, you understand the framework is your savior. So the thing that saves you is you get, is you drift off your teachings. Like, where do I go from here? Oh, back to the framework. And the framework keeps you in mind and make sure that what you're saying follows a process that other people can follow as well. Okay. So it's important to have these frameworks as you're teaching, as you're sharing, as you're giving, because everything you're doing from the, again, from the ads, the videos are all following a framework. Okay. All right. So the first phase in the framework. Okay. The first phase. Um, we're telling a framework is you have to explain the story about how you learned or you earned that thing. Yes. That's a picture of me with a black eye. This is Nate Plone. He's the guy I made a potato gun DVD with me. We were wrestling in practice one day and I took a shot and I shot with my head down, which is not good. And I was punished. My eye hit his knee, swole my eyes shut for a week, about a hundred stitches there, and it was a really cool thing. So I just wanted to put that picture there because it's amazing. So, uh, okay. So the first step when we were teaching a framework, you have to tell the story about how you learned or you earned it. Okay. Um, I learned this the hard way. A lot of times, um, when I was learning this, when I was, when I was first kind of developing these ideas, I would come and I would spend insane amounts of hours and time in my life, like testing out a concept and figuring out and like, figuring out how to funnel works. Like, come to an event like this. I'm so excited to share it. Like, you guys, this is how it works. I share how it works. I never sit in there like, uh, okay. I'm like, what? Like, did you not get it? Like, let me explain again. I show the process. Like, yeah, no, we heard the process. Like that, that's good. Thank you. Like, no, like, do you, do you understand? Like what I had to go through to get this. And they're like, no, I don't understand. And I felt like if you guys read the, um, the New Testament, when Christ talks about not throwing your pearls before swine, like I felt like that. I was like, I spent so much time learning and figuring out this thing. And I gave it to you and you're like, Oh, cool. Did you not understand what I went through to learn that or to earn it? And so I remember, uh, at one event, particularly, I was sharing something three or four times. I got so mad, so frustrated that nobody was getting what I was trying to share with them. I said, look, let me explain to you exactly how to go through to get this. I said, I went this and I told this whole horrible story about how the time and the effort and the stress and the, and how much money I put into it to learn this thing. And I said, Oh, do you guys get that? And then I went and I shared the thing again and people are like, Oh my gosh, that was amazing. I was like, interesting. I taught the exact same thing. The only difference is that here I put them through a pre-frame where I explained how I learned or I earned it. The story provided value to the framework. If I just give you a framework, I go, Oh, thanks. Like if I just hand you the perfect webinar, this is the perfect webinar framework. You should go to the webinar on this. You're like, okay, thanks. But if I talked to you about how I spent 10 years on stages like this. Okay. Doing pitches where nobody ran the back of them. I got embarrassed time after time after time going on the road, spending my own money, spending my way and sitting in the back room, watching speaker after speaker, taking notes on what they did and how they did it, how they spoke, where they moved, what they did. Like, and I studied that spent 10 years of my life and based on that, I built the framework that anybody can follow. All of a sudden you're like, Oh my gosh, like I need that framework. Okay. If the first step in teaching any framework is you have to tell the story about how you learned or you earned it. If not the audience will not value it. So number one, okay. So without the story, nobody will buy into the strategy. Okay. So phase number two, now I'm going to move into strategy without the story. Nobody will care about the strategy. Okay. Now phase number two, this is where I teach the strategy. Okay. And people get confused on strategy and tactics. Strategy is like the overarching view. Like if I'm from a whiteboard, I'm like, here's the step one, two, three. Like that's the strategy, right? Okay. And people have to understand the strategy because they don't understand the strategy. They're not going to pay attention when you get to the tactics. Okay. So if I was going to go to war, if I just come into a big, you know, into my army and my cave, I need you guys to go over here, start killing people. You guys go here. We're going to attack everyone. Like I want you to go this way and this way. And they're like, why am I just doing like this? Like just trust me. Go. And they're like, I don't think you know what you're talking about. Right. Cause I just gave them the tactics. So here's tactic. We're going to do it. If I come into the kids, this is the strategy. This is the game plan. Let me explain. I explain the whole game plan. They're like, oh my gosh, that is brilliant. Now anything I tell them tactically, they're going to do because they have to tell them how they learned or I earned it. Then I transition out to the strategy. Here's, here's exactly what you need to do. And I walk through the process. Okay. A lot of times my strategy are like, here's five steps. Here's my doodle. Here's the, the step by step process they see from a high level of you. They see the strategy. Okay. Now if they buy into the strategy, I think it's my next slide. Yeah. Cause without the strategy, no one's going to buy into the tactics. Okay. So I tell the story to provide value of the strategy. Then I tell the strategy, they buy into that. Now it's like, now I can get into the tactics. Okay. So if you, if I go back one slide, if the strategy is, okay, is what I would put on a white board, then it's the tactics or what I would put in a Trello board. Okay. All right. Here's all the steps. Step one, step two, step three, step four, step five. Here's all the process. Here's all the things you got to do to get that step of the, of the strategy done. Here's all the tactics. Okay. So I share the tactics next. Okay. That's all the to-dos, all the things, all the pieces that I do to achieve that thing. Okay. And then the last phase we share a case study. Cause without a case study, they may believe that thing is possible for, for you. They're not going to leave as possible for them. So in phase number four, then we give social proof and we share the strategy. Okay. So here is the actual strategy or excuse me, this is the case study of other people applying this framework. Okay. Let me go backwards to my slides. I'm going to show you guys the, the overarching one again. Oops. Too far. Okay. So this is how I teach my frameworks. Okay. Again, number one, I turn to the story of how I learned, how I earned it. Number two, the strategy about what it is. Number three, the tactics about how, and then number four, the social proof examples. Okay. And that's how I teach all my frameworks. Okay. All right. I got one other thing I want to share with you guys. Now I want to show you guys my framework for selling frameworks. Okay. It's very similar, but it's different. Okay. When I'm teaching a framework, I teach all those things. When I'm selling is different. When I'm selling number one, I still tell about how I learned or I earned it. Number two, I still teach this strategy, but I don't teach the tactics. And I share the case studies. Okay. What somebody typically is buying from you is the tactical. It's here's the process. Here's what it is. Okay. So if I'm selling something, I don't teach, I don't do number three. I do number one, two, and number four. Okay. So let me show you an example of this. So, um, I mean, as you see my final lecture presentation, it's the presentation, the bill, click funnels, if you haven't seen it yet, that's shocking to me because I did that webinar live over a hundred times and it's been on auto webinar for four years now. And it's sold a hundred million dollars plus of click funnels. So you haven't seen it yet. You should at least watch it because it's really good. Put a lot of effort into it. Um, but if you look at this, like watch how my slides mimic this process, okay. So number one, I tell the story about how I learned or I earned secret number one. Right. So I talk about Tony Robbins taught me how to achieve success. You gotta do this. And then I talk about the pioneers. I talk about Porter Stansbear. I tell the story about how I learned to earn this tactic. Right. Then I switch over to the strategy. Okay. Here's the strategy. Step number one, I'm going to share my framework for my funnel hacks. Step number one, you got to funnel hacks on the successful step. Number two, you got to buy the product. Step from three, the stress improvement system, four, building click funnels. Oh, by the way, my product eventually actually step number four. I still have a framework for success for them. Right. Then I skip number three. Okay. Cause number three would be like, okay, let me show you a 50 step, six step tutorial about how to actually build your funnel and click funnels. Let me show it. You know, I think I skipped that and I go directly to the social proof. Here's Organifi. Here's what we do at their funnel. Boom. Okay. And that's how I taught that section of framework. And I move on to secret number two in my, in my framework. Okay. Same thing. I start right here with, um, with how I learned or I earned it back in the past. What we had to do, we'd have programmers and designers and analytics people in super hard. I had the tech guy into this and then this and this, but then we figured out a new way, a better way. Let me show you the strategy. Then I do my demo, click funnels and the demo click funnel shows the strategy. Step one, I pick a template. Step two, I pick the funnel type. Step three, I walk through the, the, the framework for how I build a funnel. So I click funnels, right? And from there, I skip number three and then I go into number four, which is here's the case study. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, okay. All right. Same thing now, secret number three, same thing. Okay. Number one, I tell how I learned, I earned it. Okay. Google slapped me again. Here's the framework. Step number one, I figured out, uh, where are the people getting the traffic from? Step number two, I go to similar web, step number three, I look at this, step number four, I go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and I go through the whole, the whole framework of how I get traffic. And then from there, I end with a case study of how it actually happened. Okay. Do you see how that works? So when I'm, when I'm selling through a framework, I teach number one, how we learned to, we earned it. Number two, I teach a strategy. The number three, I show the social proof. Thank you. If any of you guys in YAHAS. Okay. Um, I'm dropping some things now. We're going to, throughout this week, I'm going to be sharing other frameworks. So we're going to talk about the story selling framework tonight, uh, after dinner, which is going to be going deeper into like the story parts of stuff and how we, how we craft the stories and we orchestrate them, all those kinds of things. Um, it's going to be really cool. But we're going to kind of close this down with this week. You guys don't want you to understand that, um, I'm going to be showing you guys a lot of frameworks. In fact, some of my presentations are like 10 minutes of the long, I come down and I'm like, Hey, I got to show you guys a quick framework. I'm going to go for 10 minutes on a framework. I'm bouncing back out again and the next speaker will be out. Okay. Everyone of our speakers is going to be showing their framework for success. Okay. When you guys see the framework, understand it, start mastering these frameworks. As you're doing that, okay? So master the frameworks you're going to be giving during final locking live. And then number two is as you're thinking through it, start designing what are the frameworks for your business? Okay. Come back to this. Like what is the result that my dream customer is paying me for? And I don't care what business you're in. They're all paying you for a result. It's the only reason why people buy stuff. They want a result. What is the result and start thinking, what's my framework? What could it be? I got to figure out a name for it. I got to figure out like, what am I going to title with step one? It's the two, step three. What's my hypothesis? I got to create like, this is what I think is right. And then I got to go back home. I got to be a human guinea pig and test it on myself. See if I can get it to work for me. And if it does work for me, then I got to go and find out that people make it sure works for them. And when I have this framework, oh my gosh, this becomes my ads and my opt-ins and my thing and I can sell all sorts of things around that. Okay. But that's really what you guys understand. Is this lens of frameworks for me talking about, we're going to be doing so many things throughout this weekend about it. Why are you guys understanding that and getting excited about developing your own frameworks? Um, and hopefully you start looking backwards in time about like, oh my gosh, here's all the different frameworks that I've seen Russell use on me. Um, I doodle four of them. You guys are going to pick out the name of them just by seeing my doodles. Like that's the power of what we're doing. Create things that your customers remember over and over and over again. Okay. And if you guys are now who've gone through the perfect webinar framework training, if you get on a webinar, you're stuck like, what do I do? What do I do? You look at the doodle, you look at the doodle, you're like, oh, I know exactly what to do. Right. It gives you ability to serve your customers at a higher level than you could buy any other thing, any other way. Um, when you start creating your own frameworks. Okay. And so, um, that's what I got for this intro session. You guys, I'm excited for the next four days. I'm going to be on stage, I think three more times today. We've got a lot more to cover, a lot more things to do with that. So I'm going to bring Devon back out and set up the next speaker. Thank you guys so much.
