## Transcript
You guys believe it's like been another year since last year and we're here again? Funnel hacking live started as the ClickFunnels user conference I guess you would say. People just kept asking me and finally I was like alright let's go for it, let's tune them in. We sat down and said if we are going to do this it's not what everyone else is doing, we have to do something that's better, people deserve something more. You put on an event like this, it takes an army of amazing people. Whiteboard room, whiteboard, whiteboard, whiteboard, these are all maxed out and none of my six presentations are done. Who would be the ideal person? Who's that dream person we want to get? Our goal and mission was to make it the best experience for every single attendee. It's the goal to be the pattern interrupt to bring magic every single day. And the goal for us is like to be an example like this is what's possible. Like what's the end result you're trying to get for your customers coming to the event? What is the thing that they're looking for? And so your event is a vehicle to get them there. How does it do that? That's what you've got to figure out. Thank you.
