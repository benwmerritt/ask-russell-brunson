## Transcript
for anyone watching and listening. It's like, look at everything you're doing in marketing today and ask yourself, does this get someone to raise their hand? Or am I already asking them for money and we're not even in a relationship yet? That's really a good way to figure out what you're doing. Yeah. How do we get their attention? How do we get them to stop? How do we get them to want more? Yeah. And they create the desire. I think that's the danger a lot of marketers have today, is they're assuming when they go to put out their marketing copy, they're assuming that people are already saying, tell me more. When really you haven't done part one, which is all the stuff that you're doing. This tell me more. How much is it? And marketers getting trouble because they're like, raise your hand. Come on, get it up there. Yeah. Yeah. You want me to talk about my offer? Yeah. Yeah. I'll raise that hand. Yeah. And then it's like offensive. It's not a, it's not a collaboration, you know, communication between the two. Today I'm with a special guest and this is probably also going to his podcast. So this is, this is a dual podcast. His name is Steve Jay Larson. Steve, how are you today? Whoo. Excited to be here. I'm excited to have you here, man. This is like, when we first moved into this building, you were part of it. You were helping me knock down walls and build the whole thing. And we sat in here for all day and all night for years. Long time. What many hours. So it's awesome having you back. And if you're a podcast, where do people subscribe to get onto yours? Yeah. It's just Steve Jay Larson.com and talk all things business and life. Cool. So this is, I'm excited for this one because we have an event coming up really soon called dramatic demonstrations, which is something you mean you've been geeking out about for the last two or three years. And so I thought it'd be fun just to kind of brainstorm and talk about dramatic demonstrations and get people excited about what they are and what they're not. Do we have a link right now where they could register? I know we're doing a pre event for people who want to come watch it ahead of time. Do we have a link for that? Yeah. Yeah. Dramatic demonstrations.com. Oh, what a great domain. How do we know? So, and we're doing a three, like a three hour pre event, right? Yeah. Yeah. It's like a, like a preview. Like here's what it's about. Yeah. So you can register that for free, which you should. And then come onto the live event if you guys want to come hang out with us. So that's kind of the longterm anyway, in the short term of the next hour. So we're going to talk about dramatic demonstrations. So I'm trying to get the chicken. Hey, when did we first start talking about this? Do you remember? Yeah. I remember it was like 2019. The world was about to shut down and I was even like a nerd out sesh on the whiteboard and I was like, oh, you know, I wonder if there's any weird patterns on how PT Barnum did these launches, you know, how we used marketing. And as I started listening out all these big famous stories, I was like, oh my gosh, he has like a launch model every time he launched anything. And whether or not it was a product that no one had ever heard of, or there's a product that everyone knew of and he was trying to out position somebody else. And I remember I was dropping something off at your house. I don't know if you remember this, but we were getting ready for FHL 2020. And I'm walking out and I was like, Hey man, you know that look and you and I have that look and crazy look. Yeah. So it's crazy marketing look. Like I got a brain dump this to somebody who understands it. And I remember just vomited on you for like an hour and a half. And FHL happened. And then it was like six months later, we're like, that was cool. We should do something. It's kind of where it came from. So cool. I remember because for me, I was, I was reading Dan Kennedy book and in one of the chapters, he said the phrase about, he said that phrase dramatic demonstrations. I was like, Oh, like, that's what this is. Like it's, it's not like, you know, people are like, do a product demo, do whatever. So you know, it needed to be bigger. And I heard that phrase in Dan Kennedy. I think this is what I bought the domain name. I'm like, I need to buy this. And then we start talking. I was like, this is the thing we should talk about dramatic demonstrations. And by the way, those who are watching the video version in my hand, I've got a little mini PT Barnum. He's here with us today. This is actually homework made these PT Barnum dolls back in 1979. So this doll is older than I am. So this PT, so, you know, in memory of PT Barnum and all the greats we're talking about, um, he's here with us today. So that's the, the weird little dude who's in there on stage. If you're wondering who he is. So I'm just going to start buying a bunch of those and like stack them on your car, a little voodoo. Don't. Barnum everywhere. So I think this is fun because, um, I think both you and I, maybe it's because we hung out for so long for so many years. Like we both geek out on, um, on people and figures from the past and marketing from the past, right? For me, it really started because of Dan Kennedy. You know, I got in his world, I was doing it at marketing and he was talking about fax machines. And first I was like, what does it have to do with, with me? And then later I realized what, you know, how I could apply it to my business. And so for me, I started geeking out, looking at old people's stuff, just like you did, and then you've gone kind of the same route. So I don't know where that all came from, but, um, was PT Barnum the first one you kind of studied when you were looking deeper than other people as well? No, actually it was, uh, it was because of you. I was doing an event early 2019 and, uh, you reach, it's actually when you keynoted it at, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, 600 people, right? And then I remember after the fact, you said to me, you sent me a message and you go, have you ever studied Claude Hopkins? I was like, no, I don't know who that is. And he goes, you said Claude. Yeah. You're like, Claude Hopkins is like the original scheme man or offer guy. At least to come, you know, you told me, right? They used to call him scheme then. But they're cool name. Oh, she can still call schemes. We've got such a negative connotation about they used to call people scheme man, and that was the person who created the offer and a company was a scheme man. Yeah. Such a cool name. And that's like a weird thing, but like back then I had totally different meaning and then that's when I started just kind of like peeling back the layers of the onion. And I was like, this is awesome. And then I got into Albert Lasker and just all these, all these different people. And then that's when Barnum came up. It's like, who's this guy? And then there was like, oh, he's the most prolific of them all. Yeah. He was like, at 10 X the amount of volume and content compared to all the others. And so it was just fun to go deep. What's interesting is, uh, as you know, the very first, um, time we spoke at the funnel, I can learn about dramatic demonstrations. We talked about PT Barnum. And then I think you have the idea of reasoning. We should get PT Barnum, but to call a club award. So during the event, like the, the, the screen opens and they bring out a big, old statue or a big cut out of PT Barnum and we give an award. But what's interesting is he actually was the second, you knew it's not, I mean, he's a second millionaire in US history, right? Yeah. Second millionaire in America. It's great. Who was the first one? Oh, he was a drug dealer actually. So see, yeah. So drugs, so drugs or yeah, or entertainment. But for me, I think the first one. So when I got into business, Matt Fury was the first people I studied. He was, he's not doing a lot of stuff nowadays. So a lot of people don't know who he is, but he was an amazing marketer. I mean, he was in the wrestling space initially. So I started buying his wrestling courses while I was wrestling, not knowing anything about business or anything. And he had this course that came out. It was like, it was the farmer burns course. It was this old guy from 1919. He was a, he was this, uh, wrestling coach and stuff. I remember that guy, right? Yeah. Yeah. It was like, I spent like, it was like $50 for this book and I'm in high school kids. I'm like saving up money to buy this farmer burns wrestling course in the 1900s, cause he had talked about the old guys, how they, they were way tough for this nowadays. And, um, and I remember on the sales letter we sell in the course, Matt Fury told this story and you see to my gym, I have a pitch. I found an actual picture on eBay. So what, uh, what farmer burns is to do. And this is a perfect example of a dramatic demonstration. So, um, he was trying to sell his wrestling course. So he would go to city fairs all across the country, Nebraska, Iowa, whatever. And he'd go to city fairs and he would set up a hangman's noose. He'd wrap an entire thing around his neck and then they would pull the, the, the floor and floor drop and they'd do like the six inch or a six foot drop, which normally break a per, like that's how people die. They did. People think that the strangling you die from being strangled, you just the drop and it breaks your neck and that's how you die and you're laying there hung. So they would do that. He would drop and his neck was so thick. He'd sit there and he whistled Yankee doodle dandy while the crowd went crazy around him and then he'd sell the wrestling course and he went from city to city to city. That's how he became farmer burns. Is this crazy dramatic demonstration? Right. And it's like, cause back then they didn't have TV or internet or anything. It's like, we had to do something amazing to get attention. So that's what, that's what these guys were doing. And like nowadays people are so lazy that they just like put up at Facebook ad and a funnel and hold for the best, right? Yeah. I think that's what we're trying to inspire people. It's like, no, they do, do amazing things, um, to get people's attention. And I've loved you to talk about some of, I know there's so many cool P.G. Barnum stories, but any of them that you can share that just gets people wills and heads spinning like how people were doing then and then maybe we can dive into nowadays, like what, what we're doing. Yeah. Totally. You know, the, the only immediate comes to mind is actually the Jenny Lynn story. I love the story. There's whole books on this. Um, Jenny Lynn was basically America's first female rock star and, uh, but she was really a nobody in America. So the story goes that, you know, P.T. Barnum is a little bit later in his career and he had this reputation and I'm up with the public of being a hoaxman. And so in efforts to like be seen more professionally, he's like, I'm going to go work with someone who's like big and famous. I'm going to be more classy, more classy. That's like the whole motivation he had for it was just change how the public psalm. So he goes in, he's like, he's like, oh, I love Jenny Lynn, famous opera singer in America. And, uh, what if I started partnering with her and I'm going to have her come to America, I'll sell out her shows. She'll sing her opera, you know, and, uh, she'll be a business partner in mine. And so he's psyched about it. Goes into a little bit of debt to bring her to America, you know, across the ship. And, um, as he's like stoked about it, he's, the story goes that he's walking down the street and he's like, you know, woohoo, I'm bringing, I'm bringing Jenny Lynn to America. Jenny Lynn's coming to America. And he's not really getting the reaction he wants. And he's saying it to people as he walks down the street, a doorman goes to open the door and, uh, he's like, who's Jenny Lynn? And it's at that moment that he realizes, oh my gosh, I'm bringing a nobody. Like no one knows who this lady is. I, he's a centric, you know, he found out who he's obviously wealthy. So he has the resources to kind of learn outside of America at that point and no internet, you know, and so he is, uh, Oh my gosh. I have to go figure out how to basically get a no one famous. And the reason I love this story is because entrepreneurs, they, as they go create a brand new offer for behind the scenes, you know, it's kind of like Jenny Lynn, no one knows who she is. No one knows that the entrepreneurs made this offer and PT Barnum made her into into a somebody as she's on the ship. And so he, he first gets, um, all these reporters to just create story about her in the news. And the challenge was that no one had ever really seen her before because there's no internet. And so these artists are like practicing pictures of her and they're trying to guess what no one had ever heard of sing either. And, uh, you know, so they start like, Hey, here's what she's like, her personality, her dislikes. And so he starts creating this character that no one's ever met, but just the idea of it in people's brains. But then he goes out and he's starting to have like, he auctions tickets to the events. He has a poetic competition and all these poets do these, uh, you know, she's, she's not even to America yet. Right. And, uh, these poetic competitions and on the dock where the ship's going to arrive, he asked Jenny Lynn swag and bakery. Good. They actually ended up coining it. Lindomania because, and she didn't know this was going to happen. So she arrives on the ship and there's such hysteria, like true, legitimate, first time in America hysteria over a celebrity that PT Barnum created from someone no one had ever heard of before. 30,000 people show up at the docks and there's like these stories of all these men paying maids to steal hairs from her comb. Like really like weird stuff. Like people weird back then too. Yeah. It's not just nowadays. No, it's still around. It's just easier with tech. So it's funny because like this is like the first real story though, where, where some like celebrity was created out of nothing at a thin air and she didn't know this was going to happen. And so she kind of broke up the band after a while, like 90 shows in, just got tired of him and, uh, she couldn't sell any shows. And I think it's one of the biggest parts to it is that as soon as the noise machine ended and Barnum stopped putting stories in the press and he stopped doing competitions and JVs of that day with other opera singers, like the money dried up, like what a powerful story. And so like at the heart of it, the thing that I take from that is that at the heart marketers are event throwers, you know, and we might do an event in so many different ways today, but it's like, we're, that's really what we do. Yeah. Yeah. Magnificent administration is key. Yeah. And one thing for those who have seen the greatest showman and know Jenny Lynn through that, they did not ever have an affair, like was portrayed in the movie. I was Hollywood trying to ruin his image. Little PT Barnum here in my hand. He never did that kind of thing. He's great. So yeah. In fact, funny if Barnum's wife and Jenny Lynn did not get along. Oh yeah. I can imagine that. She called PT a cow several times and anyway, let me get along. That's hilarious. Yeah. Um, okay. So I want to talk about that then like for people listening to this, cause. You know, obviously mean you geek out on the stories back then, but everyone's like, well, how does this work for me today? Like what does that even look like? And so, um, I think it'd be fun to just go back and forth on just stuff we've done the past. I was just, as you were talking, I think like funnel hacking lives, a good example of an offer that we do every single year. And it's a, it's for us, the hardest thing we sell events are hard to sell because you got to get somebody convinced that they got to take time off work and get a ticket and hold sales and flights and figure out what to do with the kids and the spouse. Like it's the hardest thing we sell. Right. So for us, it's always like, like, and people always ask, how do you sell so many tickets to your vent? And I'm like, well, it's because we're selling them, you know, all the time to all sorts of stuff that the entire year trying to get excitement and noise. I remember, um, one of the, one of the dramatic demonstrations we decided to do was a telethon. Cause I was just thinking that one day I was just thinking that one. I remember back in the day, um, uh, watching telethons and like PBS was like, I remember one day I can't remember who I said to him, like we should have telethon and usually it's Dave would be like, we should totally do a telethon. And so like in this room that we're in right now, they set up tables and people would phone calls like phones back there and like, and Dave had the whole money suit on and we just jumped on and for, I don't know how many hours, we're like four hours. Yeah. It was like the Facebook lives and on the Facebook lives were like, call right now, call right now. We're doing this crazy prize and getting away stuff and just it was chaos. I think we sold, I don't know, a couple, like a hundred something tickets that day where we are normal day myself, three or four tickets, you know, and it's just this huge thing. And then it was over, but then I still get people today. Like, do you remember that telethon you guys did the one time and it was just a, a random, a random dramatic demonstration to try to recreate and like to get noise about an offer. Right. You always talk about this, like the goals, like you're creating a hook and the hook is that's what the dramatic demonstration is. Right. Do I explain people that is getting the lot of times they like the telethon wasn't fun or hacking live. It was a hook to get people interested so we could then sell them funnel hacking live. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, um, I think the dangers that some people look at a dramatic demonstration is the same thing as a watch. And it's like, they're not really the same thing. You're still launching. You're doing something to get attention, but the real key piece is this little offer hook part. My favorite way to explain it is back when I was a door to door sales guy and, uh, you know, for two summers, door door sales, I sold pest control and assault security. And I was also a telemarketer and, um, I did it cause I heard Kiyosaki wants saving colleges. Like if you're going to be an entrepreneur and you haven't learned how to sell, you're never going to be an entrepreneur. So I was like, make a hard coach, come up here to the toughest place. You know, door to door sales delivered. That sucked. But, you know, but I remember though that there was really, and anyone in sales knows there's, there's really two parts to the script and not talking marketing, literally just sales. You know, it's like when I go knock on the door and the opening was like, you know, what's up, Hey, I'm spraying the Jones's house down the street with the truck is here. Uh, that's half our cost. So we can do it for 50% off is four or five o'clock. Okay. For you today. And then we just went straight. Very sumptuous clothes. Yeah. Straight in, very sumptuous clothes. What time? And then, but the whole point though, and I mean, very rarely would someone go five o'clock and instead what it would do is smoke out their issues and we need to, you know, address them and get around. But the whole point though is that's really part one of the script. And we were not allowed. In fact, my sales trainer would ask me, did you get to the question? We were never allowed to go to part two of the script where we talk about the offer until we got them to ask one question, which is how much is it? Or tell me more. You know, and that key question right there allowed us to then present the offer. And, um, I think that's the danger. A lot of marketers have today. Is there assuming when they go to put out their marketing copy, they're assuming that people are already saying, tell me more. When really you haven't done part one, which is all the stuff that you're doing. Tell me more. How much is it? And marketers getting in trouble because they're like, raise your hand. Come on, get it up there. Yeah. Yeah. You want me to talk about my offer? Yeah. I'll raise that hand. Yeah. And then it's like offensive. It's not a, it's not a collaboration, you know, communication between the two. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. So how's that? Like, I'm trying to pitch that for people to make sure they understand. So like, yeah, give me an example of something you've done. Yeah. Um, specifically that breaking into back conversation from the offer and like separating those two things. Yeah. Yeah. I have one, uh, there was, uh, for you actually, the, remember the, um, the weight loss, uh, I think there's, so the scenario is this lady, right? The, you, you wanted to go put out, uh, products for and supplements for. She's like, Hey, um, I said, Hey, who's the dream customer? And she goes, I want to work with somebody who is trying to lose weights. They once felt like they were the pretty girl. Um, they want to go, you know, and get more, um, they want to feel better out themselves, be more confident. And they just feel like life has gotten in the way. And so what we had to do is we had to identify a story that wasn't sales material. You know, it was really getting someone to say, tell me more. And so this whole hook was like, Hey, you just looked at the last picture of you at a party and asked yourself, is that what I look like? You know, and you want, you've known what it's like to get a man's sneaking glance. How come you don't have that anymore? And now you have this diagnosis you kind of feel secret about. And now maybe a relationship didn't turn out the way you want to. And, um, you know, and then we basically said, what could you do to get revenge on all these things that have happened in your life only using your body? And we got get your revenge body.com, which is when the right person hears that they go, tell me more. And we're not, we're not, you know, we're not walking around. It's not a sales scripts. It's getting someone to just go, wait, what is hand raising? Is all you're really doing? So if you think about that, like for anyone watching or listening, it's like, look at everything you're doing in marketing today and ask yourself, does it get, does this get someone to raise their hand? Or am I already asking them for money and we're not even in a relationship yet? That's really a good way to figure out what you're doing. Yeah. How do we get their attention? How do we get them to stop? How do we get them to want more? Yeah. And create the, create the desire. It's interesting because like when I, I'm thinking about, it's funny. I'm obviously planning funnel hacking live. You know, if you're taking a shit, I'd go to funnelhackinglive.com. Yeah, crazy. But I'm also thinking like, like, what are campaigns we've done in the past? And so I was thinking, like, what's something that's hot right now? So two, two years ago, and NFTs were like the thing. It was like, oh, NFTs are so cool. So I was like, okay, we know this is a thing that people are talking about. Like, how do I, how do I, um, how do I use that as a hook to get, like, take something that I'm already interested in and throw my, my message out there to like hook upon it and use the, use the existing attention of what's happening. Right. So we did that. So we did this whole, it was like NFT, FHL.com or something and like, and I remember we took everyone who'd ever been to funnelhackinglive in the past and we had these like bank bags and put a sales letter to the big old NFT. I can't remember all the stuff on it and we shipped it to everyone who ever bought it to, so it's like 17,000 people have come to funnelhackinglive in the past. We send this thing in the mail, they got it, they were able to read through it. And then it was like, there's a live event coming. This is just for you guys, nobody else. And so, you know, 17,000 people had a private invite to this NFT event. And then we came on and we're talking about NFTs and why they're so cool. And like this year's FHL, Tom Billy's is coming to talk about NFTs, which is amazing to show you how you use NFTs inside your funnel. Um, on top of that, like, um, we're actually created NFTs for all of you guys who've been to funnelhackinglive. We made an NFT for each, each year. Right. So, and then it was cool as I used, I used this whole NFT angle to be able to sit there and like present to people. So it was crazy. We had a couple of thousand people on this presentation and they sat there for hours. I went through and I was like, okay, those are in 2015, how many guys are in 2015? I'm like, this is the NFT you get if you're here for 2015. I show it, I showed them the thing. And I was like, um, and like, let me show you this video. So I showed the sales video from 2015 FHL. So they saw that I came back and I was able to pitch, go get tickets. And I showed the 2017 one. And the same thing. It's like for two hours, they're watching these little video presentations about old events, they got an NFT for being there. So they got nostallz. I was like, I remember being there. I remember like I told the story about each event. And by the time it was done, you know, people sat there for like 90 minutes, me doing like story time with Russell and they're all like, people are crying. Like, I remember that event. I want to go back and all these people like re-bought tickets afterwards. But it was like, it was like creating this desire and the hook and like just something different to like get out there to like re-get their attention. Right? Yeah. Um, that's the hardest thing. I think nowadays is there's so much, I don't know, just like everyone's so busy and like attention is the key, right? Yeah. And it's the hardest thing to get. And we're competing not just against like the people in their life. You're competing against like some of the greatest people. We're competing against Joe Rogan, the UFC, NFL, NBA. Like everyone's fighting for the same eyeballs every second on each other's phones, right? Like that's who we're competing against. Everybody else was like, had you created something that's already got their interest in your grabbing those people and then bringing them back, bringing it back in. I was thinking, yeah. And just, okay, I was thinking about this a while ago. I was like, so what really, if attention is the goal and there's all these ways to get attention, like what really is the precursor, like the leading indicator to attention? And it's really noise. You know, like we look at that origin of sound and that's true. Even on a phone or whatever. Like, um, and you can make noise. I think the problem is that when people hear marketing and they hear the word noise, they think annoying, you know, but you can make positive noise. You can make things that people are excited about. Yeah. Music is right. And it reminds me of that. Do you remember when we did, um, a long time, you remember the, the 24 hour funnel build that we did? Yeah. Remember we built like four different companies funnels in one day. Cause I was like, I just watched like every 24 hours or it's the TV show 24. I'm like, we should do that. That was, that was a fun insane. Night. Do you remember Brett? So Brandon, you guys got to see me down the camera. He was there filming and editing like, like four a.m. So uncontrolled because he was so tired and we couldn't stop. I forgot about that. Remember that? A hundred percent. Let's do that again. But that's like, we should relaunch that episode, like just to show everybody that whole chaos that came from that. That should really fun. Well, I think that that's like the, I think where people sometimes and hear dramatic demonstration, they get a little bit hung up too, is they hear the word dramatic and they're like, I got to do the equivalent of bringing a celebrity from Europe. You know, I got to go and or whatever, but it couldn't just be doing what you do in a really unique way. Yeah. You know, just something for 24 hours. It's something interesting. Say, how do you do something that's yeah, doing, we just built finals 24 hours or. And then we went to the movie theater and launched the episode like a few. A few hours later. Remember that? Like go take a nap or they come back and watch it. So much fun. That's crazy. We did a lot of crazy stuff back in the day. Very good. Add some more like chaos back into back into our lives to civilize. Yeah. So interesting. Um, I was thinking about, um, another recent dramatic demonstration we did. And you know about this one, but, um, was with Dan Kennedy, right? Um, because again, me and you've been talking about so, so much. So every time we were having a new like offer, trying to launch my next question, like what's the dramatic demonstration? Like for my mind is thinking. So it's like, um, like what is something we create big to, again, get excitement and attention. And what's interesting, uh, those who last year's talking live, Tim Shields spoke, uh, on the late night session about, uh, dramatic demonstrations that he does dramatically, right? And when he's interesting, cause he, he was in his past, he would do courses, right? He had courses about photography and things like that from his house. And then he thought, what if I made this more exciting for people? And so, um, what he would do is he would go find a spot. So the very first one he did was this, the great, he went to the Grand Canyon. It's the side of the Grand Canyon. He did his live webinar there. It's the same webinar, nothing different. Other than he's like, I'm taking you guys to the side of the Grand Canyon. It's going to be amazing. And he brought Starlink out there and he felt, you know, he did the whole thing and he actually recorded a course out in the Grand Canyon. And then he did a webinar from there, uh, showing them the stuff and then like sold them the course. Um, and I, well, he's, he got the course free with the Sanford continuity program. So he's totally doing the MIFKI, you know, doing my, playing the playbook, but, uh, it was really, really cool. I had him share that everybody, but like, he said it, but it didn't really click. I was like, that's cool. I wish I was a photographer because I could do that. And he showed how he did it and like Banff, Canada and he does other places, like all over the world doing these cool things. But again, I don't know. I'm sure people at home are similar to me. Like, that sounds really cool. I wish I could do that. And I kept saying that, and then he joined, uh, the Atlas groups. Then like three weeks later, he's here on the stage in Boise. And he's shown the whole thing again. I was like, Oh, I wish I was a photographer. I could totally do something cool like that. And he said, she had something that got me a little closer to realizing by still didn't pay attention. He was like, he's like, the key is this. And so this is like for anyone to take a note. So he said, the key is this. He's like, you have to take your customers to a place that they wish they could go, but they would never go on their own. And I was like, ooh, that's so cool. Took a note still didn't, didn't drop. They didn't, didn't sit in my head and they looked at me directly. I was sitting right there. They looked at me and he's like, Russell, you know what I do? If I was you, I'm like, what? He's like, your people would love to go to Dan Kennedy's basement. They hear you always talk about it. If I was heard about, they can't go there. There's no internet there. He's like, you should bring a Starlink to Dan Kennedy's basement and go live from there. I was like, Oh, I had to be handing me on a silver platter before I got it. But then I got it. And hopefully like from that process, and he has like, we'll now get it. And I'm like, now on my head, I'm like, where else can I be doing these things? That right? I was like, we're supposed to go out to Wise Virginia, which is Napoleon Hill's home, and we're just going to go do a mastermind there. I'm like, I'm so stupid. Like I should be doing it from there. Like we last month, we were at, I'm in Chicago, Earl Nightingale's place, and we were in the archives and all the stuff. And I didn't, I didn't even think about it. Like I should have brought it there. Like it's just like, if you're doing something anyway, it's like, like whatever you're doing as a business owner, like bring them there. Right? Um, like what are you doing anyway? And like, and they let people experience that journey. That's part of like the intrigue. And that's part of it could be another way to look at a hook. You know, it's just a little bit differently. So Dan, we did that and we ended up by doing that wonder magic demonstration. We send it more people in the 15 minute window than we had in like eight months with paid ads through our traditional funnels. And she's like, the power of it's insane. It wasn't that hard. It was just like, we had to tell the story that the hooks got to be something interesting enough to be like, wow, I got, I got a, I got to register for that. I got to show it for it. You know, like a typical webinar, you get, you know, whatever people register in like 15% show up, right? For Dan Kennedy's basement, it was like, first off, we had way more registrants cause like there's over 10,000 registrants cause people are curious. Right. And then we had like 70% show up live. So it's just like, it shifts the whole dynamics. I'll be pitching in more people because you create something different than just like, I'm doing a webinar for my office today. You know, and now we can ever green that webinar show it for the rest of our lives. So, um, anyway, I really fun. I did. No, I think it's so cool. Cause I really think it's the antidote to like how the world has gotten. I mean, it's more ads have just gotten crazy. You know, and you actually said something at, uh, in a circle last week that was like, I thought really cool. It was like the final speech you gave the final day and you go, you said, yeah, in the past, like 10 years ago, these masterminds are all about ways we could do unique JVs together, but now we're all talking about ads 24 seven. How, how interesting is it that almost feel like the scale is tilting the other way. And to me, the concepts of dramatic demonstration is the antidote to how much ads world has gotten nuts. And there's kind of, I think there's a skill increase here that's going to be necessary for companies cause they're going to have to learn how to get attention without just rushing to pay ads. You know what I mean? Which now they get to go more creative and make some more attention, but it's actually easier, faster sales. If you do it right, then eight year eight months worth of ads, you know, I think it's easier too. Cause, um, I used to think creativity came in like making better ads. That's what we hire. We hire the Harman brothers like four times and they're amazing, insane. But each time it's like a half million dollars and then they can add campaign. Most people can do that. Instead it's like, uh, I'm going to go like whatever insert, whatever you do. I'm going to go take these guys to, you know, my high school gym where I grew up and I'm going to show them me shooting baskets in my high school gym or something like just something new or it's unique. We can tell a story behind it. That's like, that becomes, that becomes interesting and dramatic. Now, um, I also talked about, uh, the very first fun I can add when we talked, um, you, in fact, you, uh, you requested this to me. Like, I want you to show the campaign you did to actually sell the expert secrets books. Most people saw the funnel, like here's the funnel of how we launched expert secrets and they thought that's what it was. And it was fun preparing for that. Cause I was sort of going back in time and I was like, I can't believe how many little mini things we were doing all the way up leading to, to the big thing. I don't have a list of them all right now, but it was like, we were, we had dramatic demonstrations to our affiliates specifically and to our audience, the people who were like following us, like there were multiple things all coming together. The ads were dramatic demonstrations. There were so many fun things we did. Um, and I don't know, can you imagine? I tried to have my head a couple of the things we were doing. Um, totally. You know what's it's like, it was like 13 things that you did. All unique, different things. Yeah. They were crazy. You know, I think, I think we're going to show the event too. Like, so those who, if you have registered dramatic demonstrations.com, yeah, we're going to show that presentation. So you actually see like the screenshots and the videos of all the different things that are happening, which would be kind of fun. But anyway, and that's, I don't think people realize is like launching a book or launching a Harmon brother video or whatever. You know, it's, it's the same thing as launching a product, you know, and, and really a lot of times the precursor to it. But I mean, you remember this? I remember it was like two days before that book came out and you sent me a message and you go, dude, we should probably figure out how to put the funnel together because all the marketing energy was in promoting it. There was no funnel yet. Yeah. That was a little stressful. Last two days, right? Putting the caffeine more than I thought about that. But we focused more on dramatic demonstrations. Yeah. I'm missing. We did so many, like even after the launch happened, because you remember like we launched the book and then it was like, how do we keep momentum going? I remember Howard Berg, the world's fastest reader. Yeah. He had messaged me something. I was like, I have an idea. I'm like, Hey, can I fly you to Boise and I want you to read my entire book and we'll tie me off as you can read it. And then I'm going to drill you on questions. And that became just a dramatic demonstration. Like the world's fastest readers here in Boise. I gave him the books where he read it. I think he read the whole book in like four minutes or blown away something crazy. And I was like drilling them on questions and he knew all the answers. And it was like, like, what's the point of that? Nothing, except for to get people excited and like make, like intrigue and interesting, like make it, you know what I mean? And it was like. Or like when you sent the book to everybody and they thought they got the real book, but there was nothing in it. There was thousands of people. Yeah. The book was so the book wasn't finished yet. So I was like, how do I get affiliates to be interested about this book? Yeah. So we printed out blank copies and people texted me like, bro, this book is so good. And I was like, there's nothing in it. It's all blank page. I've just said to you something to like, let you know a book is coming. Get excited about the whole campaign. Um, yeah. But it's like thinking through like all the different things that were the things we can be doing. You, I forgot you mentioned the Harman Brothers video. Like we launched the video and it wasn't just like, okay, the video is going live on YouTube. It's like, like what could we do to make this special and how can we people talking about how can get the right people talking about it? Like, well, if we want to get influencers to share and promote it, how do we get those people there? Like, well, we have to throw a party. And so it went from throwing a party to throwing a party at boys' state football stadiums. Like, what if we like did a bubble soccer game? They find like, well, if I said again, it's like a world records. You know, I like it, it got chaotic. So sometimes. So, you know, this is not a good example of how to like do small ones, but it's a good example of big ones. But how do you make it more fun and more exciting? And, you know, to launch YouTube video, we had, I can't remember three or 400 people in the event. Gary V came in, like all these influencers, like, and everyone together, like talked about and pushed and promote this video and that helped it to go, to go viral. I think it's such a key thing to understand too. I think that's actually one of the biggest people things people struggle with when they think dramatic demonstrations. They don't realize like, like when you're a entrepreneur, that mentality affords to have to think like minimum viable product, you know, what's the fastest thing I can do to get it out the door as quick as possible. But like marketers have a totally different mentality where it's like, what's the loudest thing I can do? How can I make the most of it? There's no such thing as minimum viable really with marketers. It's like, I'm going to go big. I'm going to throttle hard. And that doesn't mean complicated or chaotic, but loud, you know, getting that attention. I, my favorite part of that bubble soccer thing was when you made the list of dream 400 YouTubers and we, the script was that you had to act like you were getting out of the car for each one. And I remember looking at you out the window and you got out of the, what's up? This is Russell Brunson. I'm just got this cool thing coming up. I want to invite you to, and you're like getting out of the car. You got the car faked 400 times and I'm building 400 pages of the car. It was like every every influence was like, Hey, what's going on, dude? Perfect. So excited to see, like, yeah, like over. Yeah. I think the reason why I've been successful a lot of times, cause I'm only do what most people are not willing to do. You know what I mean? That it was hours and hours and be doing that. In fact, it's funny cause I think back about, man, this is pretty click-filmed, pretty anything anyone would even remember, but my brother just started with my video guy. We didn't have a video. We had just a camcorder that you could film video clips or a no camera. A photo camera. You could take videos on as well. And so same thing I was doing a joint venture or trying to launch with the JV partners. And so I had my brother stand there and film me do like 300 videos talking each person. What's funny about it is again, this is, it's a little handheld camera, but we didn't have a tripod or anything. And so this is like his first day working for me. So he's standing there holding this camera, like, stop, stop, stop, stop, start, stop. And like, I remember like after like 30 minutes, he's like, my back's hurting, my shoulders. I was like, sorry, man, like we can't stop. Like we have to keep going. And so for hours, he's filming these things. And I feel so like looking back at Scott, if you're watching, thank you again for sacrificing your body for this thing. But it was like four hours of that. Like after a while, we're like, we're setting up books. They put his hands on the books to like hold it steady, you know? But it was like, yeah, like I need everyone to, I need to make enough noise. Like, you know, people aren't going to listen to like a mass email to 400 people except be a specific video specific for every single person. Save me a watch, click, as the exact same thing. We made those video cards and I made a video for every single joint mentor partner specifically for every single one of those things. I'm proud of that. Yeah. It's just a mentality. I think it's the peace people just struggle with. This is just, they don't realize it's like, it's a different mentality than entrepreneur, not, you know, and they, and they work together, but one's kind of like the builder, one's the noise creator, and they're just so unique. You know, one's like, well, I can just go do this in a cave. I'm going to build my offer. I'm going to sit in the cave. And I don't think you should do that, but you can build a whole product in isolation. But you really can't do it as a marketer. And it's a total, I don't, it's stupid, but sometimes I'll like take a hat off and put another hat on. I'm like, okay, I got to change mentality. Otherwise I let the entrepreneur mentality start to drive the marketing seat. And that's when it gets dangerous because I'm like doing minimum viable copy, minimum viable noise, minimum viable, and it just doesn't work that way. That reminds me, as you said that, so this is a good example. So my book, I'm writing a book, I'm going to write it in five years. So who knows if it'll come out, but check this out. So let me pull up here on Instagram. So I realized I was like, if I'm going to do this book, like I need to make more noise and talk about it more often, right? But also it's like, if I can take my audience on the journey with me, like they'll be more likely when the book is done, don't want to buy it. Instead of me like, I wrote a book to like, here it is. Like if they're like, they know nothing about the backstreet, the pain, the anger, the anxiety, the stress, the like, the fact I'm bleeding for my fingers to type this book, right? So I decided to start documenting this journey to start filming it. And so I shared this inner circle. So you've seen it, but this is fascinating. So, so I started this series on Instagram. So if I'm on Instagram, you can go see it. And so I started in the very first one. So video one says day number one of writing a new book and hopefully selling a million copies. So very first one I posted, I got 43,000 views, which is not bad for a real like, not great, but I feel me is like, this is, this is good. It's great. Um, and then episode number two I posted. So day two on writing a new book, selling a million copies of 42,000 views. So about the same little less, but starts getting momentum then day number three. Um, selling, writing a best selling books, selling copies, 30,000 views. It's still not quite there, but then it starts getting a little more traction day for, uh, 25,000 views in the day five, uh, 49,000 are growing. Then day number six, 192,000 day number seven, 594,000. So I'm seven days into this. This is me sharing the thing in the direct demonstration. It's like slowly, slowly, slowly starts picking up speed. So day seven, 594,000 people watch this video. Um, day number eight will launch, I think on Monday. So we went once week, we're launching these little, this little series. I think about this now. It's going to take me a year to write this book. So in a year from now, I'm going to have like, you know, it's maybe a hundred of these little episodes. I don't know if this trajectory will continue to go, but imagine like, I'm, I'm doing this little mini like it's a 60 second dramatic demonstration, right? Just, here's my book. Here's the chaos. Here's the stress. Here's the thing I'm learning. Here's like, whatever it's like a year from now, imagine if these videos are getting, I don't know, 3 million, 5 million, 10 million views. And then my book comes out. There's 10 million people who every single day for a year, but anxiously anticipating the launch of this book that's eventually going to come. And that's like, Hey, my book's ready. Like boom, New York times, best selling in five seconds. Cause, cause I've been doing this journey long, right? And I think that for anybody, like instead of building your offers or your funnel or your course or your coaching for anything in isolation, start sharing the journey. Like this is what I'm doing. This is why I'm doing this. How, and just like start taking people on that journey. And then when, when you get to the finish line, now you have the noise and the audience and all kinds of stuff versus like, okay, the book's done. How should I sell this? I get people come to me like, Hey, I just created my course. I killed myself. It's done. What should I do? And I was like, you missed it. Build the audience first. Like that's the, like that's the key. It's been, it's been actually interesting. Um, as you know, my obsession now is like, how do I get traffic that's not like non-zuckerberg traffic. Yeah. Not a non-zuckerberg, not why I have to pay him. Right. Yeah. And so I've been doing a lot of interviews on the podcast talking specifically to people about that. And when someone talked about, uh, Facebook groups and their whole queue was like, how simple it was to have cheap ones grow Facebook groups. I was like, think about this. If you're going to start a new offer, create a Facebook group and just start organically growing and dropping, same day, dropping, here's what I'm doing. Here's what I'm doing. Who's doing it? And all of a sudden, like in a month or nine days from now, you have an audience of 500,000, 2000 people for almost no cost in this group now who are, who are part of this process of audience to sell to you. Right. Or whatever the thing might be, it's just like, yeah, start that, the, the noise, like the creation of noise early so that when you're ready to make a lot of noise, like, like that, you know, the level of, I don't know how to explain this. Yeah. I'm like, it's waiting for you instead of you. Like, dude, Barnum did the same. That's one of the biggest lessons I learned going through all these campaigns was he's like, a lot of what if internet business owners will do is they'll be like, I finished my product yesterday. Therefore today I'm going to launch it. And it's like, ah, darn it. You know, they start emailing their list or they start posting. They start immediately approaching the traffic that they can control. But what Barnum did is he never talked to traffic. He can like reach until step four. Like the first thing he always did was he'd always get credibility for the offer and involve another influencer. Always. Like, and I think it's a big key piece to it is like every single time he would go involve another influencer and then always involve the audience in the launch. You know what I mean? Like he would never ever launched in isolation. He launched with the audience, but always like, it's like a little carrot thing. Can't have it yet. Can't have it yet. Can't have it yet. It reminds me of, um, interesting, dude, you remember, uh, it's like eight years ago. I was about to leave working for you. I was sad. And eight years ago. Is that crazy? I left almost eight years ago. I'm ahead of my life. Like 18 months ago. I know. It feels like it was last week, right? Um, that's crazy. Nuts, right? A lot of times go by. But like, uh, the last project we ever did together was for software secrets. Do you remember that? I didn't know we were doing anything for them. And so three months before that, I was looking at different podcasts on software and I started listening to this podcast called software secrets. It was like, oh, sweet. And for three months, I mean, every time I mow the lawn or like fold clothes or whatever, lift anything, I would be listening to this podcast and they're like, are we at a crazy thing for you today? We're building our software and we're just documenting what's happening to us. We had a coder hold this hostage and we had the, you know, and they're telling this backstory and then the next episode, they're like, and I'm binging it. Cause I feel like I have to catch up now and they're documenting them. Building the software. And there's this little feature. I remember in the top left, this one little feature was right there in the corner. And they're like, there were three, four episodes about how hard it was to get that little feature. And I remember I got to the very end of that show mad that it wasn't live yet. Cause I was totally sold and ready to go by. And then I remember walked in and looked at your board and we were building. I was like, this is them. Are you kidding me? And I was like the first guy to buy. They're building all the anticipation before. Yeah. Yeah. He include the audience in the launch. Yeah. Yeah. Just like Hollywood. It's so interesting that like, I feel like we all, the market got lazy. Yeah. A little bit. Literally because of Facebook ads. Yeah. Cause like, all right, just flip a switch and people will show up and it's like, that's getting harder and harder and more and more expensive and again, more and more noise. It's like, man, the people who can, who can engineer the stuff correctly at a time. Yeah. Uh, it's the, it's the key. And I started thinking about this. Like, um, I was out visiting Andy LA yesterday. I think I told you and I look at what their company's doing. And it's like they're, they're posting two YouTube videos a day, five reels a day, all this kind of stuff, but they're not just like them, like sitting behind a desk. Like, let me tell you three tips. So what, you know, it's like, it's very, it's very like these little mini dramatic dims, little things they're doing to like get attention to get you engaged, get you like, like, I want, like whatever that feeling I'm seeing, I want that. I need to feel that. I want to feel that. You know what I mean? That's what they're just driving with over and over and over again. It's like, yeah, if we start looking at everything we're doing as, as producers, as content developers, whatever you want to call yourself, a creator. Um, it's just looking at like, how do we change this from scripted things to like experiences we're giving people? You know what I mean? Like, yeah, we're an experienced age. Like, um, like somebody asked me the other day that I, that like, you know, information used to be the thing. You know, like, in fact, when we bought Dan Kennedy's company, it was fascinating cause they gave me like the newsletter they ran every, every month for like 20 years, they also had a CD the month club and the people paying an additional $97 to get a CD each month with an interview on it. And like that was worth $97 a month back in the day, which is, that's a podcast interview now, right? There's no value in that anymore. And like courses used to be better, but like, and, um, and they asked me like, what's, what's the difference? Like if information is now free, like what's the net? It was the information age. What's the next thing? And I thought about, I think that there's two things. One is like, I think implementations where money is that help implement the ideas. But number two is education and entertainment and like getting people involved. So it's like, if you stop looking at what you're doing is like, as anything else, like I'm trying to educate my audience. Like no, no, no, no, no, no, you're trying to entertain your audience. Like that's why they stick. That's why they pay attention. That's why they get on board. That's how they fall in love. You, that's when they show up. That's when they buy your stuff. And, um, the people that are, that are winning today at the highest level in our markets that I, that I studied, I geek out on. It's the, it's those who are, who are using this entertainment, engaging the audience. And that's the audience that I sucked into it. You know, so it's like thinking about it through that lens. And that's why P.T. Barnum, little P.T. here, by the way, they call him the gray showman, right? That's the thought like, how do you go in the gray showman in your market where you're, it's not just running ads. I can just put a billboard telling people that the circus is in town. It would not have happened. Right. Um, it's, it's him creating these things that, that make it bigger. I think that if we can all just look at through that lens a little differently. Um, we're doing the same work. It's just how you are the frame your mind is going to, as you're doing those things, that's, that's what makes a dramatic demonstration powerful. You know what I mean? Did you ever read a book called, um, by Daniel Pink called, I think it's whole new mind or something like that. It's a, it's one of my design classes in college. They had us read it and I've never forgotten his claim. His claim was that in the near future, because of tech and all this automation, so much of the left brain activities of our life will be automated. Therefore the future belongs solely to the right brain thinkers. Isn't that interesting? Wow. The more creative people are really the ones who own the future because all of the rest of it is going to be analog, automated, but AI can't be, at least as as now it's not creative, right? AI is, is. You still have to be the input. You know what I mean? And so like, I think that's what's powerful about it is like, okay, AI and all this stuff is so powerful, but you know, I was, I was trying to explain to someone, actually I had my own podcast was like, Hey, like I love AI. It's, it's really powerful. It's a, it's a step in the creative process, but never has the final say in it. However, you know, if I go ask like chat, GBT, Hey, what are the 10 steps to start a business? It'll load like 10 steps out, but what it can't do is give me personal experience. By the way, watch out for step three. That one's a beast. When I executed it was, you know, so I think there's going to be, that's where it sits in. And I think it's where it overlaps with dramatic demonstrations is like, come with me while I show you my creative process because the rest of the stuff is the value of it's dropped. Yeah. Yeah. So fascinating. All right. I want to talk about what we're doing. We have some cool stuff coming up. The long-term goal was, was not here yet. We're, we're making a book about dramatic demonstrations, which is going to be amazing, right? Like, and you've seen the cover design. It looks so cool. Yeah. I'm, I'm excited for that, that book and everything about him to, but to do a book. And those of you may not know this, like, uh, I've written three books working on book number four right now, book number one, I wrote the book, hated it, deleted it through a three day event, taught the book. People went crazy. I moved from that to make some shifts and then wrote the book and then came, became.com secrets expert secrets. I wrote the book, hated it, deleted it through a three day event, did the whole thing and then came back and then that became the book traffic secrets. Ah, I learned this time through the event and then I wrote the book much simpler process. I probably needed my secrets of success event. Maybe that's what I, I anyway, it might be. Yeah. Maybe that's the thing I'm missing, but, um, first of all, that's the plan. We're writing this book. We're going to do a three day event before the three day event. Cause it obviously isn't going to be fun. It's going to be in your office. I'm excited to do a full event there, which would be cool. Yeah. And everyone should come to that. Um, but prior to that, obviously we want to provide value first. So we're doing, um, I don't even know a mini, we're doing our own dramatic demonstration to talk about dramatic demonstrations, getting to come to the back, dramatic demonstration events. You buy the magic demonstration book eventually, but first one's coming up. And I don't know that by the time this podcast drops, it's probably in a week or two or, you know, probably have coming really soon. And maybe it may already happen and hopefully the replays are there. There's a free event coming up. Do I talk about kind of what is going to be happening on that event and why they should go register for free at dramatic demonstrations.com. Yeah. Yeah. Um, honestly, like, yeah, I think this is a cool thing too, that you've really been teaching everybody about also is you can. Go use things of the past, you know, to go be dramatic about it. So yeah, we're doing a three day events. It's all about, um, well, actually the first is the three hour. I'm getting to mix that three hours free. Three hours. It's a free one. Yeah. Yeah. And we're going to go through and teach out of kind of a high level, really, what all the dramatic demonstration, what it is. And then the next part is like really the copy. Like that's really where I think people get it messed up is again, they're acting like a salesperson when they should be marketer or they're acting like an entrepreneur when they should be acting like a marketer. And so it teaches those. And, uh, just like we teach those, the ramp up process to the next thing. And then the next thing, and then the next thing. Yeah. It's been cool. And I think, uh, for those who were at funnel hacking live, they saw our presentations. Like we're actually going to be showing those again for free, which is cool. So that'll give you guys the context. The very first year we talked about, it was very deep until like, like launch extra secrets book and show all that stuff. We talked about those kinds of things and a bunch of other things, which was really cool. And, uh, for me, that was probably my favorite presentation I've given on stage. Like, I can't, I'm off stage. That was so much fun. I was like, it was amazing. That was number one. And you're number two, we switched more into the copy side of things. And so they're going to have a chance to watch both those presentations for free during this live event, which would be cool. Um, the second one, like you said, we go more into copy and there's a phrase that you use, which I, I think you know that with the phrase one, like, yeah, what's it called? It's called the offer hook. The offer. So you're going to learn about offer hook, which is cool, which is, um, there's something you knew you brought to my thought and my, and you know, for a couple of my businesses now, we were talking about potentially even doing it today. We were out of time, but doing it today for one of my, my projects and working on, but it's a really cool process. And those who were coming to live, and you're actually going to be doing it for them as one on one offer. One on one. Yeah. One on one. He'll build out your offer for you, which that's worth 20 grand just by itself. Um, you learn about that during the free event as well. So both things happen. The free events are going to be amazing. You're just going to go watch it and then here's the, here's the behind the scenes. We're going to pitch you to come to the three event at the end of it. That's it. So either way, they get value and they should come to three event because the event will be amazing. It's going to be really small groups. There's not going to be a ton of people that are just going to be you with the really small group of people going through it. Um, and then the fact that you're building people's offer hooks is worth buying and take it just for that. It's a lot of work, but I love doing it. It's always like, it feels like a jigsaw puzzle. And like, ah, this is why you have, don't have leads anymore. Yeah. It's really fascinating watching you do the process to you done for me twice. Um, and just watching the way your brain goes. Cause for me, it's like, first I'm like, why is he asking me these questions? This is still on the, you know, all of a sudden like your pop up like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, what the, where did you pull that from? That is amazing. You're going to be teaching that how you do that framework, but I'm sure it's a hard thing to teach. So the fact that they're going to have a chance of three days to learn it, but then have you just do it for him is like, is, is going to be special. So I'm excited for that. So, um, yeah, I'm, I think what else we need to, we need to cover. Dramatic demonstrations are fun though. It's like the thing that's number one in my mind right now is every campaign, every offer, every everything. I'm just like, how do we, what are all the, the, the big, you know, for me, it's like a webinar could be dramatic administration, a challenge could be dramatic, dramatic demonstration, but videos are ads are like, so for me, it's like, what are all the different things we're doing out there to really create the noise to get people to buy the offer we actually want them to do. And so like, I'm glad that we coined this phrase because at least for me personally now it's like that whole thing is like, what are the dramatic demonstrations around this? Like, yes, we got tons. Like let's start throwing out the ideas and then that's when that's all the fun. We channel our inner mini PT Barnum. Yeah. You know, to be able to do that. So yeah, you know, the, um, you remember, remember there's a while ago, you talked about, uh, you know, the who, not the how kind of a thing. I think we're about to go through that as a market because, um, the more I've talked about dramatic demonstrations, it's been interesting to see who, who is like drawn to it versus who's like, huh. And I think if people, you know, they watch a listen and like, I don't know that I'm really the person that go do that. That's okay. You don't find the who that is that's psyched about that. And I think there's going to be more of the, the true marketers to raise their hands coming up, you know, and like, I love that stuff. Now that'll be fun. For sure. You gotta become a student this game to be, yeah, it's the amazing thing. I've learned last 20 years is like those who become obsessed with the marketing of their thing do way better than those who obsessed with the thing. You know, so be obsessed with both, be obsessed with your product, the thing, but it'd be more obsessed about the marketing because that's, if you really love the thing you're trying to sell, uh, you should be obsessed with the marketing of it because that's like, that's the fulfillment of the thing you, you've created, right? Like without, without that, like there's no point in it. Like, you know, you create something no knows about it. Then what's the point of you even creating it? Like, why did you do it? And if you really love the thing you create, like you gotta become obsessed with the marketing of it because that's when you get to share the gift. And that's when that's all the, like all the benefits of creation come. You get to see it work on the people. You see it change your life. You see like them, how they are, ha, as you know. Um, and remember listening to Ryan Holiday and he talked about how, uh, writing a book is such, it's like such a private thing, right? Same with creating an offer or whatever. It's like private in your head, but then like just sharing it was very public, which is why a lot of people get scared. Um, for me, I remember writing the doc on Seekers book. I, I, I killed myself. Like that was my first, like my mind, the first real art I'd created. You know, I'd done other stuff, courses, stuff that was like, this was art for me. And it was like, and it was so personal. I was so scared to share it with people. In fact, I'm right. I sent copies of bunch of my friends. There's one friend who I, it's rich shepherd. He's like one of the most voracious readers I've ever met. And I was like, so scared for him to get it. Cause I mean, this is my art. I don't want to share it. And then we're at T and C and he came to me and he's like, dude, all these people said they got your book. I can just send it to me. I'm like, Oh, cause I'm scared of you. You're the one who could like destroy my soul in like one, like negative review. And I had one there and he's like, can I take it on the flight with me home? I was like, ah, yeah, man. So he took it and I was just like, what if he hates it? Like then, and it was crazy. He read the whole flight home and he finished it on the flight and he texted me. He's like, bro, this is good. This is really good. I was like, oh, you know, I think that's the, the, the, the thing is the most who are so scared of like, what if my thing's not good? But it's like, man, like, but then when I got that feedback, like this is good. There was like, oh, like so validating. Then I was like, I want to tell everybody in the world about it. You know what I mean? That's how I feel about this book. Like you're the rich chef and I'm like, oh my gosh, this better be good. I know it's going to be a good book, but I'm like, man, like, what if it sucks? You know, well, for sure. Oh man, I definitely feel that pressure with it. It's going to be so fun though. I'm excited, man. It'll be great. You've, I mean, I know what was watching you iterate on these frameworks and stuff for the last two years or so has been really cool to see. And I think labor love spot now where it's like, it's simple and, and, and replicatable where people can actually use it. And I think that's the exciting thing. So yeah. Yeah. And I think it'll be fun because we can share a bunch of stories from old dead people. I'm going to bring some of my, my favorite scenes as well. Like some of my favorite marketers are just watching what they've done. You know, reading what they did in the past is really, really cool. And then I'm going to bring a lot of case studies to the bed of just like what people are doing right now. I've been watching. I've been last two years, my eyes wide open watching everybody. So it's like, you know, I'll bring my swipe file. Cool things people can look at and you can model into your business as well. So it's going to be awesome. I am pumped for the event.
