I You guys believe it's like been another year since last year and we're here again This is year number five. How many of this is your first time coming to this? Oh dang sweet. Well, welcome to the party I look at you or a camera where you can look at me, right? Okay So how did the event go? The event turned out amazing. I think overall I was really nervous ahead of time that nobody was gonna show up But when we opened the doors it was it was packed and we filled the whole room. It was awesome Ladies and gentlemen this next individual I'd like to introduce is the reason that we are all here this weekend About eight months ago. He brought to the marketplace something that we all desperately needed The ability to make professional looking sales funnels in a matter of hours as opposed to months Click funnels has had over seven thousand members active members and Over 200 people are joining every single day Wow is right and you know who is right exactly you don't get that You don't get to experience that you don't get to have that if the product that you've created Isn't awesome Isn't what the marketplace needs So speaking of awesome ladies and gentlemen, here's what I'd like you to do Go ahead and stand up for me and welcome to the stage. Mr. Russell I Have me is a process that I was doing ever since I first got started I didn't we didn't have a name for it. We never called it that but basically I wasn't like a Amazing business person or that creative or anything So I was just looking what everybody else was doing to make money when I first got started I saw people like arm and more and I saw they didn't so I just modeled that like as close as I could because it was working The the true story is that I I was wrestling I just met my my wife We were engaged and I had to figure out a way to pay the bills So the logical choice for me was look online to figure out how to make money right? This is 12 years ago And I started looking around I started seeing all these people who were super smart making a bunch of money like I was watching these Guys create these products and they were selling them. I remember like their sales letters were so good I bought every single one of them and I started seeing all their processes And so I went and I hired this dude from from Romania and he built my first idea was this little product called zip brander And then I looked at Armin's websites and he always had these little covers And so I hired some make a little cover and then he had a headline So I wrote a headline and then in his head or you always had a picture of him in a suit and tie So I went got a picture me in a suit and tie But I just made it look as close to his as possible because like he was the dude who's making a bunch of money I was watching right and because I had followed his process it started making money Eventually I went from this college kid who wasn't you know didn't have a job Not that educated just trying to wrestle to within a year of graduate from college I made over a million dollars in sales and it wasn't for me being a genius of business It was me looking at people were successful in modeling them. That's kind of how I got started To understand like where fun hiking live came from you have to go back in time I remember I was going to school. I was making money by my senior year I made like two hundred fifty thousand dollars online like selling stuff and I remember my mom like being so nervous like what's your plan What's your job? What are you gonna do? I'm like making money online. I know but like when that's done Like what's your plan? Like what's your backup plan? Like, you know, that was the big the big thing in fact I remember Back then it wasn't many people went online to consume stuff to get knowledge information Like it was still like the school system is traditional as a way nowadays 15 years later You see where most people it's like you want to learn something, you know go to school It's like who created the course who's the person wrote the book on school directly the feet of the master, right? That's what how we kind of look at education today, but it wasn't like that back then weird Like I remember the first time I saw an e-book like it didn't make any sense to me And then first I try to sell the book people messaged me like like where's where's the book? I'm like it was an e-book. I don't understand what that means like means you download it Like why did I pay you then? I'm like because the words on the page are my like and people couldn't even grasp us before Amazon had Ebooks right it's like physical books were the thing and digital stuff like it took this learning curve people understand like why would I pay for something? That's that's not I can't touch you know what I mean I Wasn't the first person that tried to build click funnels or a click funnel. So in fact my first one is called click calm calm I had six programmers spend three years on it and it never saw the light of day That's when I met Todd Dickerson. He's like no, I think I can do it I was like alright man. Well good luck with that like if you really want to spend the next year of your life trying to do Like like that'd be awesome, and I knew Todd was good I know how how amazing was but he literally like took some of the sketches and the diagrams and ideas we had and he locked himself In his bedroom and his closet wherever he was that and in like six months he built the very first version of click funnels We didn't know what click phones gonna become we thought it was gonna be something awesome But we made we still made most of our money doing the information when we launched click funnels Initially launched this thing and it was interesting because the software without the information didn't actually do anything we launched it And it was like hitting a brick wall It was like crickets like nobody got it. Nobody understood. It was just the weirdest thing I'm like people that know what we created for my if I could see with them just explain like this is why this is so important Like it would change everything But like it just couldn't get traction about the same time I'd started my very first book which is dot com secrets And I was like I'm gonna get this book done because people read the book almost like a manual like here's the strategy I had how this thing works and it was crazy how the book launched people got the book they read it and also they're like Oh, that's why I need a funnel. That's why this is so important It's I'm like I know and so we had now like this book which was like the training manual to help you strategically understand Then the tool that let you easily do it and so they had the book and the software together That's when it started taking off people read that they're like, okay I get it and then maybe the software would actually execute on it. I Wish I could say this is all strategically designed to be getting but it wasn't and it's funny is that our cute the little community We had at the time it was Facebook group probably had two or three thousand people at this time They started calling themselves funnel hackers like they started using that as a term like people coming like hey My fellow funnel hackers I got a question for you and like they kept saying that I was like this is cool Like they've they've got a name for themselves And they'd heard me and Todd talk about these little hackathons We used to do like we used to do all my hackathons to get stuff done I'm like, yeah, let's do a hackathon and so we get these little groups around the country people do in like two and three person meet up hackathons That's like hey, this is so cool Like this is happening without us trying to engineer this thing and they're doing their own little events things happening And it's like we can just let them keep doing it or like what if we facilitated that people just kept asking keep asking me Finally, I was like, all right. Let's let's go for this. Let's do the men It's like what we call the men you know our people are funnel hackers that like we're gonna funnel hack live together And then that was the name I was like that's that's it. It's fun. I can lie. Let's just call it that It was awesome, so I appreciate you guys I remember my first seminar of which I was dreamed about doing seminars We tried for a bunch of years. Let me gave up a sword Brent and John that we would never do another seminar again I'm grateful we did and just grateful for you guys for executing and making it making it all happen So thank you and it's amazing. So thanks you guys I'm kind of behind the scenes So I was the technical co-founder when we started ClickFunnels Brussels the marketing sell side of the company the coaching and the events Well, I'm the guy running the actual software business and running everything behind the scenes When started ClickFunnels with Brussels just me and him so I was working out of the basement basically So we grew a little bit and we decided to expand and get an actual office get out of my wife's hair at the house all day every day All right, so we're gonna re quantum physics I Tick tick tick tick tick tick more you that was more user signing up on Or going down one or the other. Hopefully it's not down So funnel hacking live started as the ClickFunnels user conference, I guess you would say but it's really grown to something much bigger now Big differences between the different types of events that I've been to at least so you've got user conferences Which tend to be more technical hands-on this is how you can use this software in this industry to accomplish this goal Those events kind of tend to be boring usually like you end up seeing a lot of people just networking in the hallway Personal development in internet marketing conferences are kind of the other side of the equation that we see a lot of like getting excited about methods and stuff But there's not really like hands-on training necessarily oftentimes There's people selling courses to learn more and that kind of thing whereas I think we've taken kind of the best of both worlds and mesh them together for funnel hacking live where we've taken and we do hands-on stuff We teach you usable real-world things that you can do right now with our software and with our products to actually grow and progress your business But we also come in with the motivation and excitement and the culture and the community around you Repeat after me We're ready for you to show us What's new with click funnels My name is Melanie new bin I am Russell's executive assistant and I plan all of our events. I don't have a title for that, but I pretend it's director of events Sent they took black red and blue markers There's fatties and small like regular so I'll grab mine and bring mine as a backup to be safe So when I started working for Russell, I didn't get a job description I just came in and did what I thought he needed help with and then a month later I was asked to plan the rest of their funnel hacking live event for San Diego and just keep teasing people about that From San Diego on to where are we Nashville? This is the hardest part for sure getting concepts out but now it's like brute force of like getting into a thing So like mentally I would say I'm probably 90% done physically or probably like 20% It works out all the time. No Russell getting his presentations done is the most stressful for me Because I like to make sure he has that time blocked out But he usually works on them a week or two before the event So it's fresh in his mind and I understand that like the first year I did this event I died we're out of whiteboarder my board whiteboard whiteboard these are all maxed out We got you know our doodle space. We got doodle space. It's gone here My desk is the nightmare everything's clumped up Thank you 80,000 tabs open and none of my six presentations are done all of them are partially done None of them even close to done and we are six days away today the event starts a week from today But the good news is apparently there's another whiteboard All right, it's all done What's a million so we just plan the whole man and there's some big changes you're probably gonna kill me but All right with that said one thing before we get too deep on this we're pretty deep so it's happening On Wednesday, she told her not That was me Oh Man you are the coolest. I'm so sorry. All right, okay So what we're thinking is to get everything done we want to do I love this part of my job too It takes me away from just like the everyday life of being an assistant and this is kind of brings some like Razzle dazzle to it The only way to keep organized for me that I know that I'm fully responsible for is in here all of our team members I list them out. I take all their names their job title I figure out what their event role is and then who they report to at the event and then what their role is for day one through Four these are some of the items that we were responsible for shipping out So like pins and chapsticks and hand sanitizer staff shirts renewal shirts action XMD shirts our event guide our wrist bands Our backpacks like everything you think of that has our logo on it or has something to do with the event That is a print job and our design team is doing that So that's why I like to try and get that stuff started earlier versus later I don't think if we didn't have these spreadsheets We would die like every week for hotel reservations You have to go through make sure the hotel has the right check-in dates check-out dates name and the type of room So I just want to go through a few like last-minute things for funnel hiking life Mm-hmm, his says the 18 and we need to update that so it shows the 17th, okay? Because I think they're meeting us. Yeah, yeah, that'd be awesome Send me like who he's bringing with them. So I don't know if it's like a wife and kid and you know what I mean So I'm waiting to hear back. That's the only outstanding one I have right now. It's all gonna work out. It always does I'm just getting a little nervous. Yeah Just let me know what I can do to help Unless you can sew shirts and make sure Last minute my name is Miles Clifford and I am the events manager at quick funnels So after last year's funnel hacking live, I took over the events team So it's taking you know Russell's idea and his concepts and Dave and the other partners there What their vision is for funnel hacking live and executing on that vision? So whether that's food and beverages to the hotel rooms to the staging the lighting the Experiences that people have at the hotel during the event off the event. That's what the events team does We're gonna turn left What really helped with this event was the going and seeing the site Melanie a couple other team members came down here did a site visit when you don't do that You're going in blind and you never want to go into an event blind That's like the biggest thing because they don't let us do t-shirt guns when there's chandeliers so Russell's in trouble right now Melanie is grounding him because the work I don't want to get this It's like the little temper tantrum from our Russell Brunson over here What do you have to do six presentations? Oh Russell? What do you have to do last Monday at the same time six presentations? Russell how many you done? None, but give yourself credit. What'd you get done? The title slides? They look pretty That makes me feel happy and good Most people go out and they just pay for a lot of speakers to randomly come in for us What we really want is we want part of our community people who've had success and who are doing things in a unique way that Would be of great value to the rest of the audience That really helped them get whatever that next step might be for them But also we want to make sure that basically lines with us in the direction that we're trying to go with the event as well Hey Stacy, I was so impressed with what you and Paul presented at our inner circle and Russell I were talking about you know It'd be awesome if you could actually present the same type of thing to our funnel hacking community If you could kind of talk about some of the cool stuff you guys do from a relationship transformation standpoint But then also really dig in deep as far as how do you actually connect with your audience? Boxing back. Let me know if that works for you guys and look forward to having you guys at funnel hacking live. Thanks My name is Dave Woodward. I run all of our top line revenue for ClickFunnels all of our business development opportunities integrations partnerships my whole job is just to make money for ClickFunnels So So Russell would cast the vision Overall as far as what's the event going to be focused on and with that There's certain people that we try to line up that will be specific to that and then I have the opportunity of reaching out to a Lot of those people and signing the contracts getting them on board and really developing those relationships that help us not only just for the event But long term as well Hey Steve, all right, but got a huge favor for you If you don't mind I'm sure you won't but we'd love to have you speak at fun I can as I take a look at building a speaking team for an event You can definitely bring in big people and have their name and everything else and it helps for some credibility But there's no greater social proof than people are using your product who are having success doing what you've been preaching in their own unique way in their own niche and The thing I love about funnel hacking live is I take a look over the last few years Some of the speakers we've had on would be people you normally wouldn't expect to see on stage And you go my gosh if he can do it or she can do it. I know I can't do so over the course of four days We typically will have anywhere from 10 to 14 speakers in addition that Russell speaks himself four or five times We really try to to gauge energy levels throughout the day Some of the things we've always tried to do is either bring in a comedian or we brought in rappers Or we're bringing in the Phantom of the Opera and they sing on stage Just trying to find different ways of really playing with the energy level of the audience and it's amazing to see the impact that has on Their ability to learn and also their ability to actually implement what they've learned I would encourage anyone else who's looking at having a keynote speaker not to be afraid of spending big money to get the right keynote speaker there It's amazing to see the impact that it has on the audience and they feel so connected because They know that you care about them that you are willing to spend the money to bring someone big in Russell I don't know if you truly know what you got yourself into here I'm gonna tell them a little story of how you and I started to work together You saw me speak at Joe Polish's event, right? Do you remember like coming up to me afterwards and you were like oh my god? That was amazing. We speak at funnel hacking. That would be awesome. I'm like sure great I'm like, do you know my fee and he's like yeah, no problem, and I'm like, okay cool So give you my card you're like we're gonna do this so a couple of weeks go by after Russell and I talk about presenting in his event and And I'm like dude is this is gonna happen He's like yeah, yeah There's just this thing I go what? He's like well we're brought in another speaker We brought him a big famous speaker and like we don't have the budget to bring you in now And I'm thinking like how is that my problem? and I said well dude listen, I don't speak that often anymore That's my fee. I would love to be there for you maybe next year and that was that was it remember that it was very clear And I get a text message a few hours later from this adorable clean-cut Mormon, right? And he just writes me screw it. I'll pay out of my own pocket. Let's do this and I'm like that's awesome That's awesome because what I saw from Russell in that moment was devotion not commitment But devotion when you are committed to something you'll still fall down When you're devoted you won't when something hits you when you're devoted you crush it Thank you for your time. I love you I There's nothing more fun in the office than to see that's kind of come up with who would be the ideal person Who's that dream person we want to get and then think anyway? We could really get them We got Tony Robbins was like no way we actually got Tony Robbins Who was a person that Russell spent years just networking with and providing value to? Tony Robbins, it's a huge celebration when we're able to land that big fish of the end I didn't realize how important having a theme would be initially because we didn't have one It was fun like you live and we're coming to hack funnels together I remember sitting down and writing the headline for I think the third fun I can live and I remember thinking the concept of like you're one funnel way for being rich I was like, oh, that's so cool. Like what everyone believed the one phone with me rich I remember riding the headline and looking out for a minute sitting back and be like seems so shallow like They've been rich is cool That's not why most people do it maybe initially but most people wanted because the impact on my cable You're one funnel way from changing the world. That's like, oh, that's really cool I'm like that speaks to people that are impact or some people it's not some people just hate their job They just want to get free. Okay, you're one funnel way from firing your boss. I'm like, ah, I deleted everything It's not one funnel way. I'm trying to think trying to think and then I kept looking at that. I was like It's different for everyone like the result they want is gonna be different But this is the tool that gets in that result. I said one funnel way like that's that's the theme That's the concept and so the last couple fun like life that's been the theme every year people like what's the new theme? Like no, that's the theme like this is a recurring thing like this process for all of us You guys is an up and a down like it's it's always happening and all of you guys are somewhere in this wave right now Right some of you guys are at the top riding it some you guys are at the bottom in a crash You guys are somewhere in between and it's always going up and down But if nothing else of this event like I wanted you guys to all understand that like no matter where you are There's hope it might not be this funnel I can't tell you how many funnels flopped I have to guarantee I have failed the more funnels than anybody else in this room because of That we found out what worked and the only way to do that is to do it over and over and over again And it's a lot easier now I promise you so much easier than what we used to do and that's why this tool is so important because you can do that you Can test you can try over and over and over again And so people try to think of a theme it really comes back to like what's the end result? You're trying to get for your customers coming event like what is the thing that they're looking for? What's never and everyone comes for a different purpose to different reasons and somehow your event is a vehicle to get them there And so how does how does it do that like that's you got to figure out? I Kind of have a button niche to where if I scroll too much and I don't see blue I'm like, oh, I need a button. My name is Jake Leslie. I handle all the design for click funnels I'm Nick Sanders and I build the funnels. I manage all the process behind Making the funnels and coordinate the team get everything The funnel hacking live funnel is probably one of our biggest funnels that we make every year All the pressure is on us to perform and to make it awesome one mistake on a funnel building side or anything could literally cost us millions and millions of dollars I Design concept basically was based off of if I was sitting in funnel hacking live looking at that stage What would be my perspective of actually seeing that and so we're trying to kind of grab that energy Throughout the page itself. So the user kind of gets that experience before even the event starts So going from Russell to copy to design to funnel building to testing to implementing on that flow Makes a huge huge difference because I know that if I have copy and video that I can kind of base my design off of that Energy that that's giving me a big design tips that I really really abide by is one keeping on brand making sure you're staying Consistent consistency is everything all my headlines are the same all the buttons are the exact same color And there's no other distracting factors And that's the biggest thing is getting people excited about the event That's why we start with the big one sales page We always put the promotional video at the start to get people super excited Looking at the previous year and so they get excited to read more about what's coming in this year's event Late nights when you're sitting there working and you know, you just feel like you can't push anymore This is one funnel way one funnel way that rings true in your head to be like man What if I just make one thing that's gonna work one funnel that's gonna actually work When you go down a sales page the audience from the top to the very bottom diminishes very very rapidly One key thing is a date and the button above the fold so I can see clearly see the call to action I can read the label of the copy. I know exactly what I need to do to opt in as we scroll down the page You'll consistently see that same button as you go through almost creating a habit to be like, okay, that's where I click That's where I click. That's where I click It goes back into basically the strategy of a funnel What is the goal of a funnel is to guide your customer to your specific goal that you want them to do whereas a website is Super distracting and your customers have no idea what's going on being able to use click funnels is a huge advantage Events are crazy crazy stressful to begin with this is the last thing that you want to worry about Once the funnels done, you're good. You can go off and spend months focusing on your event. This will just make money for you So it's a vending machine online Only takes one way ideal one big thing that's implemented Just one funnel away from having the life they've always wanted We are funnel hackers Here to remind you one more time Your life you want Marriage you want and the family that you want is gonna be fueled by the businesses that you build You're only one funnel away So I'm Dan usher I run click funnel studios Which is the production company that creates all the video content that adverts that sells fun liking life Wait that creates a content. I've never My background is filming like cultural festivals and stuff like that unique experiences around the world So going into an event space, you know in a hotel room Not that cool. So I threw my little seasoning on it and sent it off to him and turns out he liked it It all started with when Russell said bring the magic now as a production company Our goal is to bring the magic every single day click funnel studios is producing Contents for everything funnel hacking live being one of the biggest Basically, we've studied and watched every single other event film that's out there We study after movies for electronic music festivals and see what they're doing We study music videos lighting color so we can add it to the elements So we have an after movie that has a very distinct feel when we're growing up We learn a lot of things about life from life that are just not true Six days a week one day off a week one week off every six months And I wish I had someone to educate me that college was gonna bring me food stamps with click funnels It's the goal to be the pattern interrupt. It's funny I talk about like people should be funnel hacking and modeling people right when the first person does something It is a pattern interrupt So it works really well because then what happens next is then all people who saw like oh my gosh That's amazing. They start modeling and they start doing it. Also like it was you're doing it now It's like 10 people do it in the 20 and then the pattern interrupt becomes the pattern And so then like what you're doing is no longer effective because ever seen the same thing So for me, it's always like I'm trying to see it fast and implement it or try to invent or whatever that is because Those creative risks are what caused the biggest swing right the first person to do it Is the biggest pattern interrupt and then it'll become the pattern eventually So for me, I still think the most important thing is for interviews when you are recording interviews for your event You need to get real sound bites Most people are just looking for those conventional this event was amazing. This is going to take my business to the next level It's all the same and I feel like that's one of the biggest mistakes when people are hiring filmmakers for their events The interviewer does not know the product Does not care about the people and therefore they can't have a real conversation Where as we go in and we know exactly how to communicate with these people at the end of the day It's a conversation. We want to hear their story how they got there What this event really means to them? Who's that one person that they met that's going to change their business? What is that one piece of information that one nugget or something that they're going to go home and be able to implement? Like we want them to naturally tell us what they got out of this So our interviews do not feel like normal interviews. They feel like we're just conversing When I joined it all started with just producing the videos for the funnel That was the main selling point But now as the event grows we need countless retargeting ads for people that need, you know 7-8 touch points before they make a big decision to go to a live event in order to do that We need to get extra creative with ways that we're going to disrupt people from the day to day And remember that funnel hacking the lives coming and they better get their tickets That's where the creativity of the whole team comes together and we sit around brainstorming and then come up with the most absurd ridiculous funny creative or emotive ways that we could get people on board Someone wants to create like an entire hyperlapse video and show off the event space as a whole of what people are going to visually see when they come to the hotel great Someone says they want to make a planet earth parody and hire david attenborough a fiver to do a voiceover about the funnel hackasaurus Cool, we do that Hackers spring into motion flocking 30 miles per hour in a race towards seat supremacy If someone hears in a testimonial that that you know the person says oh funnel hacking live is where you come to get the fire and Like the room on fire. So funnel hacking live is the place that people come to get the fire These are all Fire layers around 134 layers and then there's a second nested sequence and this one has 63 layers So in total about 420 layers. Yeah math math. Yeah I think of all the things that we do I think funnel hacking live is probably the most important most valuable thing that we Produce we put on but the problem is this also of everything we sell is by far the hardest thing to sell you think about Software information products like it's like an impulse buy right with this It's not impulse buy because someone's got to go and they have to get work off and they've convinced their spouse They have to find babysitters for their kids and they got to flights and hotels and there's so many more Decisions that are made not just one and so for us. It's like a constant grind to sell tickets every year How are we gonna sell 4 500 tickets? How are we gonna sell 600 tickets? How are we gonna sell? You know 2000 tickets and it's just always an impossible task that ends up happening I'm john parks and i'm the vp of traffic at click funnels and what that means is that I run all the advertising and the social media and that whole department to make sure that there's always lots of excited people coming in the doors This is the day So yeah, so once they once they opt in or become become your data And we you know, we did some really fun things one thing we did was um A telephone where we set up a table full of Of our customer support agents with telephones and we actually had a full telephone system going and broadcasted this Streaming live since we don't have a tv station We did it live into our facebook channels and into our youtube and it was russel teaching Just fantastic content and the whole time was like if you like what we're teaching here You'll definitely like fun like you live because that's even more of the same value So that connection was really strong and then we're just giving away tons of prizes This is um one of those things that could be like the most brilliant marketing idea in the history Of marketing so you know it or it could be the biggest We live? Ah, we're live! What's up everybody? We're welcome to our first ever and maybe last ever we'll find that afterwards Quick Funnel's telethon. That was really fun and not only did we sell A good block of tickets during the telethon. We're able to reuse that recorded video of the telethon I'm over time to sell a bunch more tickets But as we know there's very few people who will just buy a thousand dollar ticket in the drop of a hat And so we knew retargeting was going to be our biggest strategy So coming back in front of them and giving them more reasons of more understanding or more Emotion to get them to actually buy that ticket right so we went for 10 days and then we just stopped at logic emotion scarcity urgency those were the kind of the The spectrums we were we were hitting so it was really fun my gosh Anytime you can sell tickets and have fun doing it and get the whole the cool thing is just from It's your culture standpoint. I mean people are like what the heck are you guys doing? Blowing up like the ones who invent new marketing like he's Interesting bringing out and everyone's like oh like Jim Edwards is texting just like that was awesome I feel like we're at the top of our game right now and everything we do is like unique and innovative and people seem like whoa You'll see dice doing this you'll see traffic inversion like no there's a discounting ticket It's been discounted we increase the value of discount the price. So that's the difference our first event that I did I think cost us maybe half a million dollars if that To where now, you know, just the food bill is half a million dollars Enjoy the food because it's it's not cheap. I am Clint Adams. I am the director of accounting and Finance officially on the org chart though. My title changes depending on what I need to do and who I'm talking to We went from registering 600 people my first year to up 4,000 or more this last year And we've gone from essentially a half a million dollars to over two million as we've grown the event We've probably quadrupled our costs mostly the hotel So san diego was selected before I came into the role But I know that there was a lot of internet marketers down in san diego and it's an easy flight for us The location was perfect. It was a beautiful hotel right on the marina there And the hotel size was perfect like we just took over pretty much the whole hotel in event space It was a fun first event to put on Then we went to dallas and dallas was a location we wanted to try just because it is kind of like in the middle A little bit more and the space to fit 2,500 people too and we had dinners that we did onsite And so we just needed to make sure we were able to take over plenty of that hotel And then from dallas we went to orlando and the reason why we went to orlando is because we were growing quite a bit bigger Our concern was we were going to have to go to a convention center And that's not the look I love like when I do an event I want everyone to feel they're somewhere special if I went to a convention center I'm putting another 200 000 into an event that needs to be made pretty when you get it right off the bed at the hotel Typically our hotel is maybe a little over a million dollars We went from being the small town event trying to find people to Please help us throw this event to now we have the audio video crew. They went from, you know, 50 60 to now they're several hundred thousand dollars We've got probably 40 45 guys in here right now On and off throughout the day. We've got about a thousand feet of truss close to 200 moving lights about 80 non-moving static lights 65 foot wide by 18 foot tall video wall a concert pa coverage. It's going to be a hell of a show man It's going to help create an environment right it's going to be creating an environment for all the attendees who are coming here to learn and Pick up knowledge over the next few days. It'll be good I mean listen it creates an it creates an atmosphere it creates an energy Sure, you could disseminate a message with just screens and projectors or whatever the case is but You're trying to create a movement I mean how you could do it with a webinar if that's if you wanted to go basic enough, right? But you're trying to create a movement get 4 000 people motivated behind one one concept and that's what you're going to be able to do with this room. So I mean you name it. We got a lot. We got a lot of moving parks in here Hey, man. How's it going? Amazing. How you doing? Good It's about yeah, we are 15 minutes away from taking it all out Hotel written these kind of things you just have to call them everywhere you go. What's that all this stuff? Everything the hotel does the trust in the motors everything else we trucked in Earlier today there were like 653 foot trailers out of the water pockets What is happening just for context purposes our very first event. I don't think we had any rigging at all I think it was we had 600 people. We didn't there was no rigging. We had the definitely wasn't too set to scream We had we had a floor board behind the stage. Those are side. We had a Ferrari and a Corvette there It's bigger but hopefully it still feels super intimate because everything's gonna be pretty close It's like seven and a half times what we had the first time huge We wouldn't have been able to scale to a 4 000 Person or more event without Sage and so that's been the one big cost the amount of pressure or stress on us knowing that we have The sage crew there to support and help has helped us immensely So my goal with you today is just to give you some really macro level Overviews on what we're going to do together this week and give you some context of what's happening behind the scenes Because I think it makes your job so much easier I'm very bomb gardener and I am the founder and executive producer at sage event management We're the event production company behind funnel hacking live Almost always for our clients money is almost secondary they really care about impact So when I think about live events and how we're designing them the clients we work with We're always starting with what kind of impact do we want to make? How are we going to design the coaching program to deliver that and then how are we going to reverse engineer the live event to deliver the coaching program? One of the things that I really liked about how this event worked is Even though we were at this massive property When you came into this event you started to recognize little touches like wait a second Click funnels really is here When you walked in and you start talking to the people that you're interacting with at the front desk They're wearing click funnels hats the tv's behind the front desk are showing a loop of previous click funnels events As you start to walk to your room there's signage all over the place That's click funnels branding from our perspective community building is one of the most important things you do at a live event Everywhere they went we wanted them to feel like yes We're funnel hackers We wanted them to be really super psyched to be part of this tribe and that was a big thing that we did this year There was a lot invested by russell and the team in branding and in print We've never done anything to that skill, which is amazing. I want to say was 30 40 000 to get all that done maybe a little more It's all of a sudden like you're no longer at a gaylord property. You're actually at the click funnels hotel If you want to create a culture and you want to create a community branding isn't just your logo whatever you're selling Whether it's your info product or your actual physical product if you want people to expect a high perceived value of what you do You can send that message by giving them high quality apparel and promotional products up front My name is brandon pugmeyer and I am the owner of a company called imprint city I actually have been working with the russell's team before click funnels began of course back then the orders weren't quite as big We did t-shirts to begin with and then we started doing long sleeve t-shirts People wanted some hoodies water bottles, you know hats. That was pretty cool. And then the backpacks We sold out of them in the first day and a half One thing I've learned from russell when he was coming to me and asking for options He originally was like hey, we want the most expensive t-shirts available and I was showing him other options. He's like no I want the best quality The other thing I think that that click funnels has done at first they they had some messages on their shirts That was really about click funnels the messages have morphed to where the message on the click funnel shirts Is the message that the client or the customer the user of click funnels It's their message too and when you can connect the message of your client in your message It's a home run A lot of companies put their logo on the shirt and they give it out But when you give out a shirt that's actually hey, this is a shirt. I want to wear because this is my message This is who I am like funnel hacker. I'm a funnel hacker or a lot of the shirts russell does he'll put a Manifesto on it that that kind of has a philosophy behind it that the person wearing it's like that is cool I want to wear that and so it sends this message. It's not just click funnels message It's a shared message with the user and so when you can combine the the company message With the user message and you put them into one. It's perfect Surround yourselves with the dreamers the doers the believers and the thinkers most of all Surround yourself with those who see greatness within you even when you don't see it yourself Which is what family is all about so this is what the community is about is you mean Don't blame yourself surround yourself with amazing people who believe in you One of the things that you guys are best at we saw this last year is just extraordinary customer care Like you care deeply you're really committed to the brand and to changing lives and when you come into an event feeling that way The attendees feel it and it makes a huge difference. What's happening today. That's really critical is registration And this is one of your first touch point moments the person who you're seeing at registration Left behind a family or a dog or kids or clients. They had to get on a plane or get in a car They had to pack the bag. There's been some sacrifice for them to get here They may have also incurred delays at the airport delays with the pickup delays and checking into their room By the time they get to you I promise you whatever has stood in their way has started to build up and be like I sure hope this is worth it I knew I know this was a mistake I shouldn't have even have come this is going to be a whole challenging week And we have to remind them at registration that they made the right choice Like I really see registration as right choice moment like that kind of energy is welcome to the family We're so happy you're here. How did you get here? Where did you come from? What made you decide to come for those of you who are floating during registration having those conversations can be the difference between Standing in a dull line and having an enlivened conversation that reminded you of why this is the right choice 50 yeah, we have 50 people in line. We haven't even started Oh my goodness. Look at all those look at all those people Dan Sure. Should we get a big? Early bird I we're gonna like it. We like a big early bird. Who raw over here? Can I turn and look at Dan? I'm Blake When attendees are coming in Robbie's on the front lines if you don't know Robbie summer seat is the loudest person I've ever met I don't know where he gets it from it is Wednesday funnel hacking live We're ready to rock our employees feed off of that and then the attendees feed off those employees and they feed off of Robbie So rule number one get a hype man or one So once they get past Robbie like then it's our the rest of our staff like our job is to have that smiling face to keep that excitement up We got to be like hey, you're here for funnel hacking life That's so amazing like registration's right down there after that you're gonna go get your amazing swag bag Check out this shirt. This is sure you guys are getting this year You have to get that excitement because they've gone through a lot of stuff to get to that event So you've got to get that energy up the second they walk into register You know our whole Goal and mission while we're at that event is to make it the best experience for every single attendee And if we're not keeping that energy up if we're not excited if we're not pumped if we're not loving what we're doing They sense that and their energy falls So once you register all these people come in they have their name badge They have their swag bag. They now have their shirt like they're ready to go They're sitting there they're hanging out the excitement keeps building and building and building and all of a sudden our registration That's supposed to be a boring process this tiny process Just to get them to the event is now like one of the coolest things they've seen and that's day zero Like we haven't even started the event They're just jacked to be there and just keeps growing and growing and growing All of a sudden our doors are getting backed up and backed up and backed up We got people yelling louder and louder and louder to communicate with everybody telling them Hey, we're gonna be opening the door soon and then finally we get that call and it's time. Hey We knock on the doors from the inside we open it up people free can just rush in like crazy everybody's losing the mind Their staffs losing the mind the attendees are losing their mind music's blasting It's even louder than it was before And literally all that starts from registration. It's a boring simple process Or what it's supposed to be is not that way of funnel hacking life We start midday here on day one So you've got more registration and then we get to our openings And the opening is where rustle will really kick it off and set the tone for the event with the help of divan Who's going to take the stage first and get that crowd going This is not about reading cue cards If you want to get bob from accounting to come on stage and read a cue card because he's good at the christmas parties Hey, you have at it. Your event's probably going to suck. I don't mean to sound mean But that's not what this is about Get on your feet and welcome to the stage your mc for the event My job is to be the through line Through the entire event from start to finish So i'm the very first person your audience sees and i'm probably the very last person they see Before every speaker after every speaker before every break i'm giving them instructions And so if i can't build rapport with them then i might as well not even try The letters mc Normally stand for master of ceremonies. I would say that my real role is More like an me which is the master of energy I want you to think of me kind of like your event coach It's to be the through line from speaker to speaker to speaker to speaker to speaker to speaker to speaker It's to tell the audience here's what you need to do. Here's where you need to be etc etc etc It's to say here's how what this speaker is speaking about here's how this is important to the entire event So give yourself a round of applause for being sexy, right? You didn't tell bob to do all that All you told bob what to do is introduce the speakers So bob is going to go up and read the cue cards reading cue cards is not room management Reading cue cards is not feeling the room feeling what's going on being able to engage and have fun with the crowd Reading the cue cards is give it up for the last speaker our next speaker is mary and she wrote three books And she's really great give it up for mary The hell was that it was what you told bob to do So You can't get mad at bob for that Yeah, that's what I would say about bob from acounty When you hire people who have the experience Then what you're really paying for are all of the things that you don't know that you don't know They're hiring for that very first consultation that says stop right there your schedule is off from the jump Because you said nine ten eleven twelve and schedules don't work like that You're hiring somebody to go out there read the energy in the room Realize that the last speaker was a snooze and that's okay because he or she was talking about something very technical cool Not mad at that Throw the cue card out the window Find out the essence of what the speaker is going to speak about and communicate that in such a way that wakes the audience the hell back up That's what you're paying for Those are the intangibles Those are the oh my gosh. I didn't even know that I needed that. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So like you get what you pay for The most important time for the event mc 60 of my work Is done in the first 15 minutes on day number one the very first time I go on stage That first 15 minutes sets the tone for everything Because I will do an exercise with the audience where I'm gonna say Welcome to the stage and what you're gonna do is you have to stand up and you have to go crazy And you have to respond the way as if I'm bringing you to the stage and showing me How you would want the crowd to react when you're on stage and so we'll do that exercise and that starts me training them So now the expectation is set Before the event kicks off that this is how we introduced the speakers So it's trained So it's trained so much that even if I get to a speaker later on in the day and I forget to tell them to stand up They've already been trained to stand up Everything is trained So Two First Second Ele cracking So I believe in good habits and all of us can choose good habits. Stop waiting to be happy, start generating happy. Decide I'm gonna do this or I'm gonna die working on it. But stop letting yourself off the hook and be willing to go down so you can go up. Spend $50, make $500, that's the funnel guys. No, we got more, we got more, but. Get under your feet and welcome to the stage! Let's go! Let's go! The day that we had the idea for ClickFunnels, we sat in a room for about a week, whiteboarding out the whole vision of it, and on the way, taking him back to the airport, he was flying back home where he lives in Atlanta. He said one thing before we got out of the car, he said, hey, really quick though, if we're gonna do this whole ClickFunnels thing, I don't wanna be like an employee, I wanna be your partner. I remember being so scared like, I don't know if I, like I'm an entrepreneur, I control everything all the time, I was so scared. And in that moment, I made the second greatest decision in my life, outside of marrying my wife. And I told him yes. And that man is Todd Dickerson, who's my co-founder and partner at ClickFunnels. Let's give Todd a huge round of applause, stand up, Todd, come on out! What's up? Oh man. Wow. What's up, funnel hackers? So my role going into funnel hacking live is still very much behind the scenes, other than one presentation that Russell and I do just about every year. And we actually talk about things that have happened over the past year, and things that we're planning to do going forward in the next year. During the ClickFunnels event, we always do a presentation that we call the ClickFunnels State of the Union Address. I think that most software companies' events are literally only focused on kind of the State of the Union aspect. They get up there and that's all they talk about. They're like, okay, we got these features, we got this product, we got this thing we're doing, and then it's like, have a good day, see you guys. That's what Apple does, right? Like, Apple gets up on stage, here's the things we're releasing, here's the timelines that you're going to see them coming out. See you guys later. Everybody's excited, it's cool. But we focus more on actually like the whole experience. Can we say like, oh, so this is a problem, and like here's the solution. But instead it's like you ask the problem. And then I'm like, here's a problem we saw, and that's how I was phrasing it at first, and I'm like, but that just doesn't sound, it sounds dumb. Yeah, let's do like, I'll play like dumb like, oh well guess what we're doing. Well guess what, we're working on that. That's cool, I like that. That'll help me. Because I was a little concerned about this because I'll be going for like 120 slides. Like if you look at each one of these features of ClickFunnels, these are whole companies. It's all built in to work together. And as fast as we expanded, we expanded in the number of users that rely on this software. We're running 77,000 companies, not one. Yeah. No pressure, right? This is the thing I need your help with. You just talk about some new features, some new things, stuff they're creating, stuff they're thinking about, stuff that's already live. But I need your guys' feedback to know like what you want the most. Stephen, you stand up to scream real quick to show the answer. No, Steve. Yeah, that's what we need. And the louder the screams, the more likely we are to create that first. Cheer as loud as you possibly can for the features you want next, and then we'll prioritize based on the loudness of the room. That sound fair? You guys are going to do a roadmap, right? The sub-users project has to be live at Funnel Hacking Live. No questions asked. Like, we promised it last year. If there's anything that's going to block us from actually making this in progress turn to completed in the next few weeks, like, we've got to make that happen. So see if there's any other ones like that. That's basically what we've got to go through here and find now. I always want to focus on making sure users know that we're listening to them. So we always, we take feature requests all year long. We listen to customer support requests. Set up, it's connected, everything's done. That's all you got to do. That's simple these days, right? The event gives us a chance to actually tell people that we're listening and show them that we're listening. And we may think that we have the best idea in the world, but that's not always the case. Sometimes we just need to listen to the customers and hear what they're saying. Not by mistake, day two is more of the same. And a typical Sage event is three days. So I also look at this as like kind of a bonus day of content connection and community. Like our average host doesn't have the stamina for four days, really truly. I mean, I think Russell is a force of nature. All right. So we just got stage up day two of All I Can Live. I'm feeling a little sick, super sore. And one of my friends told me that the best thing to do when you're on stage every day is do an ice bath, but I'm scared of an ice bath. So I called the manlyest man I know and said, can you help me do an ice bath? This is Anthony. And they said, don't you have anyone else to call? I'll be right there. Like psychologically move into it and completely surrender and like sort of gently scan your body and just let all attention go. Yes. All right. The biohacker bro's delivery service. You want to go? And it's like you'll be in this very stressful situation for other people, but like you're like training your mind and your body and your nervous system to remain calm. And then you'll feel the benefit afterwards. You'll have this like uplift in energy and mood, but it also translates to real life. Like things roll off your shoulders more easily. You stay more cool, calm and collected because you've trained it. We're going for 45 degrees. Are you going to go next? Maybe. Yeah, we're good. I mean, it really does. Like it's two minutes that pays dividends for a day. Yeah. Perfect. I'd say that's about 38 degrees right now. Yeah. You're getting pretty. You got it. Go over your fingers. Take deep breath. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. There you go. Good. Good. Good. Find your breath. Find your breath. Ah, that's a bad part. You got it. Oh my gosh. Good. Take deep breath and slow it down. Mind over matter. Slow it down. There you go. Ouch. Relax your face. Good. You're doing great. You're doing great. You're doing great. You're a warrior. Wait. Wait. I'm going. Here we go. One, two, three. Oh my gosh. You got this. Don't take it back. You got it. You got it. You got it. You got it. Come in. Drop now. Nice. Good job. Push it out. Big one in belly expands. Hold. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Push it out. I did great. I'm going to give it to your husband. He's crazy but pihacking seems to work so might as well do what you have to do when you're on stage for all those hours. What we're doing here to me is a bonus day of extra content connection and community because we're doing that same thing here. And then what we do at the end of day two is super important. It's called round tables. And round tables, much like Rolodex, are all about connection and community. Because what happens there is you have your students, your speakers, your trusted advisors in a room, at a table, and any person can go sit down and ask these superstars anything they want to. But it started off first year. We called it a hackathon back then. It was people coming in with their computer, getting together, working on their funnels and having support people there to help launch that right then in real time. My name is Brent Copeters, and I'm VP of coaching and events at ClickFunnels. Year two, we started round tables. And what it is, we literally have round tables in a room. And we invite some funnel hackers that have had success to sit at a round table. And it allows for our members to build, come in and sit down and ask questions to these experts. These are all people who have had success using our software. And we thought, what a better way to have people be able to ask questions and model what they were doing. It's a refreshing build. They're rubbed shoulders with people who've been there. They've gone through what you're going through, and they can empathize. Just a really interactive experience. So a really cool thing that we added more recently for Funnel Hack in Live was our funnel Rolodex. Hey, Miles, hope you're doing good. I've got a really cool idea. I want to run by you. Let me know you get a chance and come in and you can mean about it. People that we partner up, people who sell services or help build funnels for folks, come in. And they can be able to explain what they do and essentially offer their services to the members of our community. So if you're looking for someone who does video work, you're looking for someone who can build funnels, you're looking for someone who can be a potential accountant or someone who can keep your books, you can find out about the Rolodex event. Just helps people get clarity. And they're finally able to build their funnels. These way for you is to just sign up for our lead, for our off the form. It's really cool. For Hack in Live, you're in the general session room for most of the days. But we always typically have after hours, late night tidying up activities. And here you are fighting to the end. We are the champions. We are the champions. No time illusions. And we are the champions. And we have arrived. All of the funnels are inside with some beverages and food and people and more live music with some kick butt fans. So let's go in there. We're going to have a good time. Let's go. All right, down there, over there. It's a valuable time that you have with your members in your community. And you need to take every advantage you have with that. It really will make a way better experience for them. And it's proven that way for us. At the end of the day, looking at feedback from post-event, networking is so huge. That's what people want. And I think it's a great opportunity to have a lot of people who are in the community. And I think it's a great opportunity to have a lot of people who are in the community. And I think it's a great opportunity to have a lot of people who are in the community. And it's so huge. That's what people want. They want a cool, environmentally-built network with cool people. And something to take pictures of, like, just social proof again. Live music just warms up space. It does, man. Live music's the best. And even if they suck at singing, it's still like, this is cool. It is. It was just one more again, one more touch that people knew that we cared. And we thought about just something different. Yeah. Again, doing it again this year. More live music. More lounges, more everything. So it's going to be a pump. Oh, wow. What do you got there? I don't know. It's something from ClickFunnels. Wow. What did ClickFunnels send us? Let's see. You have to help your audience break their four-minute mile. Now, 1954, Roger Bannister broke what everybody thought was impossible. The four-minute mile. Like, it wasn't possible. It wasn't supposed to happen, right? He did it. And then what happened after he did it? People saw it was possible. And they're like, dang, he did it. I can do it. Okay. And for me, I had a similar experience. I wrote the date down this morning. So I went and forget. August 17th, 2004 was the day that the four-minute mile was broken for me. I just got into this business and I was happy. My goal when I got started was $1,000 a month. I could make $1,000 a month. Like, that's it. I'll be free. My wife and I can go on dates. We could get a nice car. A thousand bucks a month would change our life. Our basement. I didn't have some retros very soon, very soon. My email address at the time was moneyforcollegeatjuno.com. And this email popped in and it said, subject line was something like, we did it. I was like, did what? And I click on this and there's an email from John Reese. And John at the time, I had heard about this. He was launching a new course called Traffic Secrets. In an email, he explained, he said, look guys, we launched Traffic Secrets earlier today. He sort of broke down. He said, at 18 hours, we had sold a thousand copies at $1,000. So that means we made a million dollars in just 18 hours. I remember sitting there, like everything around me just got quiet. I sat back in my chair and I was like, he made a million dollars in a day. My goal was a thousand dollars a month. This guy made a million dollars in a day. I didn't know that was even possible, but he did it. And I was like, that's my goal. I don't want to make a million dollars a day, but I want to make a million dollars. I started in the math. He had a thousand-hour course. He sold a thousand copies. What if I created a course with a thousand dollars? I sold three a day. Like if in a year, I'd make a million dollars in a year. And it became so clear, so crystal clear to me that it was possible that it became real for me. I could taste it. I went back and afterwards I started working. I was like, I'm gonna make a million dollars. I'm gonna make it. It wasn't even in my radar prior to that. I was like, I'm gonna make a million dollars, make a million dollars. The first year I went for it, I didn't make a million dollars. Next year I tried it again. It's anything I was shy of like 50, 60, that I didn't make it two years in a row. And I was like, John did it. I can do this. I have to do it. And the third year, the third try, we did it. We broke it. I think we did it in 1.2 million dollars that year. And I was like, God, we did it. But for me, the reason why I was able to do that, the reason why I'm here in front of you guys today is because John broke the four-minute mile for me. We wanted to do this for inside of Quickphones. I was like, what's the equivalent for us of a four-minute mile? What can we give people to give them a goal to shoot after? And I thought, well, if you have a funnel that makes a million dollars, that's pretty cool. And I was like, I wonder inside of Quickfunnels how many have made over a million dollars. And so I had Dave and Tracy and some of the guys go through all the stats and pull everything out. I was expecting we had maybe a dozen people that made a million dollars in the funnel. Anyway, Dave got the report back and messaged me. He's like, dude, we've had over 50 people that have made over a million dollars so far. So are you kidding me? So this is called, we decided to call it a two comma club award. In a million dollars, there's two commas. And so for you guys, every single time you have a funnel that makes over a million dollars, we're going to send you one of these amazing trophies to put on your wall. Is that exciting? Okay, we've just received another package here at the office. I wanted to open it right here on camera for all of y'all. Something that me and my team have earned together. It's like a kid on Christmas morning. What's in the box? What's in the box? Honestly, guys, I never thought in a million years. This is the roll of it. Woo! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. This is a dream come true, man. I've visualized this over and over again. So many years to get to this. Wow. So this is not the only one. There we go. Now, the coolest thing though is like, we brought these all here. And I would say probably two thirds of those people that got that are here today. In fact, we're going to bring them on stage and we're going to give these to them. Because I want all of you guys who aren't here yet to see that and realize it's not just a couple of people. Almost a hundred of your peers have already done it. So this is the one that we'll be sending to everyone. We're getting many ones made of everyone and like our hallways will be wrapped in these things. When people come to our offices, like, dang, everyone makes a million bucks and click funnels. I need you to. We're only one, two, three, four, five, six plaques away from filling this whole entire wall. Check this thing out. This is absolutely insane. How many do you have now? The four minute mile has been broken. I want every single one of you guys that this is your goal is at least one of these to keep going on. Because every time you get a funnel, break some million dollars and send you another one. That's my goal for you guys. Okay, so for you guys, you got to think back into your business, like, what's that result that your people want? That they're dreaming about and desire, like, if I can have that, I'd be the greatest thing in the world. And then create something that gives them the ability to aspire to go towards that. Okay, it's helped them break the form in a mile. And as we bring attention to these action takers, to these people who stopped talking about it and started being about it, who took what Russell said and actually put it into motion. As we do that, I want you to imagine the entire time you being on this stage. I want you to imagine that it's your turn next. Can you do that? Yeah? Yeah. If you're going to be on this stage walking across next year, raise your hand high. Say I am. I believe it. So this is a really important night. Then they have the OUR premiere. OUR triple take, which is the new premiere for Operation Underground. So we want them coming back from this into this. Really, really important. If you can put 4,300 people in a room and every one of them gives a dollar, $10, $100, $1,000, and you're able to give in something you really profoundly believe in and you know you're helping to make a change in the world, you feel better about yourself. You feel better about this community and you feel like you're part of the community. So while it is about connection and it is about donations, it is also very much about community. And what we're here to do is build a community. The first day of Funnel Like A Life is all about belief. We're trying to then believe in two things. Number one, that this business model that we love, that we preach, we talk about, the funnels is going to work. And then number two, that they can actually do it, right? And then we try to give them something bigger than just the money to look towards, right? Because when money is the motivator, it's really hard to like stay motivated. And so we always introduce the charity number one and we show like, well, this is what money can do. And by them having that shift in their belief and their understanding, they're way more likely to actually be successful in business. Did you know that every time you create a funnel with click funnels, you are actually helping a child in Africa? Did you know that? I remember when I first got into business, I always thought like, that'd be cool to like do a charity thing. And I was always having in my head like, well, when we're successful, then we'll do a charity. Or when we make more money, like it was always this, this when thing. When click funnels launched, we kind of weaved it into the DNA initially. It was like, hey, whenever your funnel is built, let's donate a dollar. Like that started from, from the very, very beginning. And it's crazy because when people understand the mission, it bonds them to you at a different level than, than if you don't. You know, the companies like Tom's shoe, when every single shoe that was sold, they, they bought a shoe and gave it to some third world country. Someone who needed a shoe and like that social mission was, was huge. And I think people want to work with companies and brands and people who aren't just about money, just about themselves. Like there's more of a soul to the company than just a money thing. And so not only does it, you know, give your customers a vision of what's possible for themselves. It also helps them to connect with you, to trust you, to like you because you're not just in it for the money. And one of the charities is Village Impact. I got involved with this because I love Stu and I love Amy, I love them. And I was grateful enough that they took me there and let me experience it. But I love for you to just kind of talk for a few minutes just about, about where this thing came from and why you guys, why you're doing it. I'm talking to the chairman of this African community. We're talking about building a school and then I said, how much does it cost to fund the full-time salary of a teacher? And he said, it'll be about $100 a month. At the time we were selling a software product for $100. And I made this connection. If I sell one more product a month, that could fund the full-time salary of a teacher. And then I just kind of like expanded on that. The more money I make, the more impact I could have. And that really started to pump me up. The kickoff, like the giving process, we wanted to do something really fun. We got a huge check made up for World Teacher Aid. We're going to fund the next classroom for $12,000. So there you go, Stu. You guys are amazing. Thanks to you guys and your creation of funnels, we were able to raise $46,000 for World Teacher Aid. So, we got a check. In the last 12 months, she has done 78,460 funnels. Last year, you guys have built 133,737 funnels that have gone live inside of Cush Funnels. We want to give you guys, hopefully, the biggest check physically you've ever got before. Next year. Wow! That is crazy. You guys. Wow. We're just so grateful because every year we get invited to come back. And it's not something that we take for granted. The work that we do is in what's called IDP camps. These people were removed from their everyday life because of the violence that was happening and just moved to this rural area in the middle of nowhere. And to see their progress that's happening year over year, little by little, it's incredible. And it's having a huge ripple effect. The fact that this is woven into the business model of click funnels is humbling. And I'm so grateful to Todd and Russell and the whole ClickFunnels team. Huge credit to you guys. Thank you so much for being part of this community. And thank you for contributing whether you realize it or not. And thank you to the whole ClickFunnels team. Thank you, thank you, thank you. We've had a chance now to bring a whole group of funnel hackers to Kenya with us and let them experience it and be changed by it as well. We love you! Confusion sucked! Confusion sucked! We are... We are... ClickFunnels! ClickFunnels! Yay! We told our community all about all of you. We told them how special you are. And our community wanted to help with the vision. Now there are tens of thousands of entrepreneurs who every day are working to raise money for you. Santay Sana. So, today is going to be a really cool day. And I think it's going to be a day that for the rest of my life I look back on. I got a phone call today. Who's elder Ballard? He's one of the 12 apostles. My hands are sweating right now. I'm kind of freaked out. Don't mind me. My hands are bleeding. These drops are from here. Okay, so basically he said there's a group called the under... something underground? Underground Road? Is this the house that you're going to get out? Yes! They said that they're in a meeting and they said that for some reason they mentioned your name and thought you had some technology and skills that could help us with this mission. He said that they think that your big piece in this can help... I hope to save these kids from this thing and... Wow. My name is Tim Ballard. I'm the founder and CEO of Operation Underground Railroad. Which is a private organization dedicated to eradicating the world of child sex slavery. So I spent 12 years as a special agent as an undercover operator for the US government doing anti-trafficking work. After 12 years of working in these kind of cases, I decided to break away and start a private organization an organization that wouldn't be prohibited by jurisdictional limitations and bureaucracy. We're in 20 countries, 22 states in the United States. And we sit down with law enforcement in these countries and in these states and we say, what do you need so that you can be empowered to rescue more children? Oftentimes in foreign countries, one of the first things on their list is we need you to go undercover because it's the Americans who are the demand. It's the Americans who are the clientele that are abusing our children. So you guys can infiltrate quicker. Unfortunately, we are the demand in this country. We're the highest consumer, highest producer of child pornography. Which means countries like Columbia or Haiti or Thailand, they can use us, sign us up as undercover operators and we can infiltrate those black markets because we can connect with those dirtbag pedophiles who are hurting kids all around the world. We can find them and infiltrate them. So that's what we do and that's why we created Operation Underground Railroad. Probably the biggest challenge is making people aware that it's a problem. It's hard to fight something when the majority of people you're talking to don't know what you're talking about. The other reason is as a private organization, we can provide a vehicle for you, for the public to get involved. This is a problem that's not going to go away by sitting back and saying the governments are going to handle this. It's way too big. It's hard for decent people and I still think most of the people in the world are decent people. It's hard for them to wrap their heads around, but if they don't accept it, and it's one thing by the way to accept it and a whole other thing to stay in it. Earlier that year I'd been made aware of the organization, what they do, and we decided to help fund a documentary to get the message out about these children and how we can save them. And a lot of people in that situation walk away. Russell says, I'm going to dive deeper. I'll go as far as I can go with you. If you're in a dark place, there's a whole bunch of cockroaches. If you shine a light in the middle, then all the cockroaches have to scatter. So we looked at this documentary as like us shining a light to try to end this problem and try to solve it. We spent a whole bunch of time up to the event creating it, preparing it, and then we actually showed it at the first film of Hockey Live in one of the most emotional days slash weeks of my entire life. Thank you. Special hunt. I got a call probably six months ago from someone who asked if I'd be involved. I didn't even know what it was. That night I started googling and trying to figure out. I think I watched the Final Hacker TV stuff, but I made a video that night. I said, I'm pretty sure my life is going to change forever after this. I don't know what happened. A phone call out of the blue. I didn't even believe it. I was like, hey, we want to just follow you around and do something. And then I just saw this. I mean, I'm totally blown away. Thank you. Thank you so much. This couldn't have happened without ClickFunnels. It could not have happened. This whole thing, I'm blown away. Thank you guys so much. Thank you. There's these two charities that they're so near and dear to my heart. And they're so different, but the spirit, the feeling is the same. I'm like, on one side we're trying to educate these children, and on the other side we're trying to liberate children. And all of a sudden, like the phrase popped in my head, liberate and educate. I was like, oh my gosh, that's what we're doing for these children. We're liberating them from captivity, from slavery, and then we're educating them, giving them a future. And I saw the parallels also in the pattern of, that's what ClickFunnels does as a company as well. Like, we take entrepreneurs and we liberate them from their jobs, from things they don't love, and then we educate them on how to grow their companies. And as I was looking at those two things, I was like, that's what the mission is of ClickFunnels, is to liberate and educate both entrepreneurs and these children who can't do it by themselves. When you have a community who have been inspired and their goals are bigger than just themselves, like it's not my try to figure out how to pay my rent today, but how do I solve this problem? How do I help these children? How, like, they're thinking bigger than themselves. The monetary goals become super easy because they're looking for something bigger. And the work hard of the outwork anybody, because it's not just about themselves, it's about the change that they're going to make in other people's lives as well. That'll save a whole lot of kids' lives. That's just amazing and beautiful. Congratulations. I meant what I said about you up there. I don't say things lightly. I have such respect for you, Russell. You're the real thing. You're humble. You're beautiful. You add so much value. That's why I came back. Even though I don't see you, I consider you a friend and somebody I respect. What I love that you're doing now is you're teaching them to be givers and seeing the value of that and getting hooked on that. You know, to me, that's the most important thing. So congratulations. Thanks again. I definitely do know the fear a lot of people about incorporating charity, especially in their events, is that people come with the wall and there's so much money in their wallet, and if they spend it on charity, they may not spend it with other things you have. Funnel I Can Live Happen in Orlando was the one that we raised the most money for the charity. And also, interesting enough, was the event that we made the most money in coaching sales afterward. We're seeing backwards. You wouldn't think those two things are tied together. I don't know, from a business decision, you're getting people to open the wall for a good cause. It helps them to be more likely to open the wall. It's for you to continue to help them in the future with coaching, with your back in sales, whatever that thing might be on the other side, because you have this opportunity to really change them. We've been serving them hard for three days, and generally here is a self-amazing moment. We know, without question, they are 2, Club X. There is no chance if they do the work that they will not be a better entrepreneur. They will not do more, be more, and have more in 2019. This is where we give people the ability that they want to continue this process, to get them from where they are today to where they want to be. This is where we make the offer. The whole event's been choreographed for this, right? Before people go on stage, I show them what's possible. I give them the results of their goals. Like, here's the goal, you want to get a two-comic level work. They see the vision, and now let me show you guys the path and the process. There's three core things I need to give them the belief. The very first thing they have to believe is that this vehicle, this process is actually possible, right? So I'm telling stories to break any false beliefs. Anything else is possible besides this one thing. That's step number one. We have over 505 total people who have won the two-comic level work, and then 240 new ones since last month. 241 people! That's almost one person a day has sit at the two-comic level since last time we were all here hanging out together. Is that amazing? Okay? And these numbers are going up. These aren't some, like, business scholars. These are your friends. These are your peers. Look around. They're sitting next to you right now. Okay? This shouldn't be weird. This is happening all the time, so you can't dismiss it, you guys. But guess what I'm most excited for? We're out of all this stuff. What I'm most excited for is you guys on the stage next year. The next thing is people start thinking, well, that's really cool for them, but, like, what about me? Like, how is it possible for me? It's the next set of this presentation for me to help them understand that not only is it possible for people, but it's actually possible for you, specifically you. Some of you guys are sitting here in the audience, and you're watching people come on stage, and instead of saying, like, what does he believe? What does he, like, what do these people do? They've already done it. You're sitting back saying, no, no, no, like, I believe something different. For you to be successful, it's not about conforming the rest of the world to your beliefs. So, figuring out what the truth is, then conforming your beliefs to that. If you want to be successful, you find people who are already successful, and you model them. Okay? It's not, find people who are already successful and convince them that you're right. I'm telling stories about people who are in the same situation. Like, who was in the audience last year sitting in the stage, thinking they weren't going to be there, that this year came on stage and got the award. And then the third fault, I believe, I have to break is, you know, people are scared. Like, I believe this is the right process. I believe I can do it, but like, oh, my spouse, or my kids don't believe me, or I got a day job, or all the other external things. And I've got to show them those other things that aren't going to hold you back. If you plug into this community, if you plug into the peer group that you've just gotten around. Don't ask the question how. Ask the question who. Who already knows how to do this? You change your question, you change everything. Me and Todd were like almost completely broke. I was like, I'll work for free. He's like, I'll work for free. Like, sweet, we can afford this. And we built ClickFunnels. I'm the Dancing Monkey on stage. He talks about it. But there are some amazing people behind the scenes who did all the actual work, okay? I was the contractor who put the people and the things in place to make it a possibility. As you start going home tonight, start thinking about it, so we understand that your job, your role in this company, there's two things. Number one, you have to learn the strategy. That's why you've been here to understand the strategy. And your second goal is to assemble your own dream team. That's it. That's where you stop. You do not learn all the other pieces. You understand the strategy, you find your dream team. Then another question is like, well, Russell, what's your job? What's the job that you guys do over here? So our job is to support you in those things, okay? Another question, how many of you guys here would be interested in me and my team helping you to earn a two-comma club over the next 12 months? All right. Well, this is now your official invitation. So we've got them to believe those three things. All they need is they need a really, really good offer. It's the way we teach people to do an offer through a process called a staff. That's very simple, but it's like the most powerful thing in the world. It's the very first thing you explain. Here's the first part of my offer. The first thing that's going to happen inside the two-comma club-ex coaching program is we're going to help you guys to master the funnels. These are all amazing human beings, and they're going to be your coaching staff for the next 12 months. Is that amazing? Everyone, this is your tribe. These are the people who have been here for at least a year who have had success in this program, who are here to pull you up and to push you as you go. She explained what that is. You talk about it, and then you do a stack slide. She basically says, you're going to get this, and this is the value of it. You're going to get the coaches and mentors of the tribe. Then you reduce the second part of the offer. So not only do you get a thing I just talked about, you're going to get this thing as well. You talk about that. You need the funnel waffle mastery live event. Then it transition now to the third thing. Here's the third component. You're going to explain what that is. Get them all excited about that. Then come back to the stack slide again. And then the bonus live experience is we have the unlock the secrets parents and kids event, the two common club X, platinum mastermind session after you pass that. And then we've got the two common club in here, circle cruise. Total value of $118,973. I know it seems like a lot of money for most of you guys. But if you take a two common club, it's about 10% of that, which I think is fair. Now the human mind remembers that, that whole stack, not just the last bonus, remember everything. And then I introduced the price, dropped the price. Instead, you guys can do it for just $2,500 per month. And then people jump up and they go running to the back of the room. That's the magic of how you close somebody from stage and try to get them to get into your high ticket programs. When all of a sudden done, like we're a software company. And the goal is for us to have people who are successful with our software. So if we can coach them and mentor them and push them through this process, make sure they're more successful. That's what gets the entire company, the entire platform to grow. Yes, it is very profitable. Yes, you can make a lot of money with it, but it's bigger than that. I hope you guys see that because the money that comes in, like we spent a ton of it. I'm reinvesting the fulfillment to the people who signed up. The long term is the success of the students. And if everything's choreographed towards that, and then serving them at the highest level possible, that's really the biggest impact. And education is the piece that fuels and drives it. And that's what no other software company does. The blending of those two things together is what's changed everything for us. Our role in this is to like be an example, like this is what's possible and then people are taking stuff and using them. And it's been fun. On the event side, I've watched our friends in the real estate space, Justin, Terry, they launched the packing, and I've been modeled everything. Alex and Layla doing it with Gym Launch. And they're in industry, they're in business, helping gyms to grow and to scale and using these principles inside of gyms. Brandon and Caleb Poland over at Ladyboss doing events, changing women and helping them lose weight and having to choose transformation over there. And so it's been really cool seeing the people inside of our community that are taking these principles and modeling them and using them in each of their individual businesses and seeing the impact that's come for them as well. The last thing I want to mention is to put on an event like this, it takes an army of amazing people. It takes a ton of support from the families of everyone involved, but there's over 100 people here that have killed themselves to put on this event for you guys. So I just wanted to give a second, to give my entire team a huge round of applause for all the work that they put into this whole event. And there are six people that, without their love and support and sacrifice would not make any of this possible. The ClickFunnels spouses, the survivors, the women who have made all this possible. I think the definition of ClickFunnels is like, sacrifice, because there's so many nights where we didn't have our husbands because they were fighting for you. To see all of you guys here and to see how much you guys just are obsessed with this company is really like pouring back not only into our hearts, but back into our marriage and back into our families. You know, it's one of my favorite parts of following the live when it's done the last day, we go out to dinner together and we all just kind of hang out. At that point I'm so too tired to talk and I just look around and look at them all and I'm like, man, there's a lot of people that made this thing possible. I'm so grateful for them that they believe in the same vision I do because I couldn't do it without them. And the fact that they're here, they're bought in, that they're doing it, this is their mission as well now, it's really special. The reason why I do this, why I'm obsessed with this, is because every single person that we're able to touch and change during this event, it doesn't just affect them. Usually it starts with them and then it affects their families. And then as they start growing, then they start hiring employees and a team and all of a sudden there's a team of people that are affecting. And they start getting customers and they start serving those customers and they start changing their lives. And every single one of the people that are sitting there, if we can touch them and affect them the right way, it's a ripple effect that will go through tens of thousands and in some cases millions of people. So we've got 4,200 of them and if we serve them at the right level from the very second they come in all the way to the end, we can affect literally tens of millions of people from this weekend. If you look at it, probably half of them are people who have come before in the past. And for them, this is like a big, huge family reunion. You will see that when they show up, it's like, they're going to be crying and hugging, you know, they're going to be like, they're going to be crying and hugging and this is going to be this most amazing thing in the world. And then the other half are people who are here for the first time and half of them are scared, they're nervous, some of them spent the last minute they had to come here, they came with a hope and a dream and not knowing what to do next. As excited as they are for all of our hardcore funnel hackers, we're going to be back. I'm mostly excited for this new group of people who, we really have a chance to change their lives. Come on, come on. But all of a sudden, done, that's the only thing that matters. We are all going to be tired, I'm going to be beat up in the late nights, early mornings, a ton of stress, my voice will be completely shot by the time it's done, but that's okay because it's not about us at all. This is for them, like, it's a really big deal. And so from the top all the way down to the bottom, I'll make sure that we are always having a super focus on, like, the services we're trying to do for them. If we do that, it'll literally be the transformation point for a lot of these people in their lives. This is my mom's first time coming to any of our craziness. And last of all, we want to thank all of you guys for trusting in us, for having the belief, having the commitment to not just think about it, not just talk about it, not just dabble, but take the step. And to travel, to leave your homes, your families to come here and to learn and to grow. We had such an honor serving you guys over the last four days. We're grateful for you. Thanks again for everything you guys appreciate you, and we'll see you guys all next year. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
