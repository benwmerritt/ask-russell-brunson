Hey, this is Russell and today I've got four persuasion secrets to help you sell more of your stuff online, drive more traffic, make more money, and have a lot more fun. We're gonna jump over here to the screen. I'm gonna show you guys four clips from a presentation I did at Funnel Hacking Live called Persuasion Secrets. I did have this presentation myself. The second half was done by Mr. Myron Golden and today I'm gonna give you my half. And if you've enjoyed this part one of Persuasion Secrets, let me know in the comments down below. We'll give you part two next week to go through all of Myron's Persuasion Secrets. All right, so principle number one is called social compliance. This is one of my favorite ways to sell more on your webinars, your live events, anywhere you're trying to sell more. Learning how to use social compliance will change everything for you. With that said, let's jump in the first clip about social compliance from Funnel Hacking Live. First principle I'm gonna talk about when you are persuading people is a principle called social compliance. Here's never heard of that before. Okay, to begin with, I'm actually gonna show really quick. It's like a minute long trailer for a movie. It's a documentary on Netflix called The Push. Who here has ever seen The Push before? Okay, to set this up, this documentary is crazy. This is your assigned homework for the next week. Go home and watch this. But basically it was a social experiment to see if they could get somebody they'd met brand new and within a 90 minute window get that person to push somebody off of a building to their death. Could they actually do that? It's like there's no way that's not possible. But as you watch the documentary, the four people they took through it, three of the four people thought they were pushing somebody to their death within 90 minutes of the experiment starting. And so I want to show you guys this documentary just because it's kind of creepy, kind of evil, but also there's some really cool principles we're talking about. So let's cube that documentary trailer right now. Chris is enmeshed in a web of lies and that's important. I need him to feel like there's only one way out when he's told to commit murder. My name is Derren Brown and the question we're considering is simple. Can we be manipulated through social pressure to commit murder? 70 people coming in here. They can't see this. Taken by the knees. 70 actors will be playing out a meticulously planned and rehearsed scenario to manipulate this man who has no idea he's being filmed. Come on guys, what are we gonna do? He's a millionaire, he's gonna make sure you go to jail. This show is about how readily we hand over authorship of our lives every day. Just giving one big push. Can social compliance be used to make someone push a living, breathing human being to their death? Welcome to the push. Whoa! So everyone's like, do we clap? That's not normal. All right, so obviously my goal is not to get any of you guys to push somebody to their death in 90 minutes of period time. But there are many times in my life where I need to use compliance and things like that to get somebody to run to the back of the room to buy my product, to buy my service. And so there's interesting things that by watching that documentary when you don't look at it through the evil side but through the just like how can you use this as a persuasion technique that are really powerful. So I remember when I spoke at the very first 10x event, one that had 9,000 people in the room in the Mandalay Bay. And my goal was to set the record for the most sales in 90 minute period of time. And I'm like, how do I get people? This is a huge audience. The stadium was like, it was just so big. It was hard. Like how do you get rapport and persuasion? And how do you connect with people that are like from all over the place in this huge stadium? And one of the things that I learned from watching this documentary was all about getting people to make these little micro commitments. Commitments and consistency. Commitments and consistency. Right? They didn't walk up to the person the very first time and say, hey, go push this person off the building because they would have said no. Instead what they had to do is like little things. And so I thought, okay, how what's the first thing I can do to get everybody as a whole as a group to do a little thing? I'm going to do an ask. It's going to get everybody to say yes to that. And that'll be the very first ask. And then I'll go to the next and the next. Okay. So those of you guys who had a chance to watch my presentation at 10x, what was the very first thing I did to build social compliance? Who here knows? I had everybody pulled their phone out. I said, everybody pull your phone out. Every year thing. And suddenly within 30 seconds, I had 9,000 people in the room all mirror and matching me all with the same phone. And I asked them to do something. They said, yes, I got people moving it around and we were mirroring and matching and everything was connected. Now I put it away and I already had this connection immediately with the audience where now we were connected as opposed to typically it's like, oh, there's this person on stage. They're very disconnected and things like that. And so by doing that, I asked a little commitment and then I asked for another commitment and another commitment. By the time I got to the end, it wasn't crazy for me to ask for a commitment for them to go run and spend $3,000 for an account for ClickFunnels. Does that make sense? And so for all of you guys, you can weave these social compliance things into anything you're doing. Just think about in the last, how long have we been going? A day and a half here at Funnel Hockey Live, I've asked you guys do a lot of things. We had you guys stand up, we had you sit down, we had you do different things. Right? I'm trying to build a rapport so that you guys will be able to move with me, be able to connect with me and move throughout the entire event. And so that's principle number one is this insanely cool concept of social compliance and how to use it and weave it into all your presentations. And it works just as well on a webinar. That's why in webinars, I'm like, who here? Tell me what city you're from. And suddenly everyone's like, you see the chats blow up with a thousand people telling you what cities they're from, right? Like they're social compliance. Awesome. Who here came the furthest? Like who's excited to be here? Tell me your things. And people are complying, they're filling out the chat, they're moving and they're having them do things, right? By doing that, you're creating these little micro commitments that lead up to bigger commitments. And so there's principle number one is social compliance. All right, we're going to think about principle number one. G is like that. Now principle number two was Myron's. I will share that on persuasion secrets number two. If you guys like this video, let me know in the comments down below. I'm going to jump right now into principle number three, which is called trial closes. This is one of my favorite concepts to get people to buy more of your stuff. In fact, I did a whole YouTube video about this a little while ago. You guys kind of went crazy about it. So I want to show you guys the next persuasion secret, which is called trial closes. Okay, number three principle. This is one that I learned from a guy named Ted Thomas and Ted is one of the best stage presenters like ever. And I remember when I was first learning speaking, I heard people talk about him. In fact, his nickname, they called him the Pied Piper of closing. And they said, what would happen is you'd see like the Pied Piper would be like walking and all the things are falling. It's like same thing. You see him at his presentations, he'd get everybody pulled their credit card out of the wall and and then he'd get people and if you go to YouTube and type in Ted Thomas Pied Piper, there's videos of this where he's got his credit card and he's walking and there's a line of four or 500 people walking around, holding their credit cards. He's walking them to the back of the room, right? The guy's famous for this. I was like, anyway, so I've been watching him. I've been studying if I'm learning some stuff, but never actually met him in person. And one day I'm speaking this event and I'm sitting there in the room. There's probably maybe 200 people in the room and all of a sudden I see it. Ted Thomas walks through the back door and sits in the audience and I was like, that's the dude who's really good at closing and I'm trying to sell. Like I just kind of freaked out for a second. I'm like, okay, no, I think he's not here. So I did my whole, my best to do my pitch and I did, I closed pretty well. People ran the back and then signed up and then and then after that he kind of lingered in the back of the room as I'm closing cells and stuff. And I'm like, oh man, like and finally everyone left and it's just him and me and he's like, hey man, that's a great presentation. Can I take you to lunch? I was like, sure, let's go to lunch. And so he takes me to lunch and at lunch he starts asking me all these questions, making me feel like I'm super fascinating. He's asking me question after question after question after question. And I'm like, this is so cool. And then he stopped. He said, hey Russ, look at your head right now. And I'm like, what are you talking about? He's like, look at your head. What's happening? He's like, see what's happening in your head? I'm like, what happened? He's like, I got you to say, I got you to nod your head. He's like, you've been nodding your head about five minutes right now. I'm like, okay. He's like, I need to teach you something that's going to change your speaking career forever. He said, when I was in the back of the room, he's like, you did a great presentation. You did all the things. But I was watching the heads of the audience and everyone's head just sat there. Nobody's head was moving. He's like, the reason why is because the only time you tried to sell me something was at the very end. The only time the first time you asked me for like, you know, for something was towards the very end, he said, if you watch the way that I speak, he said, I do these things called trial closes. Like I was just doing to you. He said, what a trial closes. I asked you a quick question, like a yes or no question, where you answer yes. And he asked another question, the answer, yes. He said, if you watch me at the back of the room, if I'm on stage in the back of the room, did you see a see a people whose heads are going like this for 90 minutes? They said, yes, thousands of times before I ever asked them to take out their credit card. And I was like, that's fascinating. How does this work? He said, okay, this is what you need to do. He's like, you got to start weaving in these trial codes that all throughout your presentation. Right. So he said, you say something, say, you guys getting this? Does that make sense? How awesome is that? People are like, yes, yes, yes. And you keep doing that. Keep weaving in as many times as you can. So I remember after he told me that I was trying to think of like where I could put trial closes into what I was doing. And at the time I had an automated webinar that was doing really, really good. In fact, I remember to this day, we were making $9.50 for every person registered for the webinar. And so I got home, I took that webinar and I got it all transcribed and I figured out trial closes I could put throughout the entire webinar, probably a hundred of them. So I wrote out these trial closes. I recorded myself just saying the trial clothes. Like, you guys getting this? Is this amazing? How many of us wish this was you? Can you see yourself doing this? Etc. Etc. I recorded those and had my brother take the video file and just weave in the trial closes. Like I didn't change the rest of the webinar. I'm just weaving in the trial closes to that presentation. We put it back live and we relaunched it. And we went from making $9.50 per registrant to $16.40 per registrant just by adding in these trial closes. Okay. Now, first it's going to feel weird because you're going to be like feeling awkward trying to get people to say yes. But what I learned initially was I started getting these little sticky notes and I would write out different trial closes and I would stick them all over my monitor on my computer. And when I would do a webinar, I would talk about something and I'd see one and be like, oh, you guys getting this? I'd see another one like, oh, does this make sense? Can you imagine yourself doing this? Can you like, wouldn't that be cool to be able to do with that person? Like, would that change your life forever? Like, yes, yes, yes, yes. I started getting better and better at that. But you probably noticed when I speak in a traditional event, I probably asked you guys 5,000 questions in the hour I speak, even I'm not selling something because I'm trying to get, again, commitment, consistency, compliance. And you guys saying yes over and over and over again. So trial closes is one of the most powerful things you can start learning and mastering and weaving into everything you're doing from Facebook lives, Instagram, YouTube, your podcast episodes. Like I want people not even to head wherever they're at. Even on webinars, I'll be on a webinar. I'm like, I know you're out there somewhere. Like, I know I can't see you. I want you to nod your head. Yes. I tell me yes. You can see it's like shake head up and down. I'm getting them in this yes state, this yes momentum. So by the end of time when asking for money, they're so used to saying yes. So that's the principle of trial closes. All right, welcome back. I skip principle number four. Again, I'm going to show that during persuasion secret number two. When Meyer Golden teaches that principle, I'm going to jump into my number five principle, which is called kind of like bridges. This is one of the secrets to simplify your communication. So then more people will buy from you with that. So let's jump right into the clip about kind of like bridges right now. Okay, the next one is one of my favorites because so many of us who are speaking about the topic that we love, one of the things we want to do is we want to show the rest of the world how smart we are, right? Which is the worst way to persuade somebody. We think that like, oh, by being more scholarly and putting on a hat and being able to use big words, people are going to think I'm very, very smart. What actually happens is it distances you from the audience, right? They're like, oh, this person's using big words. I don't understand half the things they're saying and it separates you. Okay, so for me, if you notice, like I always want my communication to be simple at everybody's level. So it doesn't matter how old you are, how like everybody can understand the things that I'm saying. I remember back, man, this is however many years ago, during the before Trump was president when they were doing all the primaries and stuff and they did a test, I think one of the new stations that a test, they took every one of the people that were running on the Republican card and they ran their presentation through like a test to see like what age like what grade level they're all speaking at. And the typical politician was speaking like a seventh or eighth grade level, which may seem kind of low, whatever, but they were on Trump's back and it was at a fourth grade level. Okay, and it's interesting because when you're trying to persuade people, if you're talking at a seventh grade level or a tenth grade level or you know, college level, you're not going to persuade them. You confuse them. They think they're dumb. They're going to think and they're going to separate away. You got to be speaking at a second or a third grade level. Okay, that is the key through all sorts of communication. So what happens though is there's times in our communication where we're selling something, we're talking about it, we're trying to teach something where we have to use a word that's complicated, right? A bigger word. And so what I do is every time I come to a word, that's kind of complicated. Like for example, when I was doing working with Trubit, when they first launched, we were helping them write the scripts and the pitches. And it was interesting because everyone in that in that business, they use very techno, they techno jargon, right? They use words like ketosis and ketones and glucose and all these things that that you may think, oh, everyone knows what that is. It's not true. Like I've been in that business, helping them for almost a decade now. I still don't know the difference in glucose and ketone. I don't know what those things even mean, right? Like, but they assume that everybody knows they start throwing this jargon and like, you're trying to close somebody on this thing and you're using this jargon and assuming they know what it is and they don't. Okay, so what I do, I use this thing called the kind of like bridge and what the kind of like bridge is, is you basically, every time that there's a word, let's say this is a word right here, I'm gonna use a really confusing word, and it could be funnels, it could be ketones, it could be whatever. So let's say it's ketones. I got to realize that like, most of the audience has no idea what a ketone actually is and they do, they're probably already bought the product service anyway. So the people I'm trying to persuade don't know what that is yet. So as soon as I say the word ketones, I have to stop and say, it's kind of like, and I tell them a story that's going to bridge the gap for something they do understand. Okay, so it's kind of, it's a ketone, it's kind of like, so I draw this bridge backwards, right, it's going this direction, and I explain something that they do understand that they already have context for. So like when I wrote the sales, the sales video for, for Prove It, one of the things I said, I talked about ketones, I said, in the script, I said, then you drink this stuff, you get these things in your body called ketones. Ketones are kind of like having a million motivational speakers who are running through your body, making you feel amazing. And people are like, oh, that sounds awesome. They don't know what ketones are, but they know what motivational speakers and a thousand rank your body, like, oh, that makes a lot of sense. Okay. And so anytime I'm speaking, I try to feel like, what are the words that are going to come over here, there's, there are going to be this wall that someone's assuming, some, as soon as somebody hears it, they don't understand that they feel dumb and they kind of start separating away from you. Okay. Every time that comes up, I got to stop and say, what's the kind of like bridge? One of my favorite, favorite people inside of my category Kings program, Ryan Lee and Brad Gibb, you guys hear somewhere probably, yeah, they hear somewhere, they were probably the best, well, they were probably the worst of this and now the best of this. When they first came into our world, they're selling financial planning, all these things and these words that were so big that I did like, I don't know what they're talking about. And they're like, but Russell, you have tons of money, you should bubble and they started dumping these words on me. And I was like, none of these words are English. Like, I don't know what you're saying. And like, but you're an educated person, you have tons of money. I'm like, yeah, I still don't understand the thing you're saying. And so they literally went back to their presentations and their, their webinars and they're speaking and they figured out kind of like bridges for every single principle, every single concept they have. And I watched them as they kind of struggled, they kind of struggled, they kind of struggled. They, they were some of the fastest from as soon as they, their message like clicked, they went from not having a success to two comic club, two comic club X and beyond in months versus decades. Like it was crazy. And when it came down to one of the core things was coming back and simplifying their communication. Instead of using these words, they assume everybody knows they use kind of like bridges every single time. So every time you're creating webinars, slides, Instagram, any time you use a word, you're like, somebody might not know this, just stop and like, it's kind of like this. They're going to build a funnel. It's kind of like this. And he explained something that they're going to make sense. It's kind of like bridges are so simple and so powerful. And it'll help you to build, pray, persuade people and move them to what you need them to do. So that is kind of like bridge. Welcome back. All right, I'll show you guys principle number six on the second persuasion video with Myron Golden. Don't worry. But before I jump into my last principle, which is emotional logic fear, I want to tell you guys one thing. If you want to learn how to sell more stuff online, I'm doing a live event here in the near future called selling online. If you go to selling online dot com or click on link down below, you go to their register, I give you three days going deep on persuasion and how to sell more stuff when you're on stage and webinars, presentations, video sales letters, wherever you're trying to sell, you learn how to sell more. Just go to selling online.com. Go get your ticket right now. And without said, I'm going to jump over to principle number seven. This is called emotion logic fear. These are three closes we use in everything we do from sales pages, the email sequences to retarget campaigns. It's one of the most powerful persuasion techniques you can learn. You can master without selling this jump over clip right now on principle number seven, motion logic and fear. This is one I could literally do a three day event on, but we do not have that much time. Unfortunately, I'm going to spend three or four minutes on it, which is going to be so much fun. So when I'm closing anybody, and this is true in all aspects of everything in, in webinars, tell seminars, sales pages, email sequences, retargeting campaigns, everything, there's three core things that I use to close them. Number one is emotion. Number two is logic. And number three is fear. Now I'm going to draw a picture of the human brain because the human brain looks kind of like, oh, I wish it was better like that ish. Yeah. And this is like the squirrely. Okay. The front of the human brain up here somewhere. This is our conscious mind, right? And our conscious mind, there's two things that are happening. One is called emotion and one is called logic. Okay. Back here's our subconscious mind and then down here somewhere is the lymphatic system, I believe, and back here is where we have fear. Now I did this whole thing at the unlock the secrets family event this summer with all the kids. I came out and we showed how this is an elephant. These are monkeys. This is a lizard. And we drew this big. It was so much fun. So your kids can explain this to you later if you need it to just asking about the monkeys, the elephants, they'll break it back down for you. But these are things that are happening in our brain every single day. And so every single one of us works off of different things. Some of you guys are very emotional. So it means very logical and some of you guys only buy or move based off fear. Okay. And so the a good way to explain these first ones, if I came out to you with a box of Twinkies and I showed you the Twinkies, how many of you guys are like, Oh my gosh, I want a Twinkie right now. Who am I? Twinkie. People want to tweak you right now. Okay. That's not a very big audience, which actually makes a lot of sense. Your kids are all freaked out, right? Because they see the Twinkie and emotion leads and like, Oh my gosh, I want that Twinkie so good. Okay. All of you guys in this room know what happened is you saw the Twinkie and also the logic kick and you're like, how many calories are going to be? How much sugar I'm having? Sugar crash? You start logically thinking through all the things, right? Okay. And we have this thing we're fighting between emotion logic, emotion logic. These two things are always battling back and forth. Okay. And so I'm giving a presentation. I got to speak to both these minds. Now, for the most part, emotion for me is a better thing to close with. So I will lead with emotion. It's my best thing. I'm going to lead with stories, emotion, get somebody emotionally to want to move. Okay. And there's going to be a segment of the audience that's going to move based on emotion. Okay. After I get the emotional buyers to say yes, then I have to transition to the logical buyers. People who logically need me to explain things so they can, uh, they can basically go back to their spouse and tell them logically why they bought it. Okay. We all know that people buy things emotionally. Um, like if you were to go buy a Ferrari, you sit in it or a Lamborghini, you sit and you're like, Oh, this would be so cool. You're driving around. Like this is amazing. I can feel so good. You pull up to the gas station and people are coming to you and you're like, this feels really, really good. And you drive back home and you tell your spouse like, Hey, I just bought a Ferrari. But the thing is it gets really good gas mileage. It has really high resell value, which is amazing. We logically justify it. Right. There's emotion. There's logic. And then the last one is fear. Okay. And to overcome fear, we use urgency and scarcity. So it's interesting. If you look at just this event, for example, how many of you guys bought your tickets last year's funnel hacking live? Cause you're like, This is amazing. I'm not going to miss this no matter what. Who are my people about last year? You're my most emotional buyers. Okay. Number two, how many of us were waiting? Like who's going to speak next year is going to be worth it? Like is Tony coming back? Who's going to be like, Oh, I'm going to wait and find out how many of you guys bought between between last year's funnel hacking live and maybe like three months ago, how many of you guys bought during that window of time? Okay. Very cool. So emotional logic. Now, did you guys know that almost 50% of our tickets are sold in the last three weeks? How many of you guys bought in the last three weeks? Oh, guess what took me to get you here? Fear. Fear of missing out. Urgency, scarcity, pulling things away. Okay. Now, if I only tried to sell with emotion or only tried to sell logic, only try to sell fear, I would not make as much money. So every sales argument has, I'm, I'm attacking emotion, logic, and fear. Okay. I do what I'm speaking at a webinar. I'm doing it on stage. If I have a, if I have a sales page, right, here's my sales page, the top one, third of my sales page, uses a video that's very, the driving towards the motion underneath the video, the users longer form copies, speaking to logic in the bottom. I have urgency and scarcity speaking towards the fear in a retargeting campaign. Guess what happens first? You hit my page, and you leave the first set of retargeting ads, all speaking towards the logic. Then we transition over or excuse me to motion. They would transition to logic and last ones in the campaigns, transition to fear. My email sequences, guess how they go? We lead with emotion. Then we go to logic and then we go to fear over and over and over and over again. And so for me, I'm attacking these three parts of the brain because these are things that either get you to move or to not move. And if I don't focus on all three of those I'm presenting, nobody's going to move. So there you go with emotion, logic, and fear. Crazy town. Let's give it up for Russell Brunster, y'all. Wow. Wow. Okay. Those are four of my persuasion secrets. We want the other four and then we'll learn what to do next. Follow me over here. I'm going to share with you guys the most important part of all. The first thing is understanding that this was just one half of the persuasion secrets presentation. The other half Myron Golden gave and he gave four other nuggets that were insanely cool. If you guys want me to share those as well, let me know in the comments down below. Let us know if you guys love Myron. He's one of the greatest presenters of all time. And on top of that, the last thing I want to share with you guys is the fact that there's a whole presentation I did here on YouTube about trial closes. I went deep for about 30 minutes on trial closes. You guys loved it. It was one of the highest viewed videos we've had in a long, long time. If you want to watch that as well, the links should be somewhere right here. Go check out that video right now and learn more about how to use trial closes to sell more inside of your business.
