Dad, what's going on? I could go to jail for that. This is the time that I almost lost it all. But like so many of life stories, sometimes you gotta lose everything before you can see what really matters most. It was 2008, 2009 when the recession started hitting for most companies around us. Not only was the recession not hurting us, it was actually doing really well for us. And we were thriving and having so much success. Hey, thanks for CC'ing me on that Patel email, Claire. Quick note, if you don't spell out the urgency in your emails, the reader won't take action. Makes sense. Thanks, Russell. Russell? Any thoughts on my latest copy, Russell? Looking good, Vince. But I think we should simplify the messaging on the sales page. Typically we had 40 or 50, maybe 60 guys who were on the phone all the time. Excuse me, Russell? Russell. Every credit card payment is failing. All the merchant accounts are frozen. And then literally overnight, we got all of our merchant accounts shut down. Just text Samuel from Empire. Their credit cards are frozen too. Everyone doing membership programs are shut down. What should we do? Hi, I'm calling about an account that's shut down. Are you kidding? No, we're completely legit. I don't understand. Why did you shut us down? No, but I told you already that we are completely legitimate and... No, I'm not raising my voice. I just... Please, I need you to back up for a second. What I'm trying to say is we do have the money and those accounts are... I know. Well, I told you. We are... They hung up. I don't know what's going on. And in that time, obviously we have these sales guys who get paid 100% commission. So when they make a sale with a camera and the credit card, they start panicking and thinking, you know, I can get paid. So people just quitting, not showing back up. And so everything starts kind of crumbling. So remember calling a meeting and bringing all of our employees in the room. Look, here's the deal. I know you guys have been working really hard the last two weeks. And I owe you money. And I'm going to take care of everyone. But right now we don't have enough money for next week's payroll. So what? You want us to work up for free, Russell? Look at the heck out of here. I'm worth more than that. Guys. During this time, I remember each day is like there's more bad news and more problems. It just gets heavier and heavier. And I remember specifically one day laying in bed, wishing that I had a boss so that they could fire me. Like I wanted out of it so bad. I'm not going in today. I can't face them again. What do you mean? You have to. Are you okay? How do I sell my employees again? Here's the dream. Here's the vision. Here's what we're going to do. And then we crash. And then I try to build them up again and we crash again. How do I do that again? How do I do that again? Come here. We need to pray. Remember she pulled me down and she said a prayer for me and for us. Blessing me to know what to do and what the next steps are. And like to lighten the burdens like it actually handled it. It was just like one of those moments was just powerful. It was the first time I think I'd open up to her and let her understand it. And I'm so grateful I did because we try to carry on burden ourselves sometimes and it makes it heavy. So there's a meetup with a bunch of marketers who had similar businesses as ours was happening in Vegas. And he corrected me. We were trying to have fun to take our mind off of our problems. And I remember I pulled my phone out to check my emails and there's an email from my dad at the very top. He basically said, hey, just so you know, I just got off the phone with Lindsay. We've been going through your books and she's like, she finally broke down and she admitted that she hasn't been paying payroll taxes. And asked her why, she said it's because we didn't have the money for the check. And finally she broke down and she had a whole drawer full of letters from the IRS. She was hiding, had penalties and fees and all sorts of stuff. It was getting worse and worse. And I said, I think at the time it was like it was over $250,000 we owed in payroll taxes. Dad, what's going on? You don't understand the severity of this. Not paying your payroll taxes means they'll find you. If you're unable to pay your payroll taxes, they'll throw you in jail. I could go to jail for that? Okay. And I was just like, I remember like sitting in this room and like fighting everything was spinning. And I remember the next day we were flying home, it didn't feel real. I walked into the call center where our sales team was and the entire sales floor was empty. Which in perspective typically had 40 or 50 maybe 60 guys who were on the phone all the time. And it's completely empty except for two people, Robbie and Randy. Hey Russ, I want you to know I am so grateful for everything you've done for us over the last couple of years. And all the guys, they're gone man and their deaths are all cleared out. I gotta look out for the guys I recruited and trained for you. And there's another call center down the road, Clancy's, and they offered us good positions. I mean, they've got great leads and they're paying the sales team really well. I gotta think about them and their families. In my head I'm like, I owe $250,000 debt to the IRS or I'm going to jail. And the thing that we have to generate cash just walked out on me. I wanted to stop and want to walk away and give up but I couldn't because if I did, now I knew I'd go to jail.
