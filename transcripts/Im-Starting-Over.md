Hey, it's been a little while. For those of you who know me, and those who don't, my name is Russell Brunson, and welcome to my YouTube channel. I've been doing this YouTube thing now for a while, actually about 10 years. So we first officially launched this channel. And back then, I didn't really know what we were going to be doing, and we made videos on a whole bunch of different things. We did vlogs, we did crazy things, we were traveling the world, we built companies, we talked about other businesses, we did interviews with amazing people, and it was a lot of fun. The channel is kind of all over the place, and now that I'm 10 years in, I kind of wanted to re-look at this. Like, what would this look like if we were to start over on YouTube? So recently, we delisted over 1,500 videos, and I wanted to start back at Ground 1 and just start with a conversation. If you've been following me for the last decade here on this channel, you know that most of the things I talked about were related to business or marketing or entrepreneurship. You watch as I grew my company from a startup into what is now known as ClickFunnels. You guys are users of ClickFunnels. Oh, so my message has been towards entrepreneurs about growing businesses, which I love. It's been so much fun. But I really wanted to focus more on, like, not so much like how to grow a business as much as I want to focus on you. As someone who's an entrepreneur or your creator or your startup person or someone who's trying to figure out how to get more in their life, more success, more happiness, more fulfillment. And it was interesting as I was going on this journey over the last 10 years. I had a chance multiple times to meet Tony Robbins and spend time with him. One thing that Tony says a lot, he says that if you look at any skill set, there's like the technical, here's how you do the skill. And then there's like the psychology, like the stuff between your ears and your brain that make you have success or not. He says that 20% of any activity is like 20% is the technique and 80% is the psychology. And so much what I've talked about on this channel is the techniques and the tactics. Here's how you do this and here's how you do this, which are all great. I want to continue to do those things, but honestly, I wanted to step back and I wanted to focus more on like, on just success as a whole. How do we have success? How do we figure out the psychology in our head to make us breakthrough so we can actually achieve the dreams and desires that we really want to do? And so that's kind of the game plan. So right now in my personal life, I actually started writing my next book. Don't worry, I'm not trying to sell it to you. In fact, it's going to be a year or two before it's done, but I'm in the research phase. I'm here in my laboratory reading and studying and testing things out. And I remember a little while ago, I had a chance to meet with Tony and I told him the name of the book. I'm working on my first book that's, that's around success and around these kinds of principles. As I get deeper into like studying this and learning, I'm learning there's all the parts of the book. And the title of the book is Secrets of Success. I'm so excited and so proud of it. And Tony Robbins is the biggest success coach on the planet. I thought for sure he'd like, this is amazing. Instead, Tony literally hated the title. Well, I like to play the seed with you on something. It's for you to consider. I don't know if it's right or not. Use the word success. I think it's a really outdated word. He told me a bit it. It sounded like something from the 80s. And I was born in the 80s. Maybe that's why I love it. But I love the word success. And so that maybe like the problem is just the connotation and people think, oh, those who were going for success, they're whatever. And so I wanted to, I wanted to create a new definition for success. And this is a definition that like, it gets me fired up and, and it's where I really want the, the theme of this entire YouTube channel to be. Success equals achievement plus fulfillment. So that's the equation. A lot of people think success is achievement or success is fulfillment. But it's not. They have to have both those things to actually be happy. Actually feel successful, right? Tony Robbins talks about, he says that there's two competing ideas. There's the science of achievement and the art of fulfillment. And so so many of us who are, especially people who are on YouTube or Instagram or listen to podcasts about success and trying to like figure out how to reach your dreams and stuff are so focused on the science of achievement. How do we achieve this? Like what are the step by step process? How do I get to that thing? But one thing Tony Robbins also said, he said that success without fulfillment is ultimate failure, ultimate failure. And I started thinking about that. And I've been doing this now for 20 years and I've seen so many people have insane amounts of success in their business, in their lives. Yet even though someone might make a million or a hundred million or a billion dollars or they win an Olympic gold medal or whatever these crazy achievements are, so many times they don't get fulfillment. They're not actually happy. And we see this in high suicide rates. You see depression. We see it in people who burn their entire life down to the ground after they achieve their greatest dreams and desires. The question is why? It's because they don't understand how to actually get fulfillment. And so success cannot be just achievement. Success has to be achievement plus fulfillment. How do we blend these two things together? Science is like a step by step process. You can grab a book like what's step one, what's step two and you see the process. So achievement is usually easier. Fulfillment is harder. That's why Tony calls it the art of fulfillment. It's an art project. There's not a step by step. In fact, if you did step by step art, it's not actually art. That's just you follow the guide. The magic in art is when you create something new. So how do you get that fulfillment? That's the stuff I want to explore. I want to talk about both myself personally because I'm someone who is driven by success all the time. I'm driven by achievement. If I can't be fulfilled, then what's the point of any of it? And so while this is partially a channel to help serve you guys, probably more selfishly, a channel for me to help answer these questions for myself. And so that's kind of the journey that I'm excited to go through. So what is fulfillment? How do we actually find that? Again, I don't know the answer yet, but probably the closest definition that I've heard so far was actually from Tom Billu. He said fulfillment is how you feel about yourself when you're all by yourself. This weekend, I actually had a chance where I was literally by myself. I've got a beautiful wife, five kids. I've got a company with almost 400 employees. I help coaches and wrestling team. There's very few times where I'm actually by myself other than my sneak in here to write and to read and to study. I had a really unique moment this weekend where I could sit there and think on this quote like fulfillment is how you feel about yourself when you're all by yourself. And I thought like, how do I feel about myself? I don't know if you've ever done that or taken the time. If not, I recommend taking some time and just thinking about that. And I remember as I sat there thinking, there were some things where I was like, yeah, like Russell, I'm so proud of you. You did that. You're doing this. Oh, you're great. Father, you're great. And there's things that I was so proud of myself. I was like, yeah. But then when, if I was honest, there were things where I'm like, this part of my life's out of alignment with what I actually value, which I actually believe. Why is that? What's the purpose? Why am I not doing that? And I think so much of the, my goal to strive for achievement is to try to like cover up that pain and try to hide it as opposed to addressing it and figuring out like, how do I feel good about myself when I'm all by myself about all the different aspects of my life? So I don't know the answer yet, but that's the journey I'm going to be going on. That's the goal of this channel. I want to give you guys the science of achievement for all the things you want to accomplish in life. You want to be a world champion athlete. You want to be an Olympic gold medalist. Like if you want to be successful in sports, like I'm going to give you the tools, the techniques, the people, the resources to help you be more successful and achieve those things. If you want to be an entrepreneur and grow a big company, I'm going to help you with that. If you want to be someone who's got better relationships and marriages and like, I'm going to give you the things to help you achieve those goals. But more importantly is throughout those conversations, I want to weave in and bring in the things that will give you actually fulfillment. And so that's the game plan. So with that said, welcome to the brand new Russell Brunson channel. 10 years in the making, we are back from ground zero starting over here to serve you guys and help you to change your lives.
