What's up everybody? This is Russell. Welcome back to the show. I'm excited to be hanging out with you guys today. And right now I am in the middle of one of the heaviest seasons of our entire year here. We have Funnel Hacking Live happening in less than a week. Right now I've got 10 presentations I'm personally working on. It's late at night right now. I'm recording podcasts for you. And on top of that, At Funnel Hacking Live we're launching two new companies. We are doing a thousand other things. We just finished our song Align event literally today and a whole bunch of other stuff. And the number one question I get from so many people is Russell. How do you get so much stuff done? Sometimes they replace stuff with other words, crap or other things like that. But I'm gonna say stuff for the podcast and for the YouTube channel. But how do you get so much stuff done? And that's what I want to talk about because I feel like so many people are trying to do things and their wheels are always spinning. They're never quite getting things finished. Yet for me and for our company, we get a lot of things done. You probably noticed how many offers and funnels we've been up there. How much content, like how much stuff we're able to do with a very small team. And the question people ask all the time is how do you do it? So I'm gonna show you guys behind the scenes a little bit about today and hopefully give you some ideas and motivation and some just some frameworks to help you to get more things done and actually get things to the finish line. Right? Because how many of you guys have half built bridges, right? You've got this project over here and this project at four or five projects that are halfway done, but they're not finished yet. Right? How do we actually close those things? How do we get them done? And that's what I'm gonna show you guys today. And I think this will be very helpful for most of you, especially entrepreneurs like me and like you who have probably some sort of entrepreneurial ADD that keeps us from like focusing like how do you focus enough to finish so many things? Right? Because when all of a sudden done, you're not gonna remember in your business for the things you're creating, you'll be remembered for things you actually create, the things that are published, the things that get out there into the world. And so that's what I'm gonna talk about. It's one of the jokes we have internally. I can't remember. This is, man, probably five, six, eight years. I don't know, we start talking about this, but we talked about this joke of just like, what we get done in our company every single day is what normal companies get done in a year. So we always call them funnel years. So we're like, oh, three funnel years from now, blah, blah, blah, whatever the thing's gonna be done, right? Because when we get done in a day, most people, most companies, most businesses get done in a year. So how do you do that? How do you compress time? How do you get that much stuff done? And that's what I want to share with you guys. So that's what that's kind of concept. So I've got five or six points that are very, very important to understand, they help you to get these things done, right? And so before I go too deep into the actual principles, I want to share with you one of the stories, it was just one of the insights when I first got into this business was really powerful for me. Okay, again, you have to remember, like when I came into this world, I was a wrestler, you can tell from cauliflower ear, right? I'm a wrestler. I didn't, I had a C in my marketing class. I didn't have a degree in business. Like I wasn't, I barely graduated high school, barely graduated college, like with not the top of my class, I was the bottom of my class. I was a great wrestler. And that's what kept me going through college and stuff. I wanted to compete, but I wasn't great at listening. So when I started getting into business, it was weird because I started noticing a lot of the same frustrations I'd have in school, right? I'd be sitting there listening, I couldn't get things done. I was just, I was frustrated and I didn't know what to do. And I remember as it was one event, I used to go to a lot of events back then, because I was trying to figure this out. I tried to be in proximity with people who were having success because proximity is power. And, and so that was kind of the, the thoughts that I remember. One of these events, this guy spoke and his name is Alex Mandoz, just to me as they know Alex, just one of my early mentors, really smart guy. And he said something that was so powerful. He said, he said, Russell, you have to understand there's two types of people in this world. There's people who are great starters and there's people who are great finishers. Okay. There's starters and there's finishers. He said, you just figure out which one you are and then surround yourself with the others. And remember to think about that. And at the time I had a whole bunch of half built bridges. I had a whole bunch of projects or halfway done. And I was like, I'm really good at starting things. I love starting things. I get so much energy and excitement and like passion from the starting of a thing. How many of you guys are the same as that? How many of you guys are like the starters in your business, right? It's so much fun to have the idea and to brainstorm, to figure it out and get the logo design by the domain, start talking about things. But as you get further and further, at least for me, it's like further and further along the path, the less fun it gets, the less fun it gets. And then for me, the soon as like the project's done, like before I ever launched, like when the funnels, like the product's been done, the graphic design's done, the funnels finished, soon that's done for me personally, that's where I get bored. I'm like, okay, I'm done. I want to go create another funnel. Like I literally, as soon as like, and it's funny because for me, my business, like the only way my business actually makes money is everything happens after that point, right? Do we actually sell it? Do we continue to sell it? Do we grow it? Do we scale? Like, like those are the things where you actually make money. But for me, I'm a great starter. And, and I started realizing when I heard Alex say that like, man, I'm a really good starter, but I'm not, I'm not a great finisher. And he said, he said, you gotta figure out which one you are and then surround yourself with the others. And so for me, I started, started hiring people. When I started hiring people based on that, I wasn't hiring other starters. I didn't need another starter. I was starting more stuff than anybody ever should, right? But I needed finishers. One of the times I started realizing this is when I, again, I first got in this game, I started going to seminars and I was speaking to seminars. And back then I wasn't a smart, you know, I figured out a couple of things along the way. But every time I go to a seminar, I sit in the back, I'd be making my slides while I'm looking at other speakers and figure out what I was going to sell. I'd create a new offer literally every single time I was presented. So I get on stage and I would teach something and I would sell something and I would just be making up like, okay, and first you're going to get this and I'll give you this and how many of us want this? I'll throw in this. And so I started like making all these different promises, right? Because promises, people buy stuff, but then I didn't know how to fulfill those promises. And after I forgot about it until like a month later, two months later, someone who bought for me, they, what about the, what everything you promised? What about this? I'm like, oh, I forgot about that. I forgot about it. And like, I was just so good. I would drop so many different balls, right? And so when I started hiring people, one of the people I remember I first hired is Brent Copeters and Brent's still with me, but Brent used to come to these seminars with me and literally, I would have him sit in the back. I'm like, listen really carefully what I say. And every time I promise something, write it down so we can make sure I don't like, I don't forget to fulfill on the promises we're making, right? Just the basic thing. I wasn't out of like, I was trying to be a bad person. I just, I get so excited in the moment and then I would forget because again, I'm a good starter. Oh, it'll be fun. I'll do this. I'll do this. I'll do this. I forget what I had promised sometimes and then I didn't finish. And so Brent said that he was just captured like pay attention and all that stuff. And he'd be like, no, no, no, don't say that, please, whatever you do. But it gave me the chance to have somebody who started, like have all the lists. Let me go back and we can finish them together and get those things, right? And I started hiring more employees and more teammates over time. And the reality, if you look at like our business right now, there's probably one or two starters. I'd say Todd's a starter. I'm a starter. There's a handful of them. But the other, you know, three, 400 plus employees in the ClickFunnels Russell Universe, they're all amazing finishers. Like that's, I have to surround myself because I'm such a good starter. I've started so many things. In fact, it's interesting if I look at me as a coach, the reason why I love my inner circle and I love my Atlas group and things like that, like, I love starting things. And so people come to me, I can see in a heartbeat, oh, I would do this and like, I know exactly how to start how to launch it and get things out of the way. But most people don't come to me because they're like, Russell, how do you scale a business? How do you long term build and operating the, you know, the people like, I'm not, that's not my skill set. Now I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna starting business and launching, getting messages and noises out into the marketplace, right? And so anyway, so that's the first thing I'm saying for you guys is first looking internally and like, are you a starter, you're a finisher. Okay, if you want to get more stuff done, okay, if you are a great finisher, you need to find a starter to like start these projects, you can finish them. If you are a starter, you're gonna find some finishers to help you finish because it gets harder and harder for us to closer reach the finish line to actually finish if we're not finishers, if we're starters, because the first thing you're gonna do is you just fill the pain of getting towards that, your brain's gonna be like, I want to make something new, like give me something new. This is, I don't want to do this one is something fun and exciting and you want to like start a new thing to get out of pain because we get so much pleasure and happiness from the creation. Okay, so there's just kind of one caveat, one pre warning for you guys that you're trying to figure out how to get more stuff done. Okay, so that's number one. Number two, after you've figured that out, okay, and if you are, especially if you are the starter, the next thing is you have to have a vision, right? There's gonna be a vision for the thing you're creating. Why are you doing this? Like, what does that, what does that look like? What's this vision? For me, every time I start a new project, one of the very first things I do, because for me, I get this idea and it sits in my head. And I think everyone's got probably different order, different process. But for me, the way it works is it gets in my head and it's just like, it's kind of this like fuzzy idea, like having an idea like, ooh, we could sell something, you know, whatever, like, I've got an idea of something that we could create, right? And then for me, it's usually like, I got to figure out a domain, I got to buy a domain name tied to it, and I got to design a logo. Those are my next two steps for me before it can become real. It's got to be tangible. And for me to make it tangible, I got to have a domain name and a logo. Okay, I have literally, I would say, conservatively, probably three to 4,000 domains I bought and passed all of them tied to a great idea. So it's like an idea, I go buy a domain instantly, something secrets, like, you know, or something hacker or something, you know, it's all some version that for me. So that first thing I do for me is I'm buying a domain as quick as I can, right? Number two, I'm getting someone designed a logo, because then it's like, okay, now I've got something tangible. Now, I have something I can cast a vision around, right? So when I bring my team together, like, here's the vision, I show them the design, I talk about the name, and then it's easier for me to like, to share my vision. So that's just me personally, you may be different. But for me, those are the things I need to be able to share the vision. And then whenever I create a new project, the first thing I'm doing after I get the domain and I get the logo, I sit down and I literally sketch out the way I do with my team, because we're mostly remote now, is I have a remarkable, this is there right here. And I just go open and I can screencast it to my computer screen right here. And then I open up Camtasia or ScreenFlow or Ecamm Live or Loom or whatever you record something with, and I record myself doodling out. Okay, here's the first thing. And the second thing, I cast the vision so that everybody can see it. And for me, I like casting a vision in a way that's recorded for a couple of reasons. Number one, you should drive me crazy when I have a meeting. I bring everyone in and I cast the vision. Everyone gets excited and they go back and then like a week later they come back and now Russell, how does this work? I explain that again and it drives me crazy. I hate re-explaining my vision. I don't know if you guys, if you visionaries are similar, but I hate re-explaining my vision because I gave you my vision. I shouldn't have to re-explain the thing to you, right? And for me, it sucks energy and I can re-explain something. I'm like, can you not see what I see? And it's hard because for people who are non-visionaries, it's hard for you to see what you see, right? And it's frustrating, sorry for a visionary, it's hard because most people around you are probably non-visionaries. So it's frustrating for you and at least for me, it's frustrating when they have re-asking because I'm like, you don't understand, you're seeing the vision. And so it's nice to record it. A couple things. Number one, everybody hears the same message. Instead of me casting the vision in five different places, five different people, and I'm telling it differently every single time, I've recorded it once and they have it. That way when they have questions, they can go back to the vision video and be like, what was the vision on this again? Oh yeah, they can watch it, right? We'll be bringing somebody new in the project. I don't know if I catch them up to speed. I'm like, okay, go watch the vision video so you see the vision we're creating and then we can plug them in very, very quickly, okay? So I always capture a vision of every project we're going to do ahead of time in video format and then I can send out to the team. So then it goes out to the team and then for me, I've got somebody who's a great project manager. Now, it depends on which department or area of the business is in. Most, like the playground I play in are offers and funnels, right? That's my favorite. So the person on my team who's my project manager, she's amazing, her name is Morag. And Morag, what she does, she takes the vision video and she goes and watches it and she's like, okay, everyone's going to watch this video. But based on this, it's like, okay, so-and-so has got these five tasks from Russell. So-and-so has got these five. So-and-so has got these five. And so she's taking that and she's breaking down all the different pieces, right? Here are all the pieces that have to go into this vision. Okay? And what's nice about that is then everyone on my team, they can go watch the whole vision video. But minute one and then minute 14 and then it's 26. I talked to Jake, who's your own design. Then minute three and 17 and four, I talked to Nick, who's doing the funnel and like, you know, stuff like that. So she-so they're able to see the whole vision, but then they get from Morag, like, here's all the individual tasks that are for every single person. Does that make sense? Okay. So I cast the vision. Okay. Great starter. And then I finish her's going to take that and say, okay, what are all the pieces? Break them down. So project manager breaks down the pieces and then gives them to all the individual people, then to go and actually work on their pieces. And the project manager is in charge of then taking those pieces, plugging them together and putting all those pieces together. Okay. So, again, number one is figuring out your starter, your finisher and surrounding yourself with the other one. Number two is casting the vision. Number three is having your team kind of break out the pieces. And some of these are all kind of tied together because my next point I had on there is, is after you figure out what are all the pieces involved to get this thing done, right? Next is like, who are all the who's you need? Okay. And so for me right now, my team, obviously I've got a whole bunch of really great who's. Okay. And I say the word who's me as I've heard me talk about this. This is a Dan Sullivan concept that he kind of invented that he worked with Ben, with Dr. Ben Hardy to actually write a book called Who Not the How. And the concept behind this is that the reason why most people don't get things done is because they want to learn how to do it all, right? We're doers. We're, we know how to figure things out, right? I'm guessing that if you're here, you're probably one of those people, you just get stuff done, right? And so what happens is we start working on a project also, we hit something we don't know how to do. And then we do is we go try to figure out, okay, how do I do that? Right? How do I do it? So then you go down this learning loop, let me go learn how to do that. I'm going to learn how to do this, this, this, and you start learning how to do the thing. And then typically that how takes you into procrastination loop that maybe it delays you by a week or, you know, a day, a week, a month, a year, five years, whatever that thing is, right? Till you learn it and then you come back, you're okay, now I have the skill set. Now I'm not gonna do this. So you start going on the path again, you're going forward, you're going forward, and you get stuck again. You're like, Oh, I don't know how to do that. So you stop and go figure out how to do that. And then you go, and you start learning, you go down this other learning loop. And the problem we have as doers is we start going every single time we get stuck, we figure out how to do that, how to do that, how to do that. Every time we get to figure out the how, it takes us down this loop where it just, it takes us forever to get things done, right? And so what Dan Solvon's argument is, instead of saying, how do I do this? Every time you hit a roadblock, you stop and you never say how. Instead you say who. Who is the person that you know, or you can find who already knows how to do that, who can do it for you? Okay, so replacing the who not the how or the, yeah, it's replacing the how with the who. So again, the book's titled who not how. That's kind of concept. So the question I have for you is like, after you cast the vision, you broken down the pieces, who are all the who's you need? Okay. And somebody was like, well, I don't have any who's or else so I can't hire people and boom, I understand that. Like when I got started, guess how many who's I had? None. It was just me, right? But I didn't have all the skill sets. I was not a designer. I was not a programmer. I was not a copywriter. I was not, I wasn't all these things, right? And so I had to figure out who the who's are going to be able to do all these different pieces. Okay. And so for me, I started, I started meeting different people. And sometimes, again, at first, I couldn't afford anyone. So I was a college kid, newlywed, my wife's making 915 hour, I was making $0 an hour, I'm trying to build a business, right? So I had no money, I understand it. Okay, so instead, I'd use my resourcefulness, I had to find some of the great designers, hey, this is what I'm creating. You know, I can't pay you, but if you help me launch, I'll give you x percentage of anything we sell from this product, right? And I sold people and why they should partner with me, right? I sold, I sold designers, I sold programmers, I sold people into these projects. Okay, when I would make money in one project, I'd reinvest into another one, right? Like I literally, when I was trying to hire some programmers back in the day to create one of my very first products ever, I found out which was going to cost, I didn't have that much money. And so I remember I went and my buddy and I went and we bought tarps and rakes. And we walked around the neighborhood raking leaves for people, rake leaves, drove, you put in the back of a truck, threw them in the dump, got paid to rake the leaves. And then I took that money, I used to rake leaves, I sent it to Romania for my buddy Doral, Doral, I pay him and he would program things for me, right? And then that was the, that was the process, right? So I'm hustling to figure out how to get money to do a pay the hoos, right? It doesn't mean I have to like, my business has got to make X amounts so I can hire a hoos. It's like, no, like, figure out other ways to get money, right? Like, how can you get money from me was raking leaves, for you might be borrowing money, might be like, there could be a lot of ways, but figuring out how to get the money. So I got the money to pay for the hoos. Or again, I partnered with the hoos, I offer them equity, I offer them profit share, ref share, things like that, right? But, but for me to figure out how to do all the pieces that can take forever, okay? So instead, I got to figure out who are the hoos who already know how to do this, that then I can figure out how do I get them on board to be part of this project? Okay, when the, when the keys is like, cast the vision, here's the vision, right? I showed them the video, this is the vision I'm trying to create, it's going to be amazing. I got no money right now, but after we launch this, I'll give you 10% or I'll give you, you know, I'll pay you $2,000 for logo after it launches, if it's successful, like, you know, I'm hoping it will be, but I don't know for sure. And you're finding people I can negotiate with like that. Okay, so I get all the hoos. And then the last piece I had her here before I'd walk into some, the next portion of these is really understand like, why are you doing this? And this kind of comes back to the vision, like you're casting the vision, figure out the pieces, who are the hoos? But the big thing, when you start getting the right hoos on board, they want the vision of what they're creating, but they also want to know why they're doing it, right? What is the why? And you hear this talk, you know, here like Simon Sinek and people talk about like, what's the, what's your why? What's the, what's the reason behind your actually, you're actually doing this? And it seems cheesy, I think, but the reality is it's so important. It's so true. Like when you understand the why and cast the vision, people will follow you, they'll follow you to the end, to the ends of the earth. Some of you guys know over the last, man, two and a half, three years now, we're having a long spend, but I've been collecting these old books, right? And for a long time, people thought I was crazy, because Roya Rust is spending literally millions and millions of dollars to collect old books from people who have, you know, are no longer on the planet. And nobody can understand. And I was trying to explain it, nobody understood. And so I remember, we were about to go to this mass, to Mastramind in Paradise down in Mexico, with all my inter-circle, two CCX members, things like that. And so we're about to go down to, to Mexico. And I had an idea, like, what if I pitched everybody at Mastramind to be part of this project, they could put money into it, they could be part of this amazing thing. And I was like, I had this idea, like, what if we sold, you know, we, we offer people, they could buy it at a million dollars or a hundred thousand dollars, we had just, anyway, one of those things is like, this is an idea that doesn't make any sense. And probably everyone's gonna say no, but, but we should try it. And so before we went to Mexico, it's like two days before we're into Mexico, some of my team, you know, I was talking about some of my team, and they're like, well, we should cap, like, like this cap, should you explain why you want, like, why are you trying to build this? Because it still makes no sense to none of us, right? And so my team came and we went to the Napoleon Hill room, which is I've got a backdrop of my, my Napoleon Hill books and things like that, set the cameras and, and I remember Dan was there, he's like, so do you have a sales script? Do you have something? I'm like, no, but I just, I'm just going to tell people why I'm telling them why, like why I'm building this, like why am I like, like, it's Russell crazy, maybe, but this is why I'm doing this. This is why I'm literally investing tens, at this point, tens of millions dollars from my own pocket into this vision, right? And so I made this video and I explained the why behind it. And at the end, I said, you know, basically it's a million dollars. This is what it looks like. And I kind of explained the why and I did that. And remember I got done recording the video, it was one take, no editing, just one take all the way through. And the three or four guys in the room were just kind of staring at me. I was like, was it okay? And one of them was like, Oh my gosh, like, if I had a million dollars, I would give it to you right now. And then someone else was like, I finally understand like your vision, like why you've been buying all these books? I finally see what you see. And I explained the why, right? And then I go down to Mexico and I show that video. It's a 10, 15 minute video, explain the why behind what I'm doing, making them a million dollar offer. And then I came on stage afterwards and I explained it. And from that little presentation, initially we got commitments for 17 million dollars donated towards this cause. Is that crazy? All those didn't stick over long term stuff like that. We kept a lot of it, a couple of them fell through and things like that. But still insane, right? That I was able to raise 17 million dollars on a 15 minute video explaining my why. That was it, right? And then making a really good offer. So for you, it's like when you're casting this vision, like, why are you doing this? Why should they care? Why would they want to be part of it? And this comes down to again, if you're trying to figure out who are these who's you're going to be able to help with it, right? Like, if you're trying to recruit a who to be part of your project, you can't explain the why behind it, like why would they come? Like, so you want me to work for free so you can make something and sell it and make money, right? Who's going to be excited about that? Nobody. But if you got a reason why you're doing this, like, what is that? Like, why are you so passionate about it? Why are you putting in your own time and money and effort and everything you've got into this business or this project, this idea, like explain that and then people will line up to work with you, right? When we explain ClickFunnels and put it out there and people saw it, like it's crazy. People started coming from everywhere around the world to come work with us, to work for us, to like be part of the movement because we explain the why. And so figure out your why. Okay, so I'm kind of all, not that I'm all over the place, but I'm going through my bullet points. I'm skipping around a little bit just because I want to make sure I'm covering them all in my logical sequencing of events, which are different than my bullet and outline that I wrote before this. But first thing again is figuring out, are you a starter, you finisher and surrounding yourself with the other type of person? Number two is casting the vision. What is the vision of what it is you want to create, right? And get I do it through videos on my remarkable, okay? Number three would be, explaining in that vision your why. Like why are you actually doing this? Why should they care about it, right? Act through the why, then it's going and taking your vision and breaking out here, all the pieces that are involved to be able to make this vision become a reality. One of my favorite quotes, I can't remember where I heard this from, but I'm sure you guys know what it is. This is a famous thing, but they say, what's the best way to eat an elephant, right? And you look at this vision, like, whoa, that's a huge vision. Oh, it's awesome, bro. So how are we going to do that? What's the best way to eat an elephant? One bite at a time, right? That's what the pieces are. You're breaking down these pieces into all the different, like, here's the different bites you got to take to be able to actually eat the self. Right? So here's all the different pieces. So for me, it's more like taking my vision and project managing. Here's all the different pieces for our team to do. Yeah. And then if you don't have a team yet, then it's figuring out who are all the who's you need to actually get those pieces done. So you can get done in the next three months versus next year, five years or 10 years, right? And one fun hiking lab, I remember the first time I ever explained this who not the how principle. And I was showing people this, this vision from like getting started to winning a two comic book board, right? And there's this big huge gap between those, those two things, right? I said, now to go from a beginner to winning two comic book board, the first thing you have to do is you have to go and you have to figure out a creative product, right? And so I show the timeline and then you're going, also you get spot right. Oh, how do you create a product? Well, I don't really know. And then it's like, maybe you got to go and you have to go study how to create a product, how to do product research, how to record a video, how to edit a video, how to like, and all the stuff, right? And it's like, on average, it's taking three or four months to master all that and create the content, right? So now you're on this path from, from startup to two comic book winner, right? You want this path, boom, to create a product, you figure out, and you get stuck with the, with the how it takes three or four months, then you get back on the path, okay, I'm gonna keep going now. It's like, now I got the past there, now I gotta figure out how to set up a website, how to build a funnel, how to write copy. And it's like every single step and we show this thing and like, when I took all these little pieces, like take three months to learn that, six months to learn that, you know, a year to learn that, we piece them all together, just all the, just all the skillsets you need to win a two comic book award, right? To be able to create an offer and launch it into the world, right? Copyright, drive and traffic, like all different pieces. We put them together, it's like 7.49 years, if I remember, I was like, how long the timeline was, if you want to go do this on your own, right? So that's the problems, we have this vision, it's like, if you need to get this all done by myself, it takes 7.49 years, if I actually like, line it back to back, right? If I'm actually strategic and I show how it actually, what it's going to look like, that's what most people can get stuff done. Okay, so instead of it to break that down and get it's coming back to the who's not the how. Okay, here's the five pieces, I can get so and so here, so and so here, so and so here, so and so here, they can all be working simultaneously, so they all come together once. And also now it takes it from 7.49 years, I can compress that down to three weeks. Okay, see how that works? Because I'm not trying to learn how to do all the things, I find the who's who already know how to do the thing, they can all be working simultaneously, because it's not me just doing all the pieces, the next piece, next piece, they don't have to learn it because they don't know how to do it. It's just I got to cast the vision, right, explain the why, figure out the pieces and then gather the who's. If I can do those pieces, I can compress time dramatically. It's the reason why we can launch companies and businesses and funnels so quickly, just because I've got the who's in place who can do things very, very quickly. Okay, but it took me years to get that. Okay, and I first started launching because I had one designer I loved, I had one, you know, I had a right of copy because I couldn't ever afford copy. I had to learn copywriting. I had one programmer went so I had these five or six people every time I had a project I knew and I knew, okay, this person charges me 300 bucks for a logo, this person charges me X and I knew what those things were. So whenever I had ideas like, hey, cost me $1500 to get all the pieces down or whatever it was going to be, right? But I knew that so I go make the money, come back. Okay, guys, here's the vision. Here's everyone's payment for the thing. Let's go build this thing, right? And that's what I would do. Okay, so those are some the first set of components. I want to talk about there's two big things and these are the pieces I think drive the like the reason why I get so much stuff done and these are the pieces that are missing from most people when they're trying to figure this out. Okay, and I was lucky when I went to my the man the second seminar I ever spoke I was a Carl Gillespie event in Las Vegas, went down to this event. And again, I went and I presented and I pitched I think I sold six people a thousand bucks a piece for my offer. So I was like pretty excited. And then I remember watching the speakers one of the speakers was John Carleton is one of the greatest copywriters of all time. And John's other speaking about copywriting, I was like, I knew that copy was the thing that I was struggling with the most I needed to learn because it was too expensive to hire copywriters at the time. They didn't have AI, they didn't have funnel scripts, they didn't have any things like, and I was like of all the pieces I could hire designer for a couple hundred bucks, I can hire people here but like the copy was like the most expensive. In fact, I remember trying to hire Michael Ford and he quoted eight grand was like eight grand like for some words on a page it made no sense to me right so I have to learn this. So Carlton was selling the course was $2,000 and we're buying the course getting home I started going through all the materials and the learning and everything and in that course there's a little tiny tape on the tape. It was it was Gary Halbert and Michael Fortin talking about copywriting. And so I'm listening to my cassette player my headphones in I'm listening to these guys talk about copy. And I still remember Halbert was talking and he doesn't know Halbert he's you know his name game was the Prince of Print and he was like one of the greatest of all times he passed away a couple years ago I had a chance to interview him once about a year before it passed away which was you know for me like insane on him as a college kid I'm interviewing the Prince of Print like it was it was crazy. Anyway I'm listening to this podcast or this this tape between these guys and Halbert shares the story and I'm gonna share the story with you. I want to I want to caveat it with I've shared the story at some of my bigger events and one time I had three or four people who got very offended by it so you may get offended by this if you get offended by it I think you're dumb because this makes no sense why it should be offensive this is a story that illustrates the point and it's not I don't know if it's true or not true it doesn't even matter if it's true it could be a parable for cry out loud so if you're gonna get offended I apologize in advance but that's kind of on you either way I'm gonna tell the story because it illustrates something and it changed my life when I heard it so this is how Halbert said in the in this I think it was called the scuttle but tapes was the name of the the tapes you better go try to find them on eBay but I'm listening to the tape and and Halbert talks about how he gets so much stuff done and he said you have to learn how to trick your mind into believing that if you're not successful you're going to die okay and this and then he goes on he says he says if you look at how the Mexican Mafia how they get things done right they go to the government like hey we need you to change the laws because if you do change the laws we're gonna make way more money right so the Mafia goes to government the government's like you know whoever the head of the government's like no like why would we do that this is the dumbest thing ever and so what happens is the next night the mob the mafia or the mobster whoever will go break into the house of the politician they'll sneak into the room and they'll wake up at night and they'll show them two options okay one option is lead a bullet boom okay the other is gold okay plato or plomo the letter the letter the gold okay those are two options and they come back to the politician like we need you to change a lot and if you and you've got two options but one if you do boom you get a bag of gold or silver right there's the there's the bribe or if you don't there's the bullet okay letter gold bribe or the bullet plato or plomo like there's a couple different versions right and and he says when you're kept when you're someone comes up to you in those two options either you're gonna get a bunch of money or you're gonna die you figure out how to change the law right when that when those are your only two choices he said the reason why most people aren't successful is because they're weak on their own mind right they set a deadline like oh I can change it oh it's not a hard deadline no one's like holding me accountable and they keep moving and they keep moving and keep letting this deadline shift and move and move and Halber said the reason why I'm so successful is because in my head I set a letter gold deadline either I'm gonna have this thing done by this date and if I do I get a bag of gold if I don't I'm gonna die letter gold like that was the mindset he had to have he said when I have when I shift to my mindset to be the letter goal on every single thing plato or plomo every single time I figured out a way to get done in time so after hearing that um again I was in college at the time we're hearing that I was like okay that's how you have success you've got to set these deadlines letter gold and so for me I started thinking like I started putting these projects together okay and this is the idea here's the vision here's the four or five people I'm gonna hire and then I would tell them before we got anything done I would set a launch date I'm like this is the day we're launching and at first people thought that was a movable date they did not know what my mindset was it was letter gold these days do not change okay so we set a date December 13th or January whatever was we set a date this is the day we're launching and that's that everyone go and so someone's was designing someone's was doing the the webpage someone's was programming I'm writing copy and we're all busting out getting our pieces put together and we get closer and closer to that deadline right getting closer and closer and people are like this is actually launching Thursday I'm like yeah like it's Wednesday morning I'm like I know we have to get this done like just so you know like we're not going to bed till this is done and then we pull all nighters like two nights and we're gonna get it all done in time just in time for next day we launch it and we launch it put out in the world and guess what happened boom we didn't die we got a bag of gold right so next project I said is the letter gold deadlines and so we start setting these letter gold deadlines every single time plot or plumber the bribe or the bullet like every single time and my team started starting to know me like when Russell sets a deadline like like that's the deadline nothing's changing we will hit that no matter what okay and if means one night we're not sleeping all night then we're not sleeping all night right means two or three nights like we're like whatever that is but that deadline does not move okay and that's how we started getting stuff done like that became the big secret okay and I started tricking my mind we're literally I was like we have to do this thing done right and so what happened as soon as I cast the vision and Denver told me how long that they thought things were gonna take then I would set the deadline and then for me I didn't want to make these deadlines soft because then you know human beings are like we're wusses we're like oh we're gonna change things and move things around I was like no if I set the deadline I gotta set this so I would set the deadline and then I would set up a JV page and you know all my my affiliates and partners like this was launching on June 13th at 6 p.m. da da da it's like everyone doing like getting your calendars so everyone is gonna promote this thing they have the calendars I mean it had to be done or else I was gonna lose tons of money right and then I would tell my team that we'd reverse engineer and then boom we'd all go to work and we hit every single one of our letter gold deadlines okay and this is the reason why a lot of people don't get stuff done okay they have this um they have this philosophy um one of my mentors Matt Fury used to always say you call it the maniana principle we get something oh I'll do maniana oh I'll do maniana oh maniana right he said as soon as maniana tomorrow comes guess what then you're like oh I'll do maniana because like maniana always is pushed out to the next tomorrow the next tomorrow the next tomorrow right and that's the most people do they just keep like punting the ball down the field down the field down the field not actually getting the thing done and that's the problem okay the reason I get stuff done is because I have a letter gold deadline I can look at my calendar right now you just can't see it from where you're right now but I have a calendar and on my calendar has every it's a big huge wall calendar right so I see jan refair my marks the scola dates and I have big in marker all my letter gold deadlines right um I can see them right here like funnel hacking live letter gold deadline I can see uh product launch there product launch there new offer launching there like they are hard coded in marker on my wall okay and that marker is it's not it's it's magic marker but it's letter gold like it is stuck on there okay and we will hit that I'm gonna hit it my team's gonna we all know it's gonna happen we do not miss our deadlines okay you're gonna stop letting yourself off the hook just stop looking for tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow right like you set a date and then you do not deviate from that date if you deviate from that date okay boom you die you have to trick your mind like I literally tricked my mind like my wife would have sometimes uh it'd be like you know six a.m. I had something three days and she's like you need to come to bed I'm like I can't I can't she's like why am I and consciously obviously I know like well I could come to bed and we could move things but you know but in my mind I'm like I will die like we set this goal like it like I have to hit this and I got so good at tricking my mind that like everything bended to my will because of that do you make sense whereas most of us are letting ourselves off the hook all the time on our deadlines and he's getting pushed down and pushed down and pushed down all right I have people all the time in my inner circle they come to the scene we call decade and day but they come out here we sit down and I have a chance to like spend time every single person in your circle I asked them we're working on we set a plan and then the last thing you can ask them like so what when's this launching and they go what I'm like when's it launching and they're like uh uh like you you want me I'm like yeah accountability you got to pick a date right now okay uh in two weeks not okay done like in two weeks I make my assistant follow up like they gotta make sure they do it right like quit letting yourself off the hook like pick a deadline pick a date do not let it bypass that's how you win okay letter gold so that's the next phase letter gold deadline okay okay now this is what's gonna happen this is the last step here in my little process my framework for yesterday um you set the letter gold deadline you start working towards that right you're working towards you're working towards it now it doesn't matter if I give myself two weeks or two months or two years okay when I get to the deadline all the work will compress and compress and compress and usually I'm always gonna pull it all night or night before okay it doesn't matter how far out I plan so I might as well do two weeks now instead of two months from now because either way I'm gonna be up till midnight or two or three in the morning night before because that's just how things work right we have all these tasks that seem easy to do as we get closer and closer and closer to this letter gold deadline right as we get closer to that like it's like I can't go this thing's done I can't do this thing's done then your brain is gonna want to go push the deadline okay that's your brain being weak you do not allow your brain to push the deadline it's not how it works okay instead what you do okay you start looking at all the different tasks okay remember when we set the vision we broke it here's all the tasks we gotta get done okay now you do that there's always two types of tasks there's tasks that have to get that they have to be done for the project to go on okay I call these straight line tasks these are the things like like these have to happen or else the things are gonna fall apart right okay but then for like all these other tasks they're like nice to have like oh we'll make it look awesome if we do this and we can do this and we can do this and we can do this right okay so they're beginning of the project we know like here's all the straight lines like these are things that have to happen for this like if any one of these six things don't happen the thing falls apart right if I don't have a product gonna fall apart if I'm funnel not gonna it's gonna fall apart if I have a payment processing gonna fall apart if I don't have traffic it's gonna fall apart like whatever those those five or six core things are the straight line those the ones you have to have for the project to happen those you cannot deviate from you just put more emphasis and more priority on those and then you have all the nice to have okay and this is what happens for me okay I get closer and closer and closer and closer to the deadline as they get closer I'm like holy crap we're not gonna make it okay and this is where people try to push the deadline no no no don't let her gold not gonna happen you do not push the deadline instead you're looking at all the tasks okay all right well I wish I had chance to write all the pre-email sequence I don't so that's gonna that's nice to have I'm right that does not happen I don't have to have that to launch okay and then like oh man I wish we had more designs and stuff like that but you know we don't have to launch I wish we had this I wish we had this and so I start cutting out all the nice to have is like closer and closer and closer okay but I stick to the straight line the things that I have to have I do not deviate from those I do not push the deadline but I get rid of all the nice halves because if we get closer and closer and closer things just kind of fall where you can't get everything done ever I've never had a chance we're like we got everything done just in time for launch not once in two and a half decades of playing this game okay it's not gonna happen okay I think about in sports I'm the same way in sports like I'm in training in practice in training in practice I get closer and closer to the match okay nice thing about sports is like when they set the schedule for the year those are letter gold deadlines that match is happening I'm competing against this to this school this team this whatever on those days no matter what the tournament's not moving for me if I'm not ready right and so I'm like I always need to do to get perfected for the tournament it's like a closer and closer like I'm not going to make it what are things they have to do to compete okay as a combat athlete what do I have to do I have to make weight okay so I have to wait I have to lose you know 20 pounds to be on the scale by Thursday at whatever weigh-ins are or I do not get to compete so like that's a non-negotiable okay like that has to happen like and honestly for you know I have to win my rest of my team okay those if I don't do those two things I do not get a wrestle so those are the straight lines I have to have everything else is nice to have right like getting a better shape in your cardio getting your muscles like doing the drill like those things are all great but they're they're they're nice to have okay not to have to have okay if I do not make weight on the day I do not get a wrestle okay so those are the straight lines for me if I'm launching a project on next Thursday what are things that have to have happened for people to actually buy okay um and so those are the things I'm thinking through like what's the straight line and as you get closer and closer and closer all the nice halves are gonna fall apart fall apart fall apart you can hit the deadline you launch it and after it launches then you come back to okay what are the nice to have so we didn't finish and now we start weaving those and we start backfilling those after the project goes live okay and that's how we play the game um that's why I get so much stuff done okay from the outside I don't know what it looks like to you guys but internally it is a mess every single time everyone's going crazy deadlines happening we're all cranking we're you know everyone's working on things last minute right we can't get that done that done up this doesn't happen another social posted none of this is done none of this doesn't matter we're launching the webinar boom webinar launches we make a bunch of sales sales are coming in it's like sweet made sales okay we've got 30 seconds to breathe now it's backfill go get the social campaigns figure out go get this go get this go get this we start plugging it in plugging in plugging in and now we get those things done in the future okay we do not move from our letter gold deadline that is the key that's what most people are struggling on is they keep letting the thing move and move and move and move okay so when you ask me Russell how do you get so much stuff done those those are the things okay I know I'm a starter so I show myself with tons of finishers number two I cast a vision that everyone on my team can see they can report back to they can seek they can you know they get stuck in the process they forget they can go back and they go watch the video understand what the vision is what we were creating to understand the why we're doing behind it so you can get your bottom to the wise they can be motivated as well okay number three they we've broken down from the vision okay again all starters were great the vision okay if I had to finish now take that vision and say okay here's all the pieces that you need to get in place to be able to actually get this thing done and if you don't if you can't afford a finisher yet then you're gonna have to be both it's gonna be painful but you got to do it anyway okay for the first decade of my business it was me and so for the first decade I had to be the finisher I had to go take the big project and break it down I was not good at it okay but I didn't have any money so I couldn't hire somebody else to do right so it was me figuring out those things out okay and so you figure out what are all the different pieces after that the goal is to figure out who are all the who's who can help you with this okay again if you've got to go and try to relearn all the or learn all the different pieces to make this successful you'll probably not be successful so figuring out who are the people I gotta start gathering my adventures team I need the Hulk I need Iron Man I need you know Dr. Strange here's a lot of pieces of people I need and then figuring out how to either pay those people or partner with them or give them equity whatever it takes to give those people on your team okay after you've got them all figured out you find out from everyone how long it's gonna take okay you set a letter goal deadline you get everyone's buying on this and then you do not deviate it does not move then as you start marching towards that letter goal deadline right your folks you're on the straight line needs to have to happen for you to be able to actually launch okay as you get closer and closer and closer all nice halves are falling off falling off falling off falling off falling off falling off but you stick to the straight line till you get it done you launch it now it's out in the world then you come back and start weaving in all nice halves weaving in all nice halves okay and that's how you play the game okay now I want to tell you guys a real quick story to kind of wrap this up to show you the results of this okay because a lot of times you think the launch the putting the project out there that it's done so it's like you know and it's not it's like that's the beginning of the game okay so um man six months ago um uh I had a vision for a project and it was an event called Selling Online you guys probably heard it if you haven't go register for it we do it once a month it's amazing okay so Selling Online event cast the vision for my team every guy excited we saw the whole vision in two weeks okay we put together the whole thing so what do I do in two weeks so there's a lot of stuff right number one we like people to actually show up so step one create the funnel uh the funnel page the upsell sequence members area and we promoted it so we wrote some lists before I even created one presentation now this is a three-day event where I'm doing basically every single presentation okay so we launched it people are registering they're signing up and it's like cool people registering step one is done I don't know what to talk about okay well all right that's step number two right so I'm going back like so I'm going back and I'm killing myself getting all the like I know that like for me to be successful like we do the entire event but there is an offer in the event right so I know that of all the pieces like there's a lot of nice halves all the presentations would be nice to have but the one that has to happen for us to actually make money is the selling presentation so my next piece like straight line webinar registration page right drive traffic straight line number one register m2 registration page straight line number three I have to have a webinar it's going to sell so I focus all my effort for a week on creating the one presentation that's going to convert people and get them to buy create that presentation right now we've got pieces worst case scenario people registered went through the funnel they go through a three-day event I got the one presentation right sell and then we got the offer and the members are in the back end right so those pieces that had that happen for the event to work okay so we have those pieces done then it's like I sell another week cool my letter go deadlines a week away before the event actually starts now I can go try to stay find out the other presentations now so I'm doing presentation number one number two number three I'm trying to get all the other presentations done right I got close and closer so the event goes live guess what it's a three-day event I had everything done for day number one everything everything done for day number two and I had nothing done for day number three okay I ran out of time but the event went live so we launched the event I do day number one do day number two we make the offer people go buy day number three comes out and had an outline for a one of crate but I didn't have any slides done had nothing else so I got on stage and I was out of time but they were there right so I go through and I do the entire day number three just from an outline okay and luckily day number three crushed as well right and so that was the first event okay now what's happened all the biggest the biggest like the straight line the biggest blocks all got done right and they're all working now it's like what do we not get so our team afterwards has like we're all like oh we did it I can't believe that right okay like what what do we forget it's like oh we forgot the email sequence we forgot this we forgot this we ran out of time for this we like all the nice tabs right so it's okay let's do this event again in a month and let's go back through and this you know now we have the hard work's done right the four or five big rocks like we have a registration page we got a funnel we have the offer we have memberships like all things are done so now we're doing this round number two okay we've settled let it go deadlines happening in 30 days that's gonna happen again when we come back this time around what do we do we go back through and I have some time to plan day number three right we go back live again I do day number one again and this time I was like day number one was good I missed a couple pieces um I decided I'm gonna call Jones come in and teach one or two sessions and we move some things around right did the second time around right and the second time around we started thinking like how do we how do we get more people to show up to the webinar how do we get more things all the nice to have now we have time for those we'll launch the next version of it it did awesome okay then we come back 30 days later let's do this event again the nice thing is that all the major things are done most of the nice things nice to have done things are done but there's a lot of other pieces we're still missing so let's come back now we'll come back and add some more of the nicest the nice to have things right and we keep doing this month after month after month so check this out now I'm just looking at my stats right here so you can I'm not going to show them to you right now but I'll tell you what they are so I've done this event now one two three four five six six times this month was the seventh time we've run this event okay seven time we run this event each time make no tweaks make no changes tweaks and changes um based on those tweaks and changes we made from this last set of the event right because the event was all perfect now we're just tweaking so I literally tweaked 10 minutes of the event from that 10 minute tweak the nice to have thing that we finally figured out how to do uh we three xed ourselves three xed ourselves um do you hear me say that three x a lot of times I'm happy with a 20 percent conversion 30 percent increase in conversion we three xed ourselves on the one two three four five six seventh version of this event okay and that's a secret you guys I'll sorry I get some more stuff done okay we get it done and then we iterate and we iterate and we iterate and we iterate okay this event we've now mastered right we're gonna do it again next month and I got all the things in place it's gonna be easy for me to do because I know what the presentations are I know what they like all the all the nice to have all the halftimes are done we'll just keep tweaking and changing right we'll do this again next month and like I don't know who knows what the numbers will end to be in but I would say conservatively this this event will be a 30 40 million dollar year business just the just the event just by itself right but it comes from this process and so that's how we get stuff done now for me we're doing this on multiple projects at a time multiple businesses at a time you shouldn't do that you should focus on one but I want to show you like that's the process how we do these things right I think a lot of times the reason why we move our letter of gold deadlines because we think we got one shot like we got one shot it's gonna work it's not gonna work right we start thinking that way it it goes out there and then yes you got one shot but the route is in this game in this business we're playing the entrepreneurs are like you don't have one shot you got a shot and you got to get in the shot next month in the next month in the next month right we launched the click funnels we launched click phones a decade ago right I did a webinar I told you guys the story multiple times I did that live webinar live between 70 and 80 times over and over and over and over and over and over and over again tell us perfect right now I could have waited to that webinar I could have waited till it was perfect could have waited till I had a course could have waited till I had this could have waited could have waited could have waited I could have kept moving that line could move my I probably moved in there six months eight months year more right but what did I do I said a letter gold deadline for me is my friend saying can you speak in event this weekend I'm like okay he's like you need to sell a thousand dollar thing I don't have a thousand or things like we'll make a thousand dollar version of click phones and write a presentation okay what do I need like what are the like there's the letter goal I'm selling on Saturday it's Wednesday like what's the letter goal I have to have a presentation and an offer and an order form okay got order forms printed create a presentation made an offer letter goal deadline got there launched it did pretty good okay and then came back iterate next week did it as a webinar webinar to improve the product prove the product prove the product tell us amazing okay and so that's how we do it now the other reason why I do this way is because sometimes you go through a process hit letter gold you launch it and then it fails or doesn't do well right what's nice is that not only wasted two weeks or three weeks or a month on a project versus six months or a year for all you guys keep punting the deadline keep punting it punting it punting it right you waste six months eight months a year two years three years trying waiting and trying to think perfectly launch it and guess what it's not perfect anyway that's the problem right and then at that time you're out of time you're out of money you're stressed out of your mind because you never got the thing done that's the reason why right because you get punting it down the line instead you got to stop right settle that little deadline get it out there the best iteration launch it out to the world right cut it all nice halves and then version two now you start adding in some nice steps version three adding even more nice steps to eventually version four five six become flawless right for me version seven version seven's event three acts the money from the last version just by tweaking 10 minutes worth of stuff okay you guys getting this okay click funnels 10 million or sorry 100 million dollar your company off me doing one webinar 70 times in a row every time iterating iterating iterating iterating iterating till it was flawless okay I didn't wait that's the key right I get a lot of stuff done so I forgot which things are worth pursuing which things are worth iterating which things are worth becoming amazing like it's crazy we're looking at the click funnels journey the last decade of this business the majority of our volume and money came off of three funnels how many funnels have launched in the last decade it's it's definitely over a hundred maybe over two right that's why it's launched 200 different funnels because looking for the three right if I was waiting for six months for the one I would never have found the three right I gotta go through a lot of iterations till I find the winners right and if my letter goal deadline is so far away and keeps moving I'm never gonna get forced to figure out the things right I think that's what most people are missing okay I launched 100 funnels to find the three that are gonna do the volume if I'm launching one a year I'm not gonna make it okay unless you're lucky it's not people do you like you but it's rare it's it's on the backside of volume putting a lot of stuff out there okay a lot of content a lot of videos a lot of funnels a lot of offers and when you do that that's how you make your you give yourself a shot to win okay and so understanding how we get stuff done in fact it brings back to like the very the premise of click funnels initially right is the fact that prior to click funnels on our best it took us three months on average to build and launch one one funnel one offer right when click funnels came around we could do it in an hour um you know if I was going fast if you're going you know normal speed two or three days you can launch a really good funnel really good offering get it out there to the world and I remember one of my favorite stories trey lul came to click funnels and he joined my inner circle and I remember him telling me he's he's like I'm gonna launch a fun like click phone so easy I'm a lot of funnels every single week until it works I'm like if you had to go for it and I watched him week one launch a funnel week two new funnel week three week four right each week so let it go deadline right pick a new product you offer launch the boom boom boom I think it was like like number 11 I think was the funnel if I remember right funnel number 11 he launched was his flatline flashlight funnel which came the fastest grossing funnel of all time no one's beat it yet decade later things like 20 or 30 million dollars in six weeks right it's ridiculous like I didn't want to show that number because it's like could that happen to me no it's not gonna happen any of you guys like that's a freak thing that actually happened to that dude but it was crazy to watch it right but it came from consistency putting him out there right he had launched 11 funnels before he found the one that was the one who's gonna blow up for him okay click funnels we launched 100 funnels to find the three that built a company's done over a billion dollars in sales now right so that's my methodology that's how it works that's how I get someone to step down I hope that helps you guys get them going through fast number one figure out are you a starter are you a finisher figure that out and surround yourself with the other type number two what is the vision cast the vision seven sees it number three what is the why behind your vision let make sure that people understand why something you bought in number four what are all the pieces project manage all the pieces that make the vision possible number whatever we are five who are all the hoos you need to be able to help execute on that and figure out recruit those people and to get your vendors seems together after that pick in the letter gold date and do not deviate from that date at all and then as you get closer and closer and closer you pick the straight line all things you have to do to actually get launched and live and then from there you iterate over and over and over and over again you keep doing that until it stops working okay again event number seven I've got event number eight happened this month I'm gonna make a couple more tweaks if I can get a three x sales again three x conversion from 10 minutes week might do the same thing again next month maybe I only get a 50% if I do that this month 50% next month that's 100% in the last two like it is insane right the amount of volume anyway it's it's it gets crazy really fast okay but that's how we get stuff done hope that helps you guys appreciate you all thanks for listening to the podcast if
