## Transcript
I have a question for you. How many of you guys have ever tried to write a book? Now, all the things I've been doing in my business over the last two decades, the hardest, but yet the most rewarding, most fulfilling part of what I've done is writing books. I've written three great books, dotcom secrets, expert secrets, traffic secrets. Traffic secrets was the New York Times bestseller which I'm super proud of. And a couple years ago I started on my next book. All these books have been books about marketing, right? And I wanted to create a book more about personal development and success and how to achieve things in your life. And I've been trying to write this book now for almost four years and I've been struggling. And so recently over on Instagram and on TikTok, I started a really fun series, basically each day documenting the journey of me trying to write a bestselling book and hopefully selling a million copies. And it's been so much fun. Some of these videos have gotten over a million views or more and people keep loving them and asking for more, but they've been on shorts over on these other platforms. So I thought, how fun would it be to do to make a video right now? I'll walk you guys through the first seven days of everything I'm doing right now to write a bestselling book and hopefully selling a million copies. And I want you to let me know what you think about these. Let me know about your ideas. If you've ever written a book where you thought about writing a book or you have questions about writing a book, drop in the comments down below. I'm gonna be checking out these comments and tweaking the presentations in these videos as I move forward. But that said, here's day number one of writing a bestselling book and hopefully selling a million copies. Welcome to day number one of writing a bestselling book and hopefully selling a million copies. As of March 1st, 2021, it's been 1076 days. That's when I originally signed the contract. Payhouse, I tried this book two years, 11 months, and nine days ago. So the question is, why is today day number one? I've written three books now. One of them was New York Times bestseller. Only 0.4% of books ever sell more than 100,000 copies, which means all three of my first three books are in the 0.4% club, which is amazing. Only 0.003% ever sell a million copies by themselves. So if I'm gonna write a book, it's gonna sell a million copies. It cannot be good. It's gotta be great. The second book I wrote, I remember I had written about a hundred pages. I felt like the book was good, but it wasn't great. And so I literally went live on Snapchat and deleted the entire book from my computer in front of my entire audience. People were freaking out. People were like literally begging me to send them copies of what I'd written, but I wasn't proud of it. So I deleted it and started over. And this book has been the same thing. So let me show you what's been happening over here over the last two years, 11 months, and nine days. So here are the copies of the manuscripts I've written so far. If you scroll through here, you can see that there are 105 pages of writing and edits and doodles and notes and put a lot into this. What I got done is like, again, it's good, but not great. And as of today, I've decided that none of these is right. And so I'm gonna do something crazy. I'm literally highlighting all the manuscripts. And they're gone. And so today starts day number one, where I'm opening a brand new Google Doc. So the question is, why is this time gonna be different? Well, because it has been two years, 11 months, nine days, I am gonna hold myself accountable to you and to me by taking you on this journey. And so no more will I let resistance keep me finishing this book. So today was day number one on this writing journey. And I'm gonna be sharing the journey with you. So if you enjoy this, please subscribe, let people know about it, share it, comment in it. It should be a lot of fun. And I'm gonna take you on this journey, again, of writing your best-selling book and then hopefully selling a million copies. Good morning and welcome to day number two of writing a best-selling book and hopefully selling a million copies. So today, if I know the end goals of selling a million copies, I should look at people who've sold a million copies and get ideas about what they did and why they did it. Not just from the marketing standpoint, but from like how they actually wrote the book, how they structure the book, what they talked about. And so this morning I have been speed-reading four different books. The first one is, Girl, Wash Your Face by Rachel Hollis. It's my wife's book. In fact, this copy is actually signed by Rachel. Next I grabbed This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. This one is out over from Alcohol Addiction, sold multiple million copies. And third one is, Jordan Peterson, Beyond Ordered. I think Jordan's two books have sold over 10 million copies, which is crazy. So I wanna feel like, what do they know about writing books? Cause they're not marketers like me. They're not using free plus shipping funnels and stuff like that to sell books. They were just writing really good books and people pass on and get media and people share them and all sorts of stuff. So I'll try to feel like, how do they structure the books differently than how I've done in the past? And what's fascinating is I started going through, I sped read Girl, Wash Your Face, at least the introduction of the first chapter, see if I could pull out like, what is she doing differently than everybody else? Right, why was she able to sell, I think five million copies in one year, one year of this book? And I found a really cool pattern. So check this out. So what I found in each of her books is in the introduction, is she states that one core theory the entire book is based around. She's read the introduction, it's a couple pages long, but it comes down to this one thought right here. She says, ultimately you're responsible for who you will become and how happy you are. That's it. And then the rest of the book is all stories and things to back up and actually prove that one theory. Which is kind of cool. And I looked at Girl, stop apologizing. Her second book, I pulled it open, also signed to my wife, Kalei. And I went through here, I was reading it and sure enough, she says, here's the core of the book is that women are afraid of themselves. Boom. And so it all hinges on one core theory and that's what's so exciting. So in my book right now, I have a whole bunch of principles that I wanna share. And inside this principle, I've got stories, I've got tactics, I've got strategy stuff I wanna do. But I wanna feel like what is the one theory that the entire book hangs from, right? In sales we call this the big domino, right? What's the one thing if I can believe this and everything else falls down? And then we hit it from a thousand triangles. And as I'm looking at Rachel's books, I'm looking at Annie's books, I'm looking at Jordan Peterson's books, I'm looking at all these books sold to million copies. They're not trying to convince people two, three, five, 10, 15 things. It's all coming down to one core theory. What's the big domino I need them to believe? Like the goal of this book and all the rest, everything else is all there to support and to prove the theory true. So I'm excited. Again, I feel like I have the principle strategy and tactics that started in writing for the last two years, but they weren't all hanging on one core theory. And so my assignment for today is to figure out what is the core theory that my book is gonna hang on. All right, I'll let you know when I figure it out. Peace. Good morning, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome to day number three of writing a best-selling book and hopefully selling a million copies. I am talking to more people who have sold a million copies of the book. So I actually talked to Annie Grace, the author of The Stake in Mind. So I was like, how did you write this book to get people who want to pass it on and share it? And she sent me a voxer today. I kind of went through the entire structure of the book. And so I thought, you guys wanna hear it? Cause I listened to it probably seven or eight times. I'm taking notes on it. I'm like mapping, holding out. It's giving me so much cool structure on how to structure my book. All right, step one, the preface. So how I think about a nonfiction book is in basically rules of three. I think it's a really good, solid, it can be universal, things full to think about. It usually starts with like high drama. So it's your backstory, your origin story, at a moment of high drama. So the card crashed, I woke up at three in the morning with a piece of my stuff. Like I just got in this news, I just got in that news. So like really hooks them in. And then the introduction becomes really practical. Like what this book will do for you. So no two now is the introduction. In This Stake in Mind, the first two sentences of the first paragraph of the introduction make the big hairy promise. The promise to the point where it's almost unbelievable, but it also makes people hopeful. Then you might want to say, I know that's a big promise. I need the rest of the book to prove it to you. Just stick with me. Like what if I'm right? But I think that promise should be the first sentence of the book really. Now we break the book down to three core sections and each section should have three more points. And then I think about that big hairy objective. And I say, okay, what are the three key elements that are the three key points or arguments that support that? And then that could be really the three sections of the book. In each chapter, if you get the three main points, the three key arguments in the chapter should follow the same format as the whole book. What happens when you do that and you do it in sort of a repeating structure, the brain feels safe. So the more the brain can feel predictability in the structure, the more open it can be to the new concepts and the new ideas. And then you just start filling it in. So when you start with the big overall showy work, it's kind of like building the house and you're starting with the blueprints. So what are all the points I need to make to make this argument? The three key ones, how do those do still down? How do those break down? How do I support each of those arguments? Once you do that, you just outline it. And the outline, I think is best served if you outline with questions for yourself to fill in later. When your brain hears a question, it's like Google, I can't not answer it. So you write your outlining question format, that way you don't get right or spot. It's a flexible rule, but it's just a framework to kind of help kick things off and get the structure right. Because if the structure's right, the information can become palatable. You feel smart when you can predict what's gonna happen next, even on a subconscious level. All right, so after listening to that five or six times, I went back through Andy's book and I saw everything, I saw the preface work, saw the introduction work, saw how her book was broken into sections, and sex was broken into smaller steps of three. And inside there are the stories, the tanges, the backs, like all of the pieces. So it gives me a lot to think through as I'm planning out the structure of the book to make sure that I'm not wandering off in different directions like what's happened over the last two years. So that's the goal of the game plan for today. I'll let you know how it goes tomorrow. All right, I hope you are enjoying these videos. If you are, please like and subscribe to the channel. I'm gonna jump back in and keep showing you guys the next days in the series, but I wanna make sure you guys do not miss this. I'm gonna be showing you guys the next week here, coming up very, very soon. I wanna make sure you don't miss any of the videos. With that said, I'm gonna jump you guys into the next day. Hey, welcome to day number four of writing a bestselling book and trying to sell a million copies. Back to you in the way of the airport, I wanna show you guys a hack that I learned to write faster. A lot of times we get stuck when we're trying to write because we are a right brain and we are a left brain and we're going back and forth and the hack I'm gonna show you guys is huge. I'm gonna be using it on the fight today. I'll wait till last Vegas. Let me show you how I do this. Okay, so I'm in one of the rooms that go out of my writing in. I wanna explain that for all the humans, we have a right brain and a left brain. Right brain is very creative. Our left brain is very analytical, it's trying to edit all the time. So one of the problems when you write is that you are writing very creatively, but your left brain is trying to edit the whole time. And so a lot of times doing it in Google Docs, just like that, it gets hard because you keep switching back and forth and it's hard to get anything done. And so there's a new company came out called FreeWrite. Check this out. All right, so this is called FreeWrite. This is basically, it's like a typewriter. You can upload stuff to the internet but you cannot edit, you can't research, you can't do anything. All you can do is write, force you to stay in your right brain, creative brain. They do have a backspace, that's the only way you can edit. And so what happens is you down, you start typing and you're gonna make a ton of mistakes and that's okay because after you're done, you send it somewhere else. You can send it to Google Drive or you can send it to your email and then you can edit it from there. You try to write as fast as you can, many words you can, work out, work out, work out. Then you send it off and you edit it later when you want to go pure left brain. Okay, this is all about staying in your right brain so you can stay creative. Again, this one is called the Ernest Hemingway, which is so cool. This is the briefcase it comes with. But for my trip right now about to jump on a plane, I don't want to haul this whole thing and work on the plane with this. And so this is the Travel FreeWrite which came out recently. You open it up and boom, it's the exact same concept. Here's got the screen I can write in. Here's the back space so I can edit. When you're done, you click send, boom. And for me, it's still to my Google Drive at my email. So it sends an email the drop down wrote and it sends to my Google Drive and then later when I get home for my trip, I'll be able to edit it and make it amazing. So there you go, this freeWrite Travel Edition right here, which is amazing over the Hemingway right here. I get off the plane right now and I've got over 1800 words in 10,000 characters and now I'm white. So that is the power of freeWrite. It's nice because typically you get stuck and you're like, I want to find this quote so you go to the researcher to find it. Here it's like, go find quote in the key type and type in it and there it is. We'll put it on so it's happening on the plane last hour. All right, welcome to day number five of writing a best-selling book and hopefully selling a million copies. Yes, there's been a flight and it wrote two thirds of a chapter on the freeWrite. That was all focusing on right brain creativity so I could focus and not get distracted editing and today that was an editing day. So I'm gonna do some basically, I'm gonna open this up to see, I was able to write 1800 words, that 10,000 characters and now I want to send it to my computer so I come down here and I click the button says send, boom. And then your document has been sent. All right, so check it out. It came in my inbox and there is everything that I wrote. I can now grab it. Actually two versions of this. I'm gonna grab right here, copy that over and come down versus four. Chapter number one that I'm working on, boom. It's all in here. And then you can see how bad the editing is because I'm not able to edit. Like I got basically every other word, the thing correct, but it's all in there. So now left brain's editing. I'm just focusing editing, cleaning up, getting formatting, getting punctuation, getting the words right. And then the rest of today, I'll have a chance to go through and just kind of try to like weave a lot of my notes, a lot of my ideas into a chapter and hopefully making it a cohesive chapter and then we'll have a chapter done. So far I haven't even gotten to the whole outline of the book or anything. I just wanted to start. I wanted to get something written. I wanted to get these dots out of my head and just into a spot right because I'm working on it. So that's where I am now. First writing session is done. Now the editing session is starting. And we'll see what happens. That's kind of it for today. Tomorrow I'm going to spend more time outlining and researching now that it's officially done. So there you go. Comment down below if you want to see what I wrote in this first day. All right, make some good. What's up everybody? Welcome to day number six, Writing a Best Selling Book and hopefully selling million copies. Today I'm going to be into outlining. This is something that I do with every book so let's try to create the outline. But my head I think about it is the table contents. It's an ever changing document that's always changing and morphing and tweaking. People always ask me, do you know the end of the book when you start? The answer for me is no. I know kind of the direction I'm going. But if you look at any of my books, like my first outline, I have created an entire line where it's starting, where I'm ending. And I start writing as I go through. It's like, oh, that's the wrong. Cause I change it. I'm changing and changing it. And by the time the book is done, if you go back and look at the original outline and the last one, they're not even close to anything but like similar at all, it still gives me like a direction to go. So the tool I use to do outlining is called Workflow. I think it's free app. Maybe you pay on it even though, but it's really simple. It's like a never ending bullet list, secrets of success. And then from there it starts the bullet list. And so here's where I start creating my table contents. And so for me, usually it's going to be something like preface, then I start titling my chapters. I call mine secrets. And I'll also start giving them titles. Like I know the direction I want to go from secrets to driven. I can go through all the different secrets. So I'll click on secret number one and that becomes new bullet. Okay. What are all the things I'll cover in secret number one? From there I can go and I can create a simple point. Just thinking about each of the core beats, the core secrets, the core chapters on a hit. Secret number two I'll go through. And then one of the things I'll talk about here. And then I'll go through it. I'll add those things and I'll think about one of the quotes for the stories and ideas. I'm gonna try to get a final outline of the entire book as I see it today. Again, it's gonna change with a million times between now and then. That's gonna go for today. Filling out the different stories, the principles, the ideas. So that's happening day number six. Focusing 100% and getting the table contents and the outline built inside of workflowing. Welcome to day number seven of writing a best selling book and hopefully selling a million copies. This morning I got up and I've started working and one of my friends, Connor Boyack, who by the way has written probably 100 books, 200 books. And he saw day number five where I showed him the editing in Google Docs. And this is the text I just got from him. He said, seeing you write in Google Docs and shivers down my spine. I use that for writing all my books. Passing along in case it's helpful. And he sent me a link to an email. And I said, I'm gonna go and get it. This is helpful. And he sent me a link to an app called Scrivener. So I played with that setup today and so far it is amazing. So I'm gonna show you guys what this looks like. So you can see over here, this is the manuscript inside of Google Docs I've been working on. Prom is like right now as I'm editing, going back and forth, I wanna find something like I scroll back up through 20 pages, find this thing, copy and paste it down. And I'm like, oh, what are the table contents? Which direction am I going? I have to go back up and down and it is chaos. He told me to try this new process. I wanna show you what happened and why I'm actually loving this. Number one has this really cool side meaning they call the binder. I have my draft and they make basically folder for each chapter. So I have title page, table contents, introduction. There's a research tab. So I have all my research. I can go in one spot here, put all my transcripts in here. All the things for my free writing I can post in here and all my outlines from different versions of this. So everything is here in this amazing little side menu. And the other cool thing is that when you start writing, you can have up to two different things. You can have the table contents on one side and the chapter over here or two versions of the page. You can scroll around and it makes it so much easier to write and edit and find things to cut and to paste. I've had this on my computer now for like six or seven hours and it is the same. All of my research, all my everything is in one spot and I feel like I can finally get to work. Now I feel like I'm in a real rider. So anyway, I'm pumped. Thank you Connor for the suggestion. Again, this is two years of me writing this book. So I have so much stuff and it's chaos. Those who know me, I'm not a super clean person. Like look at my office, it is always a nightmare. I've got, here's the mail that came in this week and all the books. Like my whole world is chaos and writing can't be chaos because it's too hard to find everything it takes too long. So now it's all in one spot, organized and I'm pumped. So there you go. Now I can finally get to writing, speed my process and hopefully we can get this book done sooner or later. Thanks everybody. All right, I hope you guys enjoyed the very first seven days of how I'm writing a best selling book and hopefully selling a million copies. If you enjoyed this series, please let me know in the comments down below. I want to keep posting these things in first off, getting you guys feedback, which is a lot of fun and hopefully inspiring some of you guys to start writing your very first book as well. With that said, one of the number one questions like you getting from people over and over and over again is also can I reach after number one? I want to see what you're writing, like let us know and I'm not ready to share with anybody yet but one cool thing did happen. Recently I did an event for young entrepreneurs. They call unlock the secrets. And for my keynote presentation, I decided to share what I taught in chapter number one of the book which is really helping to understand how your brain works. And I did it in a way that was really fun for little kids and so I had a bunch of stuffed animals, I had an elephant, a lizard and some monkeys and I explained how your brain actually works. I took that presentation actually through on YouTube recently. So if you want to see a presentation that says close to chapter number one of the book as I actually have right now, you can watch that right now. There's a link right here to the video somewhere. Click on the link on the video. It'll take you to the other video on my YouTube channel where you're gonna see similar stuff I'm teaching in chapter number one of the brand new book and I hope you enjoy it. So links right here, check it out and let me know what you think about the content.
