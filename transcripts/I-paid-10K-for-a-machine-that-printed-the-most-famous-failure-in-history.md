Think about books back in the day, how cool they were. Because it wasn't like nowadays we have a printer, you print out pages, they fold them and cut them and stuff. This they'd have to have a printing plate. And you put every single letter in like T, H, E, and you print them all in there. You stamp them with A, put them in here, pressure down, presses on the page, comes back up, and you go print it again and print it again. And imagine how much work went into printing books back there. I think we take it so much for granted. It's the reason why I love old books, because someone didn't just write a book and post it, you know, had AI write a book and posted it on Amazon two days later and start shipping copies, right? Like they had to think about it, they had to write it, and then literally pay for somebody to go letter by letter to put it all together, put it on a press like this section. They'd press it into the page, and the work that went into printing books back in the day, it was amazing. I want to show you guys this old printing press I bought. I spent $10,600 in this printing press, plus a whole bunch of money to ship it here. It was really heavy. But this is not just a printing press, but it's a really special one. As you guys probably know, I'm building an event center in a museum right now. In the museum there's a whole bunch of different authors that we're showcasing. One of my favorite authors is the guy named Elbert Hubbard. Any of you guys who saw the video I did on the message of Garcia, Elbert Hubbard was one who wrote that book. But he, and this is a picture of him right here, Elbert actually ran a community called The Roycrofters, and they're kind of like an Amish community where they did a whole bunch of really cool things, but they did a lot of printing. They were like the printing press of the New Thotmulah back in the day, and they printed all sorts of books. And so this right here, the book of The Roycrofters, and this book is really cool, because this is just a catalog of different books that they were printing. So you can look in here and you see like, oh, here's the free book you can buy from them. The reason why I share with you this is because this printing press is from The Roycrofters. It was in the location. It was printing a whole bunch of books way back in the day, but not only that, it printed one of America's most important books. You may have heard of it. It printed the first edition, Wizard of Oz. And that's why this printing press is so special for me, because number one, it was in The Roycrofters. It was an Elbert Hubbard's actually printing press, and number two, it actually printed the first edition of Wizard of Oz. Which is kind of cool. I haven't tried to lift the printing press up yet, but it's pretty heavy. I mean, it's solid. We could definitely use this for deadlifts. We could use it for pressing curls. Not right now, till my arm's sealed. But in the future, I'll be able to definitely, you know, do a lot more exercises with this in the future. That's the plan. Most of the books I collect have been personal development books or religion books. Things like that that I'm really passionate about. But last summer, I went on a cruise with my kids. And I remember that night, they had a Wizard of Oz show. And so I took Nora and my wife and went to this show. We were watching the whole thing. And I was just like mesmerized by the story of Wizard of Oz. Like, I love it. And then later we went to saw a wicked. But I remember that night, after watching the Wizard of Oz on the cruise ship, thinking like, who wrote Wizard of Oz? What's the story about this person? I don't know nothing about this author. And I was fascinated. So I started first Google search, like who wrote Wizard of Oz? It comes back. It was L. Frank Bong, right? He wrote this in 1900. So it was the very first edition came out. It was first like, then over the time almost one year for the rest of his life, you wrote a new book. So if you look back here, I've got editions of every single one of them. So one's like, again, Wizard of Oz. This one's like Grandpa's Oz, The Lost King of Oz, Dorothy's Oz, there's Scarecrow and Oz. Like almost every single character in the Oz world he created, each of them had their own book, telling their backstory and their life and everything. I was able to find someone who's selling the entire collection plus all the original dust jackets. And so I bought it in me. I mean, this is so cool. I wanted to have a collection of Wizard of Oz stuff. Later I started reading the story about L. Frank Bomb and in the author. This is the reason why I want to make this video. It's for all of us. So if you look at his life, he wrote this book. And he creates whole universe, this whole world he was sharing with everybody. And then he went out there. First thing he's like, he's like, I want to turn this into a movie or a play. So when he got a play written for it and they launched it and it failed. Later he raised money and tried to launch as a film. He tried three different times to launch the Oz series as a film. And every single was failed and it failed and it failed. When he ended up dying, he passed away, broke in debt, bankruptcy, all sorts of stuff. Basically thinking that his vision and his art that he created was a failure. And then 20 years later, somebody found the book, read it, and he created the movie, The Wizard of Oz. Which now is one of the most beloved films in the history of American film, right? Everyone's seen the Wizard of Oz. My kids have seen it. They've played, you know, now they're adaptions with wickets. How is the different versions of the story? Like all that came from one guy who was so passionate about his dreams, his creativity, his stories, his art, and his world he created. But if you think about it, he never actually had a chance to see the fulfillment of a Dragon Slythe. I want to shut up with you guys because a lot of us who are experts, we're out there every single day doing our stuff, right? We're creating YouTube videos, we're posting podcasts, we're creating products, we're speaking, we're traveling, we're doing all this stuff. And the reality is most of the time you don't know the impact of the things you're creating in Slythe. Sometimes you get the blessing to find out, right? There's times when I'm at Funnel Hacking Live, people call me like, I'm gonna have to be like, I'm gonna change my life, or I'll see some of the airport. And those times are so fulfilling, but for every one of those, there's people you're touching and you're fed to you and never here for. Like I remember a year and a half ago, my wife and I were in Vegas for something and we were literally just walking through the casino and this guy runs up to me. And he's like, hey, he's like, dude, you changed my life, my life. I was like, no, let me tell you the story. He's always talking about how he had no money, bumped into my book, read the book, and then started using ClickFunnels. I used to call him a cook, see, he's like, but I've never actually submitted for any of them. And quite not. He's like, I just didn't feel like I wanted to brag about it. He's like, dude, I've, and I was just like, it's just crazy. Like I know we have documented like 3000 people that have wanted to call him a cook, or like we have 4,500 of them want to call a cook. Like we have all documentation yet. There's this guy who's hit all the awards and more that I'd never even heard it before. He's never like submitted for paperwork. And I think about people's lives that have changed me, right? Like I read some of this book or I saw a video or heard some speech somewhere and they radically transformed my life. I never told them before. Like if I saw them, I would tell them, but I never had access to actually tell that person the experience and how they affected me, right? I think about that for all of us as creators. One of the reasons why I tell people, like you should be publishing every day, you actually put your message out there because you have no idea who you're affecting. And a lot of the times you are never going to hear about it. L. Frank mom died, beginning his book and his, his legacy was a failure. And 20 years later became one of the most famous stories in the world. He never had a chance to see that legacy. And so I wanted to share that just because I was the number one, this is the cool piece I decided to have the library, but number two, the story of this author and the books here is the key role. She just inspires me like, Hey, I may not ever know in this lifetime what the ripple effect is of my work. That's the things I'm putting out there. Knowing that someone like him never got to see an event. Now it's become what it has. It gives me more faith in my life. I'm going to keep putting things out there. I'm going to keep publishing, I'm going to keep promoting, I'm going to keep trying to put like plant as many seeds as I can out there into the world. Cause you never know what soil is going to hit and the blossom is going to change that person's life. Hopefully it gives you motivation. I remember at the second funnel hacking live ever, Sean Stevenson is one of my close friends, passed away a couple of years later, but good. I remember he shared this powerful metaphor about the lifeboat premise of his story was when somebody is a helicopter coming to save something from lifeboat, right? Like you see all these people in the water. It's like, who do you say you get closer and there's people swimming all sorts of ways. And he's like, only people you can save for the ones who are swimming towards you. And he started talking about it. While you guys have a YouTube video got 200 views. We posted a TikTok and 30 people saw it. A lot of time, like, oh, only 300 people saw it. Only 10,000 people saw it. Only whatever it's like, you know, 10,000 people saw 20,000. Like that fills the stadium. And the people are coming and liking it. Those are the people they're swimming towards. Those are the people we have a chance to save. Our job is to put the message out there. Try to make as much ripple effect as you can. And some percent of people are going to start swimming towards you. Those are the ones who need your help. Those are the ones who your message could change their life forever. And I remember writing the expert secrets book at the very beginning, writing the introduction there. I was like, you understand, like your message matters. Like you might have the advice to save somebody's marriage. You might have the advice, help somebody lose weight, find like, feel confidence in life. It might be the one that gives them what they need to get freedom from whatever, right? And it's like, if you're willing to put those things out there, that's why I do what I do. Cause I love seeing those messages. I love seeing the positive influence that you have put out there. Now it can change people's lives. It's interesting when you look at his work, like this is the book to be known for, but he was so passionate. He was always thinking about so much that he built like a whole universe of cast and characters and stories and backstories and everything that gave like more color to him for this. It's interesting because like you never know what things you'll be famous for. You know, which things are going to stick with people, right? You can choose what you want to put out there in the universe, but the market chooses what it values. It actually wants to. So our job is not to know, it's just to put as many things in top of the funnel as possible. From that, different things will get deeper and deeper where your best work will appear. You know, what I'll say, Doug, this first book, the very first, the beginning one was the one that was lost and it turned to such a big thing. You know, I think for us, it's like coming out there and just knowing like, I don't know where I'm going. I don't know exactly the gay planning so that my job is to publish and put myself out there and try to share any of the insights that I've got for my life with other people and the right people are going to find it. They're going to hear your voice, you know, chance to change their lives. So put a lot of stuff out there consistently. Even if it makes no sense, right? Well, Oz doesn't make any sense. There's a walking scarecrow who cried out, no, this makes no sense. The moral of the story is you're one book of Oz away. All right, if you want to dive a little bit deeper with Albert Hubbard and the Roy Crofters, again, I did a video a little while ago about his number one best-selling book, which is called The Message of Garcia. We'll leave that video in the description down below. You can also get the actual attire PDF of the book notes page. So again, all that stuff's down in the description below and I hope you enjoy the story and hopefully this inspires you to get your message out to more people because people's lives, you're going to change or just waiting for it. So thank you so much. Appreciate you guys. We'll see you on the next video.
