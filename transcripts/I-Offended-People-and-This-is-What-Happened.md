People start liking me, was like excited. The other side came. They make fun of my hair, my face, my, how fast I talk, how I slow it, it just shut me down. I was just like, ah. The man, Russell. Hey, just sell your product. I love this guy. Love this guy. I honestly believe the entrepreneurs are the only people that can actually change this planet. Hey, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the channel. So excited to have you here. Now, on today's video, I'm gonna be talking about why you may actually want to offend people as a digital marketer. But before we get into that, make sure you click on the subscribe button down below. Make sure you're subscribed to the channel and turn on your notifications. That way, when the new videos come out, you will be the first in your market to get them. With that said, let's jump into this video. All right, now this is gonna seem super counterintuitive. Our entire lives, we've all been raised to be nice to people, to be friendly, to not cause arguments or fights or frustrations, right? Our whole entire life, we've done that. I think a lot of times people, when they start their online businesses, they're so afraid of offending anybody. Because that, you start tiptoeing around this topic and this topic and they're very, very careful. And the problem with that is when you're neutral, you're boring and nobody cares. Boring. Getting your voice out there, getting your message is all about being prolific, being someone who's willing to kind of push the boundaries and push the edges. Look at the people who have had the most success. They're people who aren't afraid to share their opinions and offend people. To have success, you gotta have polarity. So polarity, when you do that by default, when you start becoming polar, what'll happen is that on one side, you're gonna have people who become raving fans. But the opposite of that is when you get raving fans, you always get the other side of polarity, which is people who will not like you, okay? And at first it's frustrating. I promise you, when I first started publishing things online, people started liking me, I was excited. And then the other side came, people who were upset and were offended. And remember at first it shut me down. I was just like, ah, I don't wanna do this. This is painful. I don't like you saying bad things about me. They make fun of my hair. How fast I talk, how I slur, like all the things, okay? And they'll start coming out at you and you'll see them. And it's hard. At one point where I was depressed for two or three days, I didn't wanna create a video. I didn't wanna talk and I didn't wanna do anything. And then one of my very first mentors, posted something online, his name's Dan Kennedy. And he said, if you haven't offended someone by noon each day, then you're not marketing hard enough. And I remember hearing that and thinking, oh my gosh, like that's freeing to me to understand. Like I can't let the voice and the noise of the people on the other side to stress me out. I have to be polar. I have to be pushing the edges. I have to be pushing the boundary. I have to be loud. I have to be talking, to be publishing. That this other group is not gonna like. Some of the things I do to help me is number one is, I'm not the first person to read my comments. I have someone go through and delete the horrible negative comments. If you try to distance yourself because as a creator, as you're creating things and putting out there, a lot of times that'll stop your momentum. You hear someone talk bad and it's gonna be like, oh, why am I doing this? Why am I creating it? So you need to try to block yourself as good as possible. That's number one. Number two, there's always gonna be stuff that slips through. So when it slips through, you've gotta read it. Instead of looking at me like, oh, instead you gotta look at that and say, yes. Okay, I had another mentor, Matt Furrier. He said, every time you got a hater message of something or read a bad comment, he'd stand up and his chair yell at top of his lungs, hurrah, because he said that because that person's offended, it means that someone over here's becoming more of a true fan. So you've gotta be able to shift your mindset to be okay with that. Do not be afraid of being loud, of sharing your message. No matter how clean cut, how perfect, how nice you try to be, or on the other side, how aggressive and how bad you wanna be, you're always gonna offend people, but it's the only way to really get your true fans on the opposite side to love you. And that's how you get them to buy your products, buy your services, and that way you can actually change their life. And in digital marketing, in fact, not only is it okay, if you don't do it, I promise you, nobody's hearing your message at all. So with that said, I hope that gives you guys some permission to go out there and be yourself. Enjoy it, don't be embarrassed, don't be afraid. And when the haters come, shout top of your lungs, hurrah, that means you changed somebody else's life on the other side of it. All right, I hope that video helped you. I hope that if you've had a hater and you've been struggling with it, you kinda released it for you.
