## Transcript
Alright, today I want to talk about the difference between branding and direct response marketing and then after that I'm going to talk to you guys about a fight that Gary Vee and I had on stage about this exact same topic. The world I now live in, these big agencies, they're 100% art. They have no respect to sales. These are the pieces that we have used to turn ClickFronts what is today. I literally feel like leaving. Thank you. So, what is branding? Most people know what branding is. Branding is you create a brand and an image and you put it out there and hopefully your company grows because you got a really cool brand. The opposite side is direct response marketing. That sounds kind of nerdy and weird. What is direct response marketing? Well, direct response is I'm going to put something out into the marketplace and try to get somebody to immediately respond back. Now, Gary Vee and it's probably the king of branding online and I believe I am the king of direct response marketing online as we have kind of two different directions. And so a little while ago we were running an event for ClickFronts. And ClickFronts was about to pass 50,000 active members. We just hired the Harman Brothers to build this viral video. I like to paint nudes. Squirtles that is. Fancy folk buy them right up. Don't ask me why. I just paint them. If you're only the Harman Brothers are, they're ones who did Squatty Potty, Poop-A-Rain, all the viral videos you kind of know online. We hired them, paid them a fortune to build this video. We're going to launch and hopefully get brandy and direct response. I thought if we're doing this big event, we should talk about these two different principles and so we hired Gary Vaynerchik to come and be one of our keynotes. With that said, everybody to stand up and put our hands together for Gary Vaynerchik. Thank you so much. You know what's interesting? I was sitting there and listening. During the event, I spoke about how we built ClickFronts from zero to over 100 million dollars in sales using direct response marketing. And then Gary got up and talked about how he had built his companies using branding. The way that Gary kind of positioned online said that Russell's doing is all about science and what he was doing is all about art. And so I'm spending an ungodly amount of time on everything that isn't the math. It's incredible that we now live in a world where the people that are building great companies in this and they do great and they make a lot of money, they deserve it because they take things that we don't have to worry about out of the equation. And the fact of the matter is math will always be that one. The things that aren't are the art, the creativity, and most importantly, the intuition and then the audacity to leave money on the table every single day of your life. To invest in the world that you think is going to be there in 24 months. And then you have to be right. Otherwise you lose. And you could tell by the way that he kind of presented it that what he thought what I was doing was kind of lesser class and he thought that the branding was more important. And you can tell from what I thought, I thought the branding was way less important and the direct response is more important. So the question is who won? Well, I'm not going to lie. It caused kind of a fight between me and Gary. I don't think I'd talk to him for a couple years since then. And so there's little animosity. He's built his brands. I built my brands through different means. Both have definitely worked. But I'm not going to lie. Was not a huge Gary V fan after this presentation. But I saw him again about a week and a half ago at the live event. We saw backstage with Kiss and Made Up and I'm a Gary V fan once again. So Gary, welcome back. We're going to get you into direct response marketing soon enough. But until I convince you, I'm going to try to convince everybody out. So branding is great. We know we love it. The problem with branding is a couple of things. Number one is that when you're trying to create a brand, you're using social media. You are literally left to the whims of the algorithm, which as you know, changes. It comes and goes. For years when I was building my business, I was focusing on doing SEO and building things through Google Organic. And guess what happened overnight? Everything shifted. The algorithm changed and I lost all my traffic, all my rankings and they weren't gone. And you may be thinking, well, Russell, that's SEO. This is different. That's this branding. But the exact same thing happens every single day in social media. Right. When I first got into Facebook, I think Facebook's the greatest thing in the world. I'm going to build a big brand there. I built the following almost a million people on Facebook. And guess what? Last week I went live on Facebook. When Facebook live to my million fans and only 50 people showed up. Is that crazy? Because the algorithm shifted and all the work I did disappeared overnight. I see it on Instagram where people get millions of followers and they say something, they get canceled. The algorithm shifts them out and that fast their business is gone. All the branding, all the equity, everything you put in is at the whims of the algorithms of other companies, which is kind of scary. With direct response marketing, you can control your own destiny. This was the power of it. I can literally go and I can turn on an ad. I get somebody to come to me, whether they like me or they not, whether the algorithm thinks I'm cool or not. I can pay for that person and get them to come to me and come into my world. And so that's between branding and direct response marketing. Now I'm a big direct response guy because my first mentor was a guy named Dan Kennedy. And Dan Kennedy has written a ton of books. One of my favorite books is a book right here called the No BS Direct Response. The No BS Direct Marketing Ultimate No Hold Bar. It's a really long title, way too long. I just call it the No BS Direct Marketing book because it's really good. And in here, he's got 10 commandments of direct response marketing. And they're all really, really good, but there's one that's the most important I want to share with you. It's rule number five. And rule number five is this. He says, whatever brand building occurs will be a happy byproduct. It will not be bought. It means you do not spend money to build your brand. But if you build your brand as a byproduct of direct response marketing, that's great. Now a good example of this is ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels is my business. It's my brand. I've been running it for the last decade. Okay, but we do not buy ads, driving people just to go to ClickFunnels. Instead, what we do is we create really good offers. We buy ads to the dry people to those offers. They buy our product or service. And then after that, they learn about ClickFunnels and the brand. This will help you to get your first business off the ground and having success as quickly as humanly possible. What I found doing this now for almost two decades is that the very first thing I put out there, the brand doesn't actually help you at all. In fact, initially the brand hurts when we have a landing page we're buying ads to. And there's a logo and a picture and a story about you and your company. It actually hurts conversion rates. So most of our landing pages are kind of blind. There's that offer. There's a headline. There's a reason that somebody would respond. We send someone there, they give us their email address, so they buy a product or something. Then they come into our world and at that point we introduce them to us and to our brand. Okay, because the very first interaction is not about you. Okay, the first question is from his mind is what's in it for me? W-I-I-F-M. And so what's in it for them is not you or your brand. The first thing that's in it for them is the offer you're making. So most of our landing pages that are going to cold traffic are all about what's in it for them. A hook and a headline that's about them that's going to get them excited and give them a result. Then they come into our world and at that point we introduce them to me, into our brand, into our story, and then they build the connection. So we use direct response marking to make the first sell and we use branding to make the second sell. Does that make sense? And so even though I make fun of brand, I do believe in brand. Brand is important but not on the front end. Brand is the second thing you do. Direct response marking brings somebody into your world based on a benefit for them and then branding is what builds the connection with you to get them to buy from you over and over and over again. Now the first time you get somebody into your world is the most expensive. It's the hardest thing to do but the second time they buy from you is the cheapest. It's the best because that I am a believer in brand even only when used in conjunction with direct response marketing. So we use direct response to get people into our world and we use branding to keep them in our world. So a few things now. The first thing I want you to understand is that as you are trying to create your brand and your company, the first question you should be asking yourself is what's in it for them? What's the hook or the message or the offer you can put out that'll get somebody to come to you? It's very focused on them not on you. And the second step is now they're in your world how you build that connection and build that brand relationship with them. Now I understand that by watching this video some of you guys are going to completely disagree with me. You're going to side with Gary. I think that Gary's right and I totally understand that but some of you guys understand the truth. And so I'm curious which side you lean on. Are you more of like leading with branding or leading with direct response? Where do you fit? Let me know in the comments down below. I want to engage in this battle together down in the comments because I know that it's controversial. In fact, I've had debates on stage with multiple people about branding versus direct response and what's better and what's more important. And again, the reality, my belief is you need both but you lead with direct response and then you build long term with the brand. So what is your opinion? I want to know. I want to debate this down in the comments down below. Maybe one of you guys have changed my mind. Maybe I'll turn off all my ads and just start buying ads to my logo. But until then I need you guys to tell me your beliefs and your reasons down below. On top of that, if you haven't read about direct response or you know about it, this is one of the best books to begin with. Again, from Dan Kenney, it's called the Novia Sky the direct marketing. In here it gives you the 10 commandments to direct response. All of them are amazing. They'll teach you exactly how to put a message in the marketplace to get your dream customers to come to you and you can build the brand them long term and strengthen that relationship over time. So that's it. Make sure you copy this book. Read it because readers are leaders. I appreciate you listening to this video. And if you're enjoying this, please come back at some really cool videos coming out in the near future. Every week we're dropping new videos to help you to grow your business, grow your brand and change the lives of the customers that you've been called to serve.
