Their answer is usually, “Y es, ” to which I reply, 
“The only businesses that need ClickFunnels are 
businesses that either need leads or customers. 
So if your business needs leads or customers, 
then yes, you need ClickFunnels. ”
Though few in number, there are some businesses 
that don’t need ClickFunnels because they don’t 
need leads or customers. In the case of these 
businesses, they have too many leads and 
too many customers. In fact, they’re probably 
freaking out because their business is exploding 
and all they want to do is slow it down. In their 
case, they probably shouldn’t use ClickFunnels 
because it would give them more leads and more 
customers. 
For everyone else, though, you’re probably 
wishing you had that problem. Y ou want more 
leads and more customers. After all, leads are 
the backbone of your business. The more leads 
you can get, the more products and services you 
can sell. At ClickFunnels, we help you generate 
leads through what we call lead funnels.
While this book is titled, “114 Unique Lead Funnels 
That Y ou Can Model to Build a List, Generate 
Leads, and Create Prospects Who Are Ready and 
Willing to Buy from Y ou, ” it’s about so much more 
than just that. This book is broken into two main 
sections: strategy and examples.
In section one, we’ll discuss history, strategy, 
and implementation. We’ll be reviewing the 
history behind lead funnels, and how pop-up ads 
paved the way for online marketing. We’ll also be 
understanding the strategy and implementation 
behind the five parts of a lead funnel: lead 
magnet, landing page, thank you page, sales 
page, and follow-up funnel. Y ou’ll learn what 
each one is, why they’re crucial to your business’ 
success, and how to create your lead funnel in 
five easy steps. 
In the second section, we’ll show you 114 
examples of unique lead funnels so you can 
see how it can work in your business. I found 
114 different examples for you because I want 
to prove to you that lead funnels work in any 
One of the questions I get asked most often is, “Do I need ClickFunnels?  
I don’t understand how it will work with my business. ” 
Knowing that ClickFunnels has the power to transform any business, it’s  
hard not to softly laugh as I respond, “Do you need leads or customers?”

industry from authors to local businesses to franchises and more! Obviously, there’s more than just 
114 lead funnels out there, but I think these examples will give you a really clear understanding of how 
you could use a lead funnel in your business. 
After understanding the history, strategy, and implementation in the first section, you’ll be able to pick 
any one of the 114 examples and bust it out in less than an hour. By the end of this book, you’ll know 
how to attract leads, build trust, grow a list of leads and customers, build relationships with your list, 
convert leads into customers, recoup your ad costs, offer your customers additional opportunities to 
work with you, and ascend customers up your value ladder. On top of that, you’ll have clear instructions 
on how to quickly and easily implement these strategies and methods into your own business to make 
it work for you. 
Now that you understand the scope of everything you’ll learn in this book, let’s dive right in and talk 
about the history of online lead generation. Y ou’ll see how generating leads has evolved from pop-up 
ads in the late 1990s to squeeze pages a few years later. T oday, squeeze pages have transformed into 
lead funnels. As you review the history of lead funnels, I hope you gain a deeper understanding of 
where online lead generation began and why it’s so effective and powerful today.
POP-UP ADS
Do you remember using computers about 20 years ago? At the time, I was graduating from high school 
and just starting college. Y ou’d go to a website, super excited that you found the information you were 
looking for, and then all of a sudden, the most annoying thing on the earth would happen. Boom! A big 
ad would pop up! 
The pop ups usually asked for your email address, then promised to do or give you something, “Give 
me your email address and you’ll get this free report, ” or “Give me your email address and you’ll get 
entered into a contest to win a million dollars, ” or any number of other offers. 
By getting your email address, the marketers were building an email list. While they did spend money 
to acquire your email address, they could then market to you forever without it costing them a penny. 
Pretty soon, their email lists started growing, first with tens of people, then thousands, then tens of 
thousands, then hundreds of thousands, and finally, millions of people they could market to from that 
point on for free. As you can imagine, that email list would be pretty valuable to the marketer, and as 
you learn to grow your own email list through this book, it will become very valuable to you as well.
Pop-up ads were huge back then, and many advertising agencies sold packages such as, “Have your 
pop up show up 18 million times for $50!” Okay, so maybe that’s an exaggeration, but I should know… 
I was one of those marketers that would buy those packages and have my ads show up on your 
computer. I joined this game right when pop ups were getting huge and I started building a huge email 
list. For me, pop ups were the lifeblood of my business. 
Pretty soon, though, the pop-up world went out of control. It wasn’t just one ad that would pop up; you’d 
usually get 14 ads that would pop up all at once, and of course that was super annoying for consumers. 
Sometimes you’d go to a site and your computer would just crash because it couldn’t handle all the pop 
ups. That’s when pop-up blockers were invented. All of a sudden, my business (and a bunch of other 
marketers’ businesses) pretty much disappeared overnight because my pop-up ads weren’t being seen 
anymore. Everyone in the pop-up world thought that the days of list building were gone.

SQUEEZE PAGES
Thankfully, with some brilliant minds, a new idea was born: the squeeze page! These marketers 
suggested, “What if instead of having someone come to a website where an ad would pop up, what 
if we made the pop up the actual page? It would act as a gateway, and it would force people to put in 
their email address to actually see what they wanted to see. It would literally ‘squeeze’ the email right 
out of them!”
And while this will probably age me, I still remember those early marketing debates. Other marketers 
responded to the idea by saying, “Why would you do that? Y ou’re blocking people from seeing your 
website. That’s the dumbest thing in the world!” 
Thankfully, a bunch of marketers started testing it. Amazingly, the squeeze page concept worked, and 
it shifted business as we know it. Instead of spending money on pop-up ads, we spent money to drive 
traffic to our squeeze pages. In essence, we were still paying to obtain email addresses through the 
squeeze pages, but we were able to continue growing our email lists so we could market to those lists 
for free forever. 
As the cost to drive traffic grew, though, we started creating additional steps after the squeeze page to 
recoup our ad costs. These additional steps are now called a lead funnel, and the term “squeeze page” 
evolved to “landing page. ” 
LEAD FUNNELS
At its foundation, a lead funnel is a funnel 
that generates leads, but it does so much 
more than that. It not only attracts leads, but 
it also builds trust, grows a list of leads and 
customers, builds relationships with your list, 
converts leads into customers, recoups your 
ad costs, offers your customers additional 
opportunities to work with you, and ascends 
customers up your value ladder. But before 
you can do any of that, you have to have a 
lead first, and that’s what lead funnels do: 
they help you get leads.
A lead funnel has five simple parts: lead 
magnet, landing page, thank you page, sales 
page, and follow-up funnel. T o illustrate 
these parts, I’d love to share with you a story 
about the very first lead funnel I ever saw: 
DoubleY ourDating.com from marketer Eben 
Pagan. He’s a big business development 
trainer and sales trainer right now, but 
back then, Eben used the pen name David 
DeAngelo to teach men how to pick up 
women. For simplicity, I’ll refer to him as Eben 
below because I’m discussing his site.  
FIRST LEAD FUNNEL I EVER SAW:
DOUBLE YOUR DATING

LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   5
At the time, I had heard about lead funnels, but they didn’t really make sense to me. They especially 
didn’t make sense when I saw this website and heard it made $20 million a year! 
“How in the world does this make $20 million a year?” I thought. “It doesn’t make logical sense… it’s 
just a landing page! I don’t get it. ” 
It wasn’t until I went through Eben’s entire lead funnel, though, that I truly understood what was 
happening. Y ou see, I could only see the tip of the iceberg when I saw his webpage. It looked like it was 
just a landing page, but beyond his landing page was the mass of his business.
T o truly understand lead funnels, I knew I had to “funnel hack” Eben’s site. In other words, I had to 
go through the landing page as if I was a customer, but I had to pay attention to every step after that 
because I was a marketer to see how I could model it for my business. In this way, I could see the rest of 
the iceberg below the ocean and finally understand how Eben was making $20 million with this website.
In order to move forward from his landing page, I had to put in my email address. I can’t tell you how 
scared I was to put in my email address. We see these types of forms all the time now, but it was brand 
new back then. After all, if I gave Eben my email address, I was going to get emails with his top dating 
tips. And as I had recently got married to my beautiful wife, I didn’t want my wife to think I was looking 
for ways to pick up women! 
So I called my wife and explained, “I have to put in my email into this website about dating. Obviously, I 
don’t want to learn about dating, but if I don’t put in my email I can’t figure out how this guy makes $20 
million. Is it okay if I give him my email address just for market research?” 
She laughed and quickly gave her permission, so I set off to funnel hack the Double Y our Dating website. 
I’ll list below the five parts to his lead funnel. Pay attention, because these are the five parts of the lead 
funnels you’ll be creating soon, too!   
 
5 Parts Of “Double Your Dating” Lead Funnel
 
1. Lead Magnet: Attract Leads to Build Value
Put simply, a lead magnet is something 
you give away for free when someone gives 
you his/her email address. In theory, you’d 
create a lead magnet that would attract your 
ideal customer and provide value. 
On the Double Y our Dating website, Eben did this with his lead magnet called “The Secrets Most Men 
Will Never Know About Women. ” Inside, you could learn the “Kiss T est: How to tell if she’s ready to be 
kissed” and other secrets. What Eben did was create a problem and a curiosity hook at the same time. 
If you were a single man trying to increase your dates, you probably would want to know those secrets. 
After all, if you didn’t get the secrets, you might worry that you could have had better dating success 
if you did know the secrets. Eben created a problem by suggesting there were secrets that you would 
never know about women unless you learned them from him.

Ready For Your Kiss –  And  
How To Avoid Rejection...

I was married, so I didn’t need dating advice, but I could imagine that if I was single and walking a girl to 
the door, I’d be super nervous, not knowing if I should kiss her or not. But with Eben’s kiss test, I could find 
out if she wanted to be kissed! If I was single, I would want to know more… I’d be so curious I’d be hooked!
2. Landing Page: Exchange Value  
to Build Email List 
A landing page (previously called a squeeze page) 
is a website where you exchange your lead magnet 
for an email address. Y ou’re offering something 
valuable enough that your prospective customers 
are willing to trade their email addresses for 
(understanding they will be contacted by you in the 
future.) 
Eben’s landing page was simple: it had a headline 
that presented a problem, a description full of 
curiosity hooks, and a promise to give you all the 
answers for free after you submitted your name 
and email address. 
As a marketer, I want your email address so I can 
send you emails, and you want something from 
me. So what Eben was selling here was this: I will 
teach you the kiss test to find out if she’s ready to 
be kissed, and in exchange, you give me your email 
address. That’s what we’re trading here... we’re 
bartering. Everything that happens inside of a lead 
funnel is an exchange.
3. Thank You Page: Fulfill Promise,  
Build Trust
On the thank you page, you build trust with your 
prospective customers by giving them what you 
said you’d give them. Y ou fulfill on your promise.  
I still remember to this day how stressed out I got 
because I was so scared of putting in my email 
address to find out the kiss test. When I finally did, 
I assumed it was going to be this huge thing, but it 
wasn’t. The kiss test was literally two paragraphs 
(just five sentences!), yet it taught me exactly how 
to tell if a girl wanted to be kissed. 
Basically, the kiss test said that after you walk a girl 
up to her door, put her hair behind her ear. If she 
leans in to your hand, that’s the sign she wants to 
(PAGE CONTINUES)

LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   7
be kissed. If she pulls back or doesn’t lean in, though, that means she doesn’t want to be kissed, and 
you should just say goodnight.
Eben’s lead magnet wasn’t long, yet it was powerful and valuable. If I was single, I would feel less anxious 
the next time I went on a date, thanks to Eben. My trust in him would go up exponentially because I 
received value from him, and I would be more willing to purchase one of his products. At the bottom 
of his thank you page, he showed me I could continue learning from him by buying his ebook. When I 
clicked on his link, I went to his ebook sales page.
4. Sales Page: Offer Product or Service to Build Customer List 
After your leads have received value from you, they are more likely to do business with you. This is the 
best time to offer a product or service to them on your sales page. Offering a product or service right 
away also helps you recoup your ad costs 
quickly and build your customer list.
After I purchased Eben’s ebook, he upselled 
me to his home study course, and then he 
offered me the chance to come to a live 
event. An upsell is another sales page that 
your customer will see after they buy the 
initial product. In essence, you’ve already 
got a hot lead, so this is one of the best 
times to sell your complimentary higher-
end products and services. 
5. Follow-Up Funnel: Communicate 
with List to Build Relationship 
The last part of Eben’s lead funnel was his follow-up funnel: the emails he sent me after he had my email 
address. He not only provided valuable content for free in those emails, but he also offered his products 
and services that he knew would help me, such as his ebook, his home study course, and his live events. 
Because of his lead funnel, he continued to grow his email list so he could market to them without 
paying any advertising cost. After getting help from his kiss test, single men would say, “That was 
amazing. I need more!” and they could receive even more value as they bought his increasingly higher-
priced offers. This would help them move up his “value ladder. ” 
Now that you can see more than just the tip of the iceberg, you can see how Eben’s 5-part lead funnel 
built his $20 million/year business all off of the kiss test! After funnel hacking Eben’s funnel, I finally 
understood how lead funnels worked. As I started to create my own first lead funnels, they looked almost 
identical to his. That’s what funnel hackers do: we model, so I modeled Eben’s lead funnel template. 
My headlines were even similar to his too. They read, “Y ou’re About to Learn a Secret About Marketing 
That Most People Will Never Know, ” or “Y ou’re About to Learn the Secret About Speed Reading That 
Most People Will Never Know. ” Every business and market I was in, I would just plug it into Eben’s lead 
funnel template because it worked. And now, it’s time to dive deeper into each part of the lead funnel 
to understand why it works so well.

LEAD MAGNET: Attract Leads to Build Value
Think of the word “lead magnet” for a minute. It literally means to attract your audience 
with something valuable and lead them to your destination, which, in your case, is to 
your email list. Y our audience will usually find you because they’re either struggling 
with a problem and are actively seeking out information, or they come across your 
information and realize your lead magnet speaks to them and they want more information.
The reason we create lead magnets, though, is to build value for our prospects. When they receive 
value from us for free, they’re more likely to seek out more information from us, meaning they’re more 
likely to trust us enough to buy from us. 
The fastest way to create something really quickly is through information products. If you’ve studied 
with me for a while, you probably know I’m a big fan of info products. I love them! They’re the fastest 
kind of product to create, and they’re done in such a way that gives you authority in your niche. 
But if you’ve never done it before, it may be scary. Y ou might be thinking, “I don’t even know how to 
create something. I’m a chiropractor. How am I going to create a lead magnet?” or “I don’t know how 
to write a book! I’m a dentist. ” 
The key is: it doesn’t have to be hard! It’s actually really simple to create a lead magnet. While we go 
into more detail on creating lead magnets by using text, audio, and video in Chapter 3, keep reading to 
get a better understanding of what a lead magnet is.
It Doesn’t Have to Be Hard. One of my favorite lead 
magnets is from Brendon Burchard. It is literally one piece 
of paper, and on his landing page, he says, “Hey, here’s 
this piece of paper I give CEOs to help them be more 
productive. Y ou want it? Give me your email address and 
I’ll send you this 1-Page Productivity Planner. ” His students 
find immense value in having the exact same tool that 
he gives CEOs. In their minds, if they use the same tool, 
they are one step closer to achieving the same results.  
Keep It Simple. Because you’re going to be creating multiple lead magnets to attract your audience, 
it’s important to keep your process as simple as possible. Some people say to me, “I’m just going to 
make one perfect thing. ” The truth is you may spend a month trying to build one and if it doesn’t work, 
you’re out a lot of time. I always tell them, “No, you need to create a whole bunch of them really fast, 
because you’re have no idea what people are going to respond to. ”
Thankfully, we’ll show you nine ways to make lead magnets fast without writing a book in Chapter 3! For 
now, just train your mind into believing that you will soon be able to create lots of lead magnets quickly. 
CHAPTER 2
Lead Funnel Strategy 


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   9
Sometimes, I make the same lead magnet but give it different titles to attract different people! As you 
can see from the picture, one is called Marketing Secrets Blackbook and the other is called “Marketing 
Secrets Binge Guide. ” But they’re both exactly the same product! I just used a different title and image 
so it appeared they were different. 
Give It Curiosity. In all of the examples you’ve 
seen so far, there’s always an element of curiosity, 
called a “hook. ” It’s that hook that makes people 
want to opt in by giving you their email address. 
In the landing page shown here, you can see that 
our hook is the cool picture of the Marketing 
Secrets Blackbook. The picture just oozes curiosity 
and has you thinking, “What’s inside of that book? 
It’s padlocked! It must be good!” Because of the 
simplicity of the design and the curiosity of the lead 
magnet, this landing page converts at an insane 
55.63%, meaning that more than half of the people 
who see this page choose to opt in. That’s really good!
Some people think that saying, “Hey, if you opt in, I’m going to show you guys how to lose weight” 
builds curiosity. But that statement isn’t original; it’s vague and it’s been said too many times before. 
Now, if you said, “Hey, give me your email address and I’ll show you how I lost 32 pounds while eating 
hot dogs, hamburgers, and ice cream, ” then I’d be curious and say to myself, “That doesn’t make sense. 
I have to know more!” 
Consider how your lead magnet can evoke curiosity by looking at these examples:
Focus on Pain Points. As I was preparing this presentation, one of my favorite people on earth, Myron 
Golden, messaged me and asked me to share a few of his tips with you because they’re so powerful 
when you’re creating your lead magnets. Now, if you’ve ever studied NLP (short for neuro-linguistic 
programming), this is a big part of NLP , and it might sound familiar. In life, people either move toward 
pleasure or away from pain, and this rules almost every decision they make. 
Think about yourself for a second. Do you make most of your decisions trying to move toward pleasure? 
Do you think to yourself, “I’m going to have six-pack abs and look amazing, ” or “I want to get rich so I 
can fire my boss and buy a huge mansion. ” 
Or do you make your decision moving away from pain? Do you think to yourself, “I just hate my job, I 
want to get out of here. If I could make money, I could leave my job and get out of this pain, ” or “I just 
want to eat healthier because I’m tired. I hate people making fun of me. I feel sick all the time. ”

The majority of humans on this planet, by the way, make their decisions moving away from pain. 
However, entrepreneurs usually make their decisions moving toward pleasure. So one of the biggest 
mistakes we make as entrepreneurs is assuming that everyone moves toward pleasure, and therefore 
our lead magnets focus on gaining pleasure, rather than escaping pain. Myron told me his biggest tip is 
to make lead magnets that focus on getting people out of pain, because it’s one of the most powerful 
ways to bring people into your email list. 
Myron then told me his best process to create an info product around pain points. When he created his 
very first lead magnet, he first wrote his headline, “The 12 Biggest Mistakes Network Marketers Make. ” 
Then, he wrote an outline of those 12 mistakes, and finally he recorded himself discussing those 12 
mistakes. The “mistakes” element of his lead magnet focused on the pain people would feel if they did 
network marketing wrong, and that lead magnet built him lists of hundreds of thousands of people. 
It was pretty cool, but what was even cooler came after he gave them the lead magnet. When they 
opted in on his landing page to receive his free “12 Mistakes” video, they went to his thank you page 
where he invited them to join him on a webinar to learn how to cure those mistakes! On the webinar, of 
course, was where he had a chance to actually sell them something. If they didn’t buy, he still had them 
on his email list so he could market to them in the future for free. 
Do you see how simple this is? Are you getting the power of lead funnels yet? As you continue to think 
about what you might create for your lead magnets, start jotting down ideas. I bet you might even have 
something already you could use, so ask yourself, “Do I have a valuable report I’ve written? Have I created 
any videos that would help solve a problem for my audience? Do I have a coupon I can give away?”
If you’re still coming up short, ask yourself, “Can I write a quick report focusing on my audience’s pain 
points? Can I shoot a quick video and talk about something that will benefit my audience? How can I provide 
value to my prospects?” After you’ve written down some ideas, keep reading; we’ll implement in Chapter 3.
 
LANDING PAGE: Exchange Value to Build Email List
Now that we’ve got a good handle on what a lead magnet is, and why we need one, 
let’s move on to the second part of our lead funnel: the landing page! The landing 
page is, if you remember from our history lesson previously, the webpage where you 
will give something away (a lead magnet) in exchange for someone’s email address. 
One of my favorite landing pages is this one from 
Brian Moran where he exchanges his free (with s&h) 
book, The Going Pro Manifesto, for a lead’s email 
address. I love the simplicity of the page design. 
While we’ll go into more detail into how to create an 
effective landing page in Chapter 3, for now, I’d like 
to share with you a vital marketing strategy you 
might not already know.
The Money Is in the List. T o really appreciate 
the importance of a landing page, it’s crucial you 
understand marketing in business: the money is 
in the list. Plain and simple. For whatever reason, 
most entrepreneurs think that the value of their 


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   11
business is in the product they created or even in themselves as the expert leader. But that’s not true. 
The only actual asset inside of your business is your customer list. 
If you look back at the history of big companies, you’ll see this time and time again. I remember the 
very first time I understood this principle was when I learned that eBay bought Skype for $2.6 billion. 
I was shocked, and I thought to myself, “Wait a minute... eBay’s got the best developers in the world. 
They could literally clone Skype in a weekend if they wanted to. Why did they spend $2.6 billion for 
Skype?” Then I realized that Skype had almost 60 million users at the time. They weren’t buying the 
software; they were buying the user base. 
Why did Facebook buy Instagram? Literally, Facebook could have built Instagram in a weekend. 
Instagram had zero revenue, yet Facebook paid $1 billion for it. Why? They wanted the customer base. 
They wanted Instagram’s 30 million users at the time. Again, they wanted the list.
In every business, the list is the salable asset. If I was to sell ClickFunnels someday, guess what they 
would be buying? They wouldn’t be buying a funnel-building software, as amazing as that is. They 
wouldn’t be buying Russell Brunson, my ebooks, my physical products, or my coaching. They would be 
buying the customers who are using the software every day: my list.
Y ou have to grill this into your head: the money is in the list! I’m so grateful that one of my very first 
mentors, Mark Joyner, drilled this into my head over and over again 15 years ago. And because of that, 
that’s been my focus point all along. Of all the marketers who have been in the same business as me 
for the last decade and a half, most of them are gone... most of them disappeared. ClickFunnels has 
surpassed all of them because I had a singular focus on building my customer list. The list is the key!
Marketing Math. Okay, now here’s some marketing math for you to understand about creating your 
email list. If you do this poorly (i.e. simply build your email list and don’t build a relationship with the 
people on it), you will average $1 per month per name on your email list. If you do this well (i.e. build a 
strong relationship with the people on your list), you can average much more than $1 per month per 
name. Obviously, these numbers are estimates; there’s no guarantee you’ll make that. But if you follow 
my training, you should see yourself making at least $1 per month per name, if not even more.
But for now, let’s stick with the scenario of making $1 per month 
per name on your list. That means if you get 1,000 people on 
your list, you should start averaging about $1,000 per month 
in sales. With 10,000 people, you would make about $10,000 per 
month, or $120,000 per year. With 100,000 people, you would 
make about $100,000 per month, or $1.2 million per year, and so on 
and so on. Remember, those numbers are even if you do it poorly.
There’s a direct correlation between the amount you make and the number of people on your email list, 
and these numbers synced in my business as well. I remember when I first got started, somebody told 
me about this correlation. Sure enough, my very first month I got 217 people on my list and that month 
I made like $300. I thought to myself, “Weird... ” When I got to 1,000 people, I was making about $1,000 
per month. When my list grew to 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, and even 1,500,000 
people, my financials synced really close.
Now for most of you, if you follow what I’m teaching in this book, you should actually average a lot 
more. If you actually build a relationship with your list, you should start seeing your average start to 
rise to $3, $5, $10, etc. per month per name. 
SIMPLE MARKETING MATH:
Each name on your 
email list ≈ at least 
$1/month

LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   12
I actually sat down and did the math last night to figure out how much we are currently averaging per 
name. At this time, we are actually averaging just shy of $10 per month per name on my email list. 
Some of you may be a local business owner, though, and are saying to yourself, “Man, Russell, I live 
in Boise, Idaho. I’m not going to be able to get 1,000 people on my email list; that’s like half the town. 
There’s no way I can make that much money. ” But I’m telling you, these numbers are on the low end. 
If you’re a local business, you have that much more ability to grow a personal relationship with people 
because they’re actually visiting your location. Y ou could probably average between $10-$50+ per 
month per name.  
Regardless of my numbers, I wanted to give you the benchmark of $1 per month per name to shoot for. 
That way, you could look at your list and think, “If we added 150,000 people to our list through this lead 
funnel, then I should be making $150,000 per month. ” In theory, you effectively would give yourself 
$150,000 per month raise. Do you see the value in building an email list now? Not everyone will be a 
customer, but you have to build leads first before they can even become a customer. And this landing 
page is the gateway into your email list.
Give Y ourself a Raise. In this business, I always try to ask questions like, “How do I give myself a raise 
every single day?” And the answer to that question is always the same: build my email list and build my 
relationship with them. At the end of the day, that’s what it comes down to: serving my people, because 
they’re all that really matters at the end of the day. And when I go to sell ClickFunnels, that relationship 
that I built with them will be the most valuable asset I have.
Now, if you wanted to give yourself $1,000 per month raise in a traditional business, or $10,000 per 
month raise, or $100,000 per month raise, there would be a long time period before you could actually 
get that kind of return. In fact, if you wanted to become a doctor, you’d have to go to college for like 
12 years just to qualify for that kind of raise. But in online marketing, we just focus on building a list, 
because that’s how we’ll give ourselves a raise every day. That is why we’re teaching you about lead 
funnels. Y our #1 focus should be on growing your email list and developing a relationship with them.
I laugh thinking of this, but if someone asked me, “What do you want for Christmas?” I would reply, “I 
want a thousand leads. ” It’s funny because I look at how much money people invest in real estate, and 
they’ll never get the kind of return I can get from adding more leads into my business. 
For example, imagine you spent $100,000 for a house that will generate $500 per month in cash flow. 
After a year, you would have made $6,000. People do that all day long in real estate, which is great for 
them, I guess. I can’t buy real estate, though, because I would choose to spend my $100,000 to get 
100,000 leads. They’d generate $100,000 per month, which would make me $1.2 million after a year. 
In other words, my ad spend would produce $100,000 return during the same month that their real 
estate purchase would produce just $500. It’s so hard for me to justify real estate because I look 
at those numbers and see that leads are so much more valuable than real estate. I spend the same 
amount of money I would have spent on a house on leads, and they now pay me every single month. It’s 
just a better deal. When you look at adding leads to your business as an investment, it’ll change your 
whole perspective.
Y ou read previously that while building a list is great, in order to make the most money you can with 
your list, you really have to build the relationship with your list. We’ll explain that in more detail in Part 
5 of our lead funnel where we talk about Follow-Up Funnels. For now, let’s move on to the next step of 
our lead funnel: the thank you page! 

LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   13
THANK YOU PAGE: Fulfill on Promise to Build Trust
When someone puts in an email address to get your lead magnet, they’re usually 
super excited to get it. Y ou promised them something in exchange for their email 
address, so now they want to receive that value. The worst thing you can do at this 
point is to do some sort of bait-and-switch where you say, “Buy this product and 
then I’ll give you what you wanted. ” 
Instead, do exactly what you said you would: give them  the lead magnet. The thank you page serves a 
two-fold purpose: deliver the lead magnet (thereby building trust and providing value) and offer your 
lead something to buy that will help them (thereby recouping your ad cost and building your list).
This image shows Brian Moran’s thank you page for his lead magnet: The Going Pro Manifesto. Y ou 
can see that you can download the ebook, and then at the bottom, he tells you to continue to step 
two where he says, “I’m going to show 
you how to get your first 1,000 fans 
on Facebook and Instagram for free 
in just seven days. ” If you just got his 
lead magnet, you’re already primed to 
want more information from him. When 
you click on the “Next Step” button, you 
continue on to his sales page.
Sometimes, my lead funnels don’t 
even sell anything. Do you remember 
my Marketing Secrets Blackbook lead 
magnet? I actually don’t even have a 
sales page after it; I don’t sell anything 
on the back end. If somebody comes 
to the landing page, I ask for their 
email address, and then I take them 
to the thank you page where they 
download it. Instead of sending them 
to a sales page, I simply say, “Hey, 
thanks for signing up. This ebook is a 
compilation of my best episodes on 
my podcast. Be sure to subscribe to 
my podcast. ” 
That’s it; I don’t sell them anything. Instead, I focus on building a relationship with the people who 
just opted in. Y ou see, even though I’m building a huge list of people, those people just barely met me; 
they don’t know who I am, what I believe, or what I stand for yet. A list like that doesn’t make you much 
money. T o fix that, I started my podcast. 
After they subscribe, it’s easy to start building that relationship. They’ve got me plugged into their ears 
and they’re listening to me talk as they go through their daily routines. The woman in the picture on 
the next page is Liz Benny, and, at the time, she (like so many others) was listening to my “Marketing 
Secrets” podcast while she was working out, driving in the car, and taking walks. 
DELIVER LEAD MAGNET AND INTRODUCE
FIRST OFFER

LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   14
Podcasting is how I put out my content, so what happens when she’s listening to me? She actually 
gets to know who I am, understand what I believe, and figure out what I stand for. Can you imagine the 
relationship you could have with someone if they listened to you for 20, 30, or even 40 minutes a day? 
When you have that kind of a relationship, it’s not hard to sell somebody a $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, 
$50,000 or even $100,000 product.
In fact, most of the people who are in my Inner Circle (and give me $50,000 a year) got into my Inner 
Circle through that podcast. Is that crazy? Y ou might be thinking, “But Russell, where’s the R.O.I. on 
podcasting?” The R.O.I. comes after I build a relationship with them, and six months later they give 
me a check for $50,000. Or it comes when they come to Funnel Hacking Live because they heard 
something in one of my episodes that they related to, and then at that event they joined T wo Comma 
Club X because they trusted in me. If you focus on building a relationship, the money will follow.
Do you remember how I talked about averaging $1 per month per name? If you do this poorly, that’s 
what you’ll average. But when you build a relationship with your list like the relationship I create with 
my podcast, then you can see each lead bringing you $2, $5, $10, $20, or even $50 per month. 
SALES PAGE: Offer Product or Service to Build List
Once you click Brian’s “Next Step” button, you land on his sales page, where he 
can then sell you the product or service he wanted to sell you in the first place. 
He couldn’t jump right to selling you straight out of the gate, though. He had to 
warm you up and provide value so you would trust 
what he was offering you. Once he provided value 
with The Going Pro Manifesto, the next logical step 
was to show you how he could continue helping you 
on your journey. 
We won’t be talking in detail about the many ways 
you could sell products; after all, this is a lead 
funnel, not a book funnel, webinar funnel, high 
ticket funnel, or any one of a million other funnels 
you could sell your products or services on. I just 
want you to understand that the sales page is a 
place you can recoup your ad costs by offering info 
products as well as building your customer lists. 
If you’re starting out, though, I don’t want you to 
worry about having a product to sell immediately.

LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   15
A lot of times when you’re building your list initially, you might not have money to spend on ads, so 
you’re building your list for free by getting on podcast interviews, writing on people’s blogs, or doing 
other things to push people to get your lead magnet so you can start building a relationship with them.
Over the long run, though, you’ll want to be able to buy ads, which is why we go into detail in Chapter 
3 on nine ways to create info products fast. But for now, just realize there’s a sales page step that you 
can take out of your lead funnel until you have something to sell.
Now that you understand you don’t have to have a product to sell if you’re just starting out, let’s move 
on to the follow-up funnel where you’ll continue building the relationship with your list.
FOLLOW-UP FUNNEL: Communicate with List to Build Relationship
As we mentioned before, your first goal is to build your email list, and your 
second goal is to build a relationship with the people on that list. The way you 
do that is to continue communicating to your list. Back in the day, the only 
way to do that was via email. Nowadays, you can communicate to your list 
with email, Facebook Messenger, text, and more!
Instead of having to write individual emails or messages to your list, you can 
set up your messages to be automatically sent with a tool inside ClickFunnels called Follow-Up Funnels. 
Most of you already know what a funnel is. We’ve been discussing lead funnels this entire time so you 
know what it looks like for your prospect to go to your landing page, then your thank you page, and then 
your sales page. That’s called a lead funnel, and you’ll build each of those pages inside of ClickFunnels 
in Chapter 3. 
But what’s great is now you can create follow-up funnels that will automatically send your prospects 
the messages you want to send them, when you want to send them. For instance, when people opt in 
for your lead magnet, they give you their email address, so your follow-up funnel would immediately 
send them their very first email with a download link for their lead magnet. Y ou could also add a link to 
subscribe to your podcast in that email as well. 
In your follow-up funnel, you can also choose to have different messages scheduled to be sent out in 
the future. Perhaps two days later, they might get another email from you, and two days after that, they 
might get a text… Y ou can add as many messages to be sent out as you like, and it will send them out 
automatically.
With Follow-Up Funnels, you can also send out broadcasts to your list, so instead of scheduling a bunch 
of automated, pre-created emails, you can also write time-specific emails as well. These emails might 
invite your prospects to an upcoming webinar, a product sale you’re having, or even an open house if 
you’re a local business. At the end of Chapter 3, we’ll go deeper into actually creating your follow-up 
funnel, but for now, let’s dive right in to creating your lead magnet!


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   16
Y ou know the history and strategy behind lead funnels, so now it’s time to dive deep into making one! 
Below, I’ll illustrate the five parts of a lead funnel by using Myron Golden’s tip: lead magnets should 
focus on bringing people away from pain, not toward pleasure. 
A lead magnet is a super valuable tool, report, video (or any number of other things) that attracts your 
audience and literally pulls them into your world and onto your email list so you can better serve them.
If you were a nutritionist, you could make a lead magnet for “The 7 Mistakes Parents Make by Choosing 
Foods They Thought Were Healthy but Are Actually Making Their Kids Fat. ” Because I’m a parent, if I 
saw that lead magnet, I’d say, “Wait, what?” I’d be hooked with curiosity! 
Then, after I opted in on the landing page and became your lead, I would learn the seven mistakes. 
Perhaps one of the mistakes would be, “Y ou thought Nutella was healthy because it has nuts and 
protein, but it’s actually full of sugar!” I would say, “Oh man.. This whole time I’ve been putting Nutella 
on everything for my kids... ” but I learned my mistake, so I received value from your lead magnet. 
On your thank you page, you would tell me about your upcoming web class by saying, “If you liked that, 
you’ll love finding out how to instantly switch out those 12 fatty foods with the 12 best foods for your 
child. Register for my web class now and I’ll show you. ” Boom! Then I would be in your funnel and you 
could sell me any of your products or services within the parenting, kids, coaching, or food market.
STEP #1: Create a Lead Magnet to Build Value
Now it’s your turn to implement and create your own lead magnets! One of the 
fastest ways to do this is to do exactly what Myron did. He focused on the pain 
points his audience was feeling and thought of 12 mistakes they were making that 
were causing them pain. Perhaps you could make a report or a video about “The 7 
Biggest Mistakes That Real Estate Agents Make” or “The 8 Biggest Mistakes People 
Make When T rying to Lose Weight” or whatever your market needs. Simply fill in the blanks: “The (#) 
Biggest Mistakes (Y our Market) Make. ”
Then, just like Myron did, write a little outline, grab your iPhone, teach those mistakes, and you’ll have 
your lead magnet finished. Just outline, record, and boom! Y ou’ve got a lead magnet in less than 15 
minutes. Does that make sense? It’s so easy to create a lead magnet, and here’s nine other fast ways 
to create an info product, too!
I’m going to go through the nine fastest ways to create info products. These nine ways will be broken 
into three parts: text, audio, and video. Inside those parts will be three examples each of how you can 
use either text, audio, or video to create your info product fast! 
It’s important to note that while you could use some of these info products as your lead magnet, most 
are designed to give you both a lead magnet and a product to sell after they’re created. T o do this, just 
make one of the info products below, pull the best piece out of your product, let that become your lead

magnet, then sell the whole product on your thank you page. (Or, in the case of books, you could give 
away the first chapter as your lead magnet.) Y our prospects will be so amazed at what you give away 
for free that they’ll be dying to see what they’ll get when they actually spend money with you!
9 Fast Ways to Create an Info Product 
Without Ever Writing a Book
 
#1 - TEXT: Crowd-Sourced Books Some of you, as soon as you saw the word “text, ” probably just 
freaked out and said, “That’s cool, Russell, but I don’t want to write a book or a report or whatever. 
That’s stressful and hard. ” And it is hard! So instead, I’m going to show you ways you can get books 
written super fast without actually having to write anything. Sound good?
Have you ever heard of the Chicken Soup for the Soul book? It was written by 
Mark Victor Hansen and Jack Canfield. And guess what? They didn’t write a 
word of that book outside of the title. Instead, they found a whole bunch of 
people who had an inspirational story and compiled their stories into a book. 
After the giant success of their first book, they rebranded their book for over 
250 different markets. Do you love horses? There’s Chicken Soup for the 
Horse Lover’s Soul. Have teenagers? T ry Chicken Soup for the T eenage Soul. 
Oh, are you a dentist? Don’t forget about Chicken Soup for the Dental Soul. 
Joined an MLM? Be sure to read Chicken Soup for the Network Marketer’s 
Soul. In almost every market known to man, they made a Chicken Soup for 
the Soul book, and they didn’t have to write any of them. They just had to find 
101 people who had an inspirational story about the same general subject and 
then combined the stories into a book. Those books went on to sell 500 million copies worldwide, all 
because they chose to combine stories into a book. 
Y ou’ve probably seen my own book, 30 Days, right? This book is one of my best-selling products I’ve 
ever created. One night I had it at my house and my kids said to me, “Dad, you wrote another book!?!” 
And I said, “Well, kind of… ” They looked at me and asked, “What do you mean: ‘kind of’?” So I said to 
them, “Well, I wrote the title but the book was just written by 30 people. Each of them wrote a chapter, 
and then I just combined them into a book. ” And my son, Bowen, replied, “Dad, is that cheating?” T o 
which I laughed and answered, “No. That’s not cheating. It’s just a really fast way to create info products. ”
Now, to create your own crowd-sourced book, look for experts in your industry. Have them each write 
a chapter and combine those into a book. If you were in the ketogenic diet market, you could get seven 
ketogenic diet experts to each write a chapter about a certain part of the diet and call it The 7 Mistakes 
People Make on the Ketogenic Diet. After you gave away your book, you could sell ketogenic diet recipe 
books and other products afterward. 
Some of you are thinking right now, “But Russell, I don’t sell ketogenic diets, so that doesn’t work for 
me. ” Right, I get it. But this is where you need to use your brain to look for ways you could serve your 
audience best. What could you do to help your market? Which experts or specialists could you contact 
to ask them to write a chapter in your book? What “hook” will draw your audience in with curiosity? 
Then, compile all their chapters into a book you can put together really quickly.   
PRO TIP!
PRO TIP!

LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   18
#2 - TEXT: Example Books Some of my best-selling books were created by just compiling examples 
from my business. This specific book shown in the image is simply 108 split tests that we ran, then we 
compiled all those examples into a book. 
We’ve also compiled examples into our monthly newsletter we sell. 
Each month, I find two funnels I like, and then I funnel hack them. I put 
the pictures in there, and then we sell the newsletter. 
We also put together a book called The 74 Funnel Swipe File. All we 
did was take screenshots of 74 funnels, and then we combined those 
examples into a book. We even used this book to raise over a million 
dollars for a charity we love!
Oh, and by the way… guess what this book is? It’s a compilation of 
114 unique lead funnel examples. All I did was compile a bunch of my 
favorite lead funnels, give some training about how to make a lead 
funnel, and boom! I created a product that fast! Y ou’ll even see as you 
look at the lead funnel examples in the back of the book that some people even made lead magnets by 
just compiling examples too. For their landing pages, they said, “Here’s 100 of my favorite Facebook ads. 
Opt in to get them all, ” then they would get huge lists based on giving away compilations of examples.
T o create your own example book, what data, reports, or case studies have you already created (or you 
could create quickly) that you could compile into a book? Do you have case studies, pictures, screen 
shots, before/after testimonials, swipe files, ads, email newsletters…? I could go on and on! Gather them 
all together and compile them into a book. Be sure to put a hook in the title to attract your audience.
#3 - TEXT: Public Domain Books The last text example we’ll talk about is making books from the 
public domain. If you’re not familiar with the public domain, they’re basically creative materials (like 
books, movies, plays, songs, photographs, instruction manuals, posters, courses, reports, etc.) whose 
copyright has expired, and therefore you can use them without needing permission. At this moment, 
any creative materials in the United States created before 1923 are now in the public domain. It’s great 
for you because you can just grab them, slap your label on them, and publish them as your own. 
One of the most popular books in the public domain currently is Think 
and Grow Rich. Even though it was published after 1923, it fell into the 
public domain because its copyright wasn’t renewed. Now you can take it, 
rebrand it for your market, and give it away for free without ever having to 
write the book! Y ou could call it: Think and Grow Rich for Internet Marketers, 
Think and Grow Rich for Dentists, or Think and Grow Rich for (your market). 
Simply add a chapter yourself by explaining how the principles in the book 
relate to your audience, and boom! Y ou can have a book ready to give away. 
Y ou might be saying to yourself, “I can’t do that Russell. That feels like 
stealing. ” It’s not stealing, and yes, you can do that. According to the law, 
you’re able to do it because the creative work was either made before 
1923 or its copyright has expired and it’s fallen into the public domain. So 
therefore, you can make a derivative work out of it.
“Russell that seems shady. ” Okay then, was Walt Disney shady? All he’s ever done is find stories in the 
public domain and turn them into movies. He makes derivative works and therefore doesn’t have to 
pay anyone royalties or licenses because they’re all in the public domain. 


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   19
Have you heard of Frozen? It’s from a little story called “The Snow Queen” that was in the public domain. 
How about The Little Mermaid or Beauty and the Beast? He took the ideas for both of those movies 
(and many more ideas) from the public domain. In fact, at least 50 of his movies stemmed from stories 
in the public domain. Y ou can do the same thing because there’s more creative materials in the public 
domain than you can ever dream of.
One of my friends, Matt Furey, found an old wrestling book from 1914 by this guy named Farmer Burns. 
He took the book, republished it, and made millions of dollars selling the book. 
T o create your own book quick, go to gutenberg.org or ebay.com to find someone else’s unprotected 
work that you can repurpose as your own.  On gutenberg.org you can find over 58,000 ebooks on 
the site for free. Their mission is to find as many public domain books and house them in one site for 
everyone to find. Y ou can search for books in your specific market and see if you can find a book that 
you can republish and use as your lead magnet.
Y ou can also go to ebay.com and search by publication years for non-fiction books. Just choose books 
that have been published before 1923, and then find one that can work for your audience. There’s 
even a company that will take your book, scan it, and turn it into an ebook for you. Boom! Now you’ve 
created an info product that quick as well!
Now that you’ve learned about creating info products fast with the written word, I want to teach you 
an important concept before we move into the audio and video sections. When you’re trying to hook 
someone to opt in for your lead magnet, you need to make sure they view it as something valuable. 
Oftentimes, people don’t opt in if they don’t see the value in what you’re providing. So how do you 
increase the value? Y ou can package it in a different way. Instead of just creating something with text, 
you can package the same content into an audio or video format, therefore raising its value.
#4 - AUDIO: Audio Books My favorite example of packaging the same content in different ways also 
has to do with Think and Grow Rich, which we talked about earlier. I remember when I first started going 
to marketing events, everyone would talk about this book. “Have you read Think and Grow Rich?” they’d 
ask me. I had never heard of it before, so I went to Amazon and bought it for something like $9.97 . I had 
great intentions to read it, but after setting it on the shelf next to my bed, it sat there for a month. 
Later, I went to another marketing event, and three people from stage said, “Have you read Think and 
Grow Rich? Y ou need to read Think and Grow Rich!” In the audience, I said to myself excitedly, “Nice! 
It’s on my bookshelf. I’ll read it when I get home. ” After I went home, though, I looked at it once and 
then promptly fell asleep without reading it. A couple of months later, I went to another event, and the 
same thing repeated itself for almost a year. Finally, at one of the events, I thought to myself, “This is 
embarrassing. I’m not doing what I’m supposed to be doing. ” I don’t like 
to read as much, so I wondered if there was an audiobook. Now, this was 
about 15 years ago, so Audible wasn’t even a thing back then. 
Because eBay was my favorite site, I went to ebay.com and typed in 
“Think and Grow Rich” where I found a CD course of the book. Because 
it’s in the public domain, someone took the book, recorded himself 
reading it, turned it into a CD course, and sold it on eBay for $97 . I was 
so excited that I could finally “read” Think and Grow Rich that I bought it 
right away, even though I had the exact same thing sitting on my shelf. 
Once I got the CDs, I played them in my car. After a week and a half, I had 
consumed the information and got incredible value from it.


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   20
Now what’s interesting is this: Think and Grow Rich sold on Amazon for $9.97 , yet on eBay it sold for 
$97 . Was there a difference between the two versions? No. Word for word they were the same. The only 
difference was how the product was delivered. Because it was an audio course, instead of a book, it 
could be sold for a higher price; the value increased because it was packaged differently.
That’s what I want you to really understand. Sometimes you can increase the value of your info product 
or lead magnet just by packaging it in a different way. T o give you an example, if your audience was 
dentists, you could record yourself talking about dental stories and how Think and Grow Rich applies 
to dentistry. Then you could package up the audio recording with the Think and Grow Rich ebook, and 
boom! Y ou’d have a sexy offer to give to dentists. In fact, I could even do that right now for my funnel 
hackers: Think and Grow Rich for Funnel Hackers!
Another example of how you can record an audio book and turn it into an info product or lead magnet 
is when I recorded one of my very first audio books: Life Work of Farmer Burns. I found it on eBay, and 
because it was published in 1911 (which is before 1923), it was in the public domain. I gave it to my 
father-in-law who has an amazing radio voice, and he went down to the radio station and read the 
entire book. I put it on CDs, and it became one of my very first products I ever sold.
Just as I created an audiobook from a book in the public domain, you can do it too. In fact, you can even 
give your audio book away as your lead magnet and start building your lead funnel very, very quickly 
just making audiobooks. 
#5 - AUDIO: Interview Recordings I remember reading a book called 12-Month Millionaire and 
learning how a guy named Vince James made $100 million in 23 months selling supplements through 
direct mail. I thought to myself, “That dude’s awesome. I’d love to talk to him, but he’ll never talk to me, 
though, because I’m this little dorky college kid who doesn’t know what I’m talking about. Maybe he 
will, though… ” I thought, and set off to email him. 
After praising his book, I asked him if I could interview him because his book had some really good stuff 
and I had some questions. He wrote back, said yes, and asked when was a good day for the interview. 
I wrote back, “How about Saturday?” and he said “Great!” He let me interview him for three hours on 
that Saturday, and by the time we wrapped up, he asked, “Do you have any more questions?” I said yes, 
so then he said, “Well, I gotta go, but how about we do this next Saturday, so you can ask me some more 
questions. ” I replied, “Are you serious!?!”
We talked again the next Saturday, and I interviewed him for three more hours. At the end, I had spent 
six hours interviewing this guy who made $100 million on the concepts I learned in his book. He told 
me I could keep the audio recordings and do whatever I wanted with 
them, and he just asked if I could send him a copy, too, so he could sell 
them to his list. Of course I said yes!
About a year later, I was struggling to figure out how to get people 
to buy my stuff, so I put the six hours of audio recordings with Vince 
James into a funnel to sell. That funnel was the first funnel I ever made 
to hit the T wo Comma Club!
In fact, most of my products are just interviews with people who 
are experts in the topic I want to sell to. I could easily do a lead 
funnel where I say to my audience, “Hey, do you want to learn 
the trial close? I interviewed the guy I learned trial close from. 


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   21
Give me your email address and I’ll give you this audio. ” And just like that, I could have a lead magnet 
so fast. 
In your market, who’s written books? Could you call and interview them? Could that become your lead 
magnet in your new lead funnel? It’s literally so simple and so easy. Interviewing experts is one of the 
fastest ways to create info products and get a really powerful lead magnet. 
#6 - AUDIO: Hard-To-Find Audio Compilations The last way to create info products quickly with 
audio is to compile some of your favorite podcasts. Have you ever tried to find a podcast episode that 
someone told you about? It’s difficult, isn’t it? If I was to come to you and say, “Hey, I listened to this 
podcast interview by one of my favorite authors. In the interview, he talked about (training), and it was 
amazing. ” Y ou would probably immediately reply, “That’s amazing. What episode is it?” 
While it would probably take me some time to find it, it would probably take you even longer to find it. 
I might say, “I don’t know; let me go find it. He’s done like 700 podcast episodes. Actually, shoot me 
your email address and then when I find it, I’ll shoot you the link to what episode it is. ” Y ou would be 
so grateful that you didn’t have to go through all the headache of listening to 700 episodes to find the 
right one. 
Y ou can do the exact same thing for your audience. For instance, on your landing page for your lead 
funnel, you could say, “Hey, of all of Gary Vaynerchuk’s trainings, this one podcast episode changed 
everything for me. If you give me your email address, I’ll shoot you a direct link to that podcast episode. 
That way you can listen it, because if you’re struggling like I was, this will change everything for you. ” 
Boom! I made a lead magnet off of somebody else’s free content. 
Y ou don’t have to be limited to just compiling your favorite podcast episodes, though. Y ou can do it with 
blog posts, Y ouT ube videos, or any number of other resources that you find valuable. Y ou become the 
expert because you’re compiling the best information for your audience so they don’t have to do the 
work themselves. Literally, this one takes about 5 seconds. It’s so easy. In fact, you should even make 
a lead funnel with my best podcast episodes that mean the most to you. Then, you can give it away as 
your lead magnet and sell ClickFunnels on your thank you page and in your follow-up funnel. 
#7 - VIDEO: Screen Captures If you’ve never done a video recording your screen, you might be 
confused how to do it. The great news is it’s super easy! 
For probably the first eight years of my business, all 
I did was create screen capture videos. Every single 
product I created was a screen capture. I’d make an 
outline, just like the one you see in this picture, and 
record my screen as I went through the outline. This is 
the very first Funnel Hacks training course we did, and 
it literally sold over $10 million before we updated the 
training. On the left-hand side, I had a Word document 
with the outline of what I wanted to talk about. On the 
right-hand side, I had an example. Then I would just 
talk, show an example, and repeat the process until I 
had gone through my entire outline. I made $10 million 
by just recording my screen and talking!


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   22
Y ou can easily do the same thing and create a lead magnet like Myron did. Remember to create a title 
like “The 7 Biggest Mistakes Network Marketers Make, ” write an outline of those seven mistakes on 
your computer, and record yourself going through the outline. Now, the perceived value of your lead 
magnet video is higher than audio and text. Y ou can say to your audience, “ Just give me your email 
address and you’ll get a video explaining the seven biggest mistakes… ” It’s super powerful!
How do you actually record your screen, though? Easy! First, make an outline or a powerpoint slide and 
have it showing on your screen. Then, download Camtasia (if you’re on a PC) or ScreenFlow (if you’re 
on a Mac). Plug in a headset microphone and click record. It will record your screen and you talking to 
yourself as you go through the outline. When you’re finished, simply press stop to end the recording. In 
just a few minutes, you’ve created a great lead magnet to give away.
#8 - VIDEO: iPhone How To’s Y ou probably have an iPhone or some 
other type of smartphone, right? Every one of these smartphones 
has a camera with a little button that says record, so you can literally 
pull out your phone, click record, and just talk into it. My friend, Rachel 
Pedersen, recently created an entire expensive course with just her 
camera on her iPhone! If she can do an entire course, you can record 
a simple video. 
T o quickly make your lead magnet, repeat the same process we’ve 
been discussing above by creating an outline, and then just record 
a video of yourself on your iPhone going through the outline. It’s 
even faster than doing a screen capture because you don’t have to 
download anything. Just open up your camera, press record, and talk!
#9 - VIDEO: Workshops The last way to create an info product fast is to hold a workshop. Now, 
usually you would sell a workshop as a higher-priced product later in your funnel. But the great thing 
about holding a workshop is it can create not only a product for you, but also a lead magnet. In this 
case, your lead magnet can be the first hour of your training or a specific training inside your workshop, 
while your entire workshop can still be sold as a product later on.
For instance, if you looked at the last Funnel Hacking Live, you may have noticed something interesting. 
It was a three-and-a-half-day event, but during the very first presentation (my keynote presentation), I 
streamed it live for everyone to see for free. Why did I do that? Because everyone who wasn’t at Funnel 
Hacking Live saw it and thought, “Oh my gosh, this was so much better than I thought!” 
When I cut off the live stream, they freaked out and said, “Oh man, I have such a fear of missing out 
(FOMO) right now! What else is happening at Funnel Hacking Live? What else am I missing out on?” 
Then, when I told them, “Hey, you should buy tickets for next year because you’re missing out on this 
year, ” they immediately jumped at the chance to buy tickets. We sold over 1,000 tickets to people before Funnel 
Hacking Live even ended, just because of FOMO! 
Imagine if you created a workshop where you trained a whole bunch of people in your industry on 
whatever training they needed, and then you offered part of that workshop for free as your lead magnet. 
Y ou could take the very first presentation and say, “If you want to watch the first hour of my amazing 
workshop where I teach you how to (your training), put in your email and I’ll give you the first hour of 
my $2,000 workshop. ” 


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   23
When they watch it, they’re going to get all this FOMO and think, “Oh my gosh, that was amazing! I 
wonder what else is inside the course... ” Then it’s a natural fit to sell your workshop to them in your 
follow-up funnel. By holding one workshop, you’ve created a lead magnet to give away and an info 
product you can later sell on your thank you page or in your follow-up funnel.
I hope you’ve seen as we’ve gone through nine different ways to quickly create info products that we 
weren’t just talking about creating lead magnets; we were talking about creating info products. After 
you make an info product, you can pull out your best piece and turn it into a lead magnet. Then, you can 
sell your whole info product as your first product! Y ou’re basically telling your audience, “If you liked 
this lead magnet, then you’ll love this product!”
STEP #2: Create a Landing Page to Build Email List
After you’ve created your lead magnet, you’re ready to start building your 
email list! We’ve got some great ideas below for how to build your email list for 
free, but before we can do that, we need to actually build your landing page. 
Remember, landing pages are simple. All you’re doing is an exchange. Y ou’re 
saying, “If you give me your email address, I will give you this super valuable 
(your lead magnet) in exchange. ” 
One of my favorite lead funnels that I’ve already shared with you is for Brian Moran’s The Going Pro 
Manifesto lead magnet. I wanted to discuss his landing page in greater detail here, though, because it’s 
so clean and simple. He is exchanging his little ebook for an email address. It’s a very simple exchange, 
and it’s a great example of what a high-converting landing page looks like. 
Now pay attention, because we’re about to create your own landing page, and what I’m going to tell 
you next will help you increase your opt-in rate. When people come to me asking why their landing 
page isn’t converting, they usually didn’t follow one (or more) of my three cardinal rules when creating 
landing pages.
First, keep it simple. Most of my landing pages only have a headline, an image, and an opt-in box. 
That’s it. My landing pages usually don’t have any other images or even videos. Often times, a landing 
page might not convert because it’s too complex; there’s just too much stuff happening on it and it’s 
confusing your visitor.


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   24
Second, build curiosity. It’s human nature that people want to be wowed, amazed, entertained, and 
shocked. In order for them to stop what they’re doing and actually care about what you’re trying to 
offer them, they have to believe it is something valuable that can help them escape pain. If your landing 
page isn’t converting, it might be because there’s not enough curiosity. Y ou haven’t created something 
new or novel; you’ve either offered what everyone else offers or you haven’t done a good enough job 
convincing your visitor they need what you’re offering. 
Third, tell them what to do. Even though opt-in forms are everywhere, people still need to be told what 
to do. On your landing page, be sure it says something to the effect of, “T o get (your lead magnet), 
simply put in your email address and I’ll send it right away. ” Y our landing page might not convert if 
there’s too many things going on, and the visitor doesn’t know what to click or do. Make it a no-brainer 
for them and you’ll see conversions go up!
Before we move on, I want you to pause reading and flip to the back of this book. Start looking through 
all the examples and notice if they are simple, if they build curiosity, and if they tell you what to do. Do 
you think they would convert well? Then come right back and continue reading.
Speaking of conversions, this is my highest-
converting lead funnel. I’ve already talked 
about my Marketing Secrets Blackbook, but 
now you can see how my landing page meets 
my three rules.
First, it’s so simple. There’s no fancy design. 
It’s literally a headline, a picture of what 
they’re going to get, and the opt-in form. 
Second, it builds tons of curiosity. Check out 
that image! Doesn’t it just scream at you to 
try to open it? Are you thinking to yourself, 
“What secrets are inside that are going to 
change my business and life!?! I have to 
know!” And third, I tell them exactly what 
to do right above the opt-in box. The more 
simple, the more curiosity, and the more 
clear the goal... the higher your conversions 
are going to be.
Our conversions are insane with this landing page! In the last seven or eight months that we ran this 
landing page, we generated 148,000 leads from this funnel! Now, a good landing page will usually 
convert at around 20-30%, but this landing page converts at 55.63%! More than half of the people 
who land on this page actually give me their email address, and that’s really, really high.
Now it’s your turn to build out your landing page using ClickFunnels. Be sure it has an intriguing headline, 
an image of your lead magnet, and an opt-in form. Keep it simple, build curiosity with your lead magnet 
and headline, and tell them to enter their email address to get their lead magnet. Don’t spend all day 
on this, though. Y ou should probably spend no more than five to ten minutes creating a landing page, 
because you don’t know if it will convert yet. Better to create it quickly, test it, and then tweak it later to 
see which version will convert better.

Use These 2 Easy Ways to Build Your 
Email List for Free
Now that you have you lead magnet and landing page created, it’s time to think about building your 
list! Y ou might not have money to spend on ads yet, but keep in mind that you’ll want to move in that 
direction soon in order to really build your email list fast. For now, though, I’ll share several great ideas 
for building your email list for free!
The first free option is to get interviewed on the podcast of someone who already has the ear of your 
dream customers. Which experts in your market are doing podcasts? Y ou could ask if you could share 
with their audience “The 7 Biggest Mistakes That (Y our Audience) Make. ” 
Then, when you’re finishing the interview, they’ll usually ask, “How can my listeners learn more about 
you?” If I were being interviewed, I would reply, “Well, the best way is to get a free copy of my book. Just 
go to marketingsecrets.com/blackbook and it will give you 99 secrets that will change your business 
and your life. ” For the listeners who just received value from you on the podcast, you can bet they would 
be heading right over to your landing page to receive your free lead magnet!
The second free option is to become a guest blogger on a blog that is big in your industry. Most bloggers 
or experts always appreciate free content, especially if it can help their audience. Simply reach out and 
ask if you can write an article on their blog. Guest bloggers usually have a bio, so in the bio I might write, 
“If you want to learn more from Russell, you need to read his Marketing Secrets Blackbook. Y ou’ll learn 
99 ways to change your business and your life. Just go to marketingsecrets.com/blackbook to get your 
FREE copy. ” 
Not only will you add value for the expert bloggers, but their readers will undoubtedly love what they 
read as well and come primed to give you their email address for your lead magnet. And honestly, it’s 
just good business practice to develop great relationships with the other experts in your industry. Y ou 
never know what great partnerships and joint ventures will come of building those relationships as well!
STEP #3: Create a Thank You Page to Build Trust
Now that you’ve created your lead magnet and landing page, you’ll need a thank you 
page to tell your visitors how they can get your lead magnet. Sometimes, it’s only 
emailed to them, but I prefer to add immediate value and prove to them I’m giving them 
what I promised, so I put the download link right onto the thank you page. 
Just as your landing page needed to be simple, build curiosity, and tell people what to do, your thank 
you page is no different. Have only two objectives on the page: deliver your lead magnet, and push your 
prospects to your first offer. That might be a product, but if you’re still starting out, it’s most likely an 
invitation to subscribe to your podcast or Y ouT ube channel or blog.
PRO TIP!
PRO TIP!

LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   26
I love the simplicity of this thank you page from DigitalMarketer. They told me the lead magnet would 
be emailed to me, and invited me to get some email templates and training. When I clicked on the 
“Grab Our Email T emplates and T raining” button, I went to their sales page. While there, I was told to 
follow three simple steps: Download my lead magnet immediately, redeem even more free training, 
and buy their product: DigitalMarketer Lab. 
Consider the three rules of landing pages when creating your thank you page, and go ahead and get 
started. Y ou’ll build out the page in ClickFunnels just as you did your landing page. Be sure to put an 
invitation on the thank you page for your prospect to continue with you, whether that’s subscribing to 
other free content or purchasing your first offer.
STEP #4: Create a Sales Page to Build List
Y our Product Should Pay for Y our Ads. We’ve talked a lot about ways to build 
your email list for free, but as you know, your goal should be to eventually buy ads. 
Y our ads will send traffic to your landing page, which will help you build your list 
fast. If you don’t have a product yet, feel free to skim over this section so you’ll have a good understanding 
of how you can recoup your ad costs and build your customer list when you do have a product.
Of course, if you do have a product to sell, this sales page is where you’ll sell it. And with a product to 
sell, you can start buying ads. Some of you are probably nervous and thinking, “I can’t afford to build a 
list, Russell, ” or “I don’t know how it’s going to work. ” If you understand some of these core principles, 
though, it’s really not that difficult.
In our market, it typically costs us between $1-$3 to get a lead. I remember the first time I ever heard 
it costs a couple bucks to get a lead. It was about fourteen years ago, and I thought to myself, “What? I 
can’t pay money per lead. That’s insane. If I get a list of 1,000 people, it’ll cost me at least $1,000. ”
It didn’t make sense to me, though, until I started understanding this one simple trick: your lead funnel 
will pay for your leads. In other words, the product you sell on your thank you page should immediately 


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   27
recoup your ad costs. Do you understand how powerful that is? Effectively, then, you’ll be getting free 
leads that you can market to forever for free. I buy up to 1,700 leads per day, but because our leads buy 
some of our products inside of our lead funnels, the products pay for our ad costs, giving us free leads 
in the end. 
By putting a self-liquidating offer (SLO) on your sales page, you have the chance to immediately make a 
sale after someone opts in. For instance, if you spent $100 to get 100 leads, and 10% of people bought 
your $10 product, then your “offer” would be self-liquidating, meaning that the money you spent to 
drive traffic to your lead magnet was recouped by the offer. Y ou spent $100, and then you made $100, 
which cancelled each other out. Y ou neither lost money nor gained money. But from that point on, you 
would have 100 leads that you effectively paid $0 to get and could market to them forever for free.
Once your lead funnel is fine-tuned like the scenario above, where it can generate leads for free, then 
you would buy as many ads as you possibly could to start growing your list. Y ou can buy ads from 
Facebook, Y ouT ube, Instagram, Google, and lots of other places. 
Now, let’s say that you haven’t made a product to sell yet. Y ou can be an affiliate of someone else’s 
product. We have some amazing affiliate offers at ClickFunnels, so be sure to add in our offers in your 
lead funnel so you can start recouping some of your ad money. Y ou can say on your thank you page, 
“Oh my gosh, I love Russell Brunson’s product because (your reasons.) If you buy it from me, I’m going 
to give you a really cool bonus that (your bonus features), and I’ll send it to you for free if you buy it 
through my affiliate link. ”
Breaking Even After Day One. But what if you buy ads and your lead funnel doesn’t break even? 
What if your product isn’t converting that great, or you only have a “subscribe to my (podcast/blog/
vlog)” link on your thank you page? Y ou’d probably start freaking out, thinking, “After day one, I’m 
already in the hole. I don’t know how long I can keep paying for ads if I’m just going to get deeper and 
deeper into the hole. Maybe I just need to stop the leads... ”
In that situation, we want you to break even as soon as possible after the lead opts in. The only way 
you can do that is to continue the conversation with your follow-up funnel. Y ou can reach out to them 
via email, text, Messenger, etc. and share your messages with them. The more you communicate, the 
better the relationship will be with your list, which means you’ll have a better chance to break even on 
day two or day three.
 For instance, if you spent $100 to get 100 leads, but only 5% of people bought your $10 product, 
then you would have spent $100 on ads and only made $50. Y our “thank you page offer” is not self-
liquidating at that point, and you’re in the hole. However, if you built a great follow-up funnel, your 
prospects would receive emails and texts and other messages with links to your podcast episodes, 
your Facebook Lives, your webinars, and any other awesome content you could send them. Perhaps 
another 5% of those 100 leads would buy your product by day three because you built up more trust 
with them. 
At that point, you would have spent $100 for the original leads, made $50 on your first offer, and 
made another $50 from your follow-up funnel. Y our ad cost and revenue would cancel each other out, 
meaning you would break even on day three. Everything that happens from that point forward with 
those leads would be pure profit. Y ou can relax about being in the hole for a few days, because you 
know you’re going to recoup the costs on day three. From that point on, you don’t have to pay Google 
or Zuckerberg to market to those same leads because they’re in your follow-up funnel. Y ou just need to 
repeat the process to keep building your list with new leads and building your relationship with them!

LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   28
Another way to view R.O.I. is to consider the average value of your leads. If you average $1 per month 
per name on your list, then if you spent $3 to acquire a lead, you would break even on that lead in 
month three. And that’s if you’re doing a poor job of communicating with your list. If, however, you 
communicated regularly to your list and increased your average to $3 per month per name, you would 
break even after one month. Every month after that is pure profit in your pockets.
One company that hired me as a consultant has a six-month break-even point. They make about $70-
$80 million per year, and it takes them six months to recoup their costs on a lead. They’re a lot braver 
than me to wait six months to recoup their ad costs! They have faith in their system because they 
know that everything they make after six months with that lead is pure profit. And because they know 
their marketing math, they can dump tons of money into ads and feel confident that their leads will be 
profitable after six months.  
Now for most of us, we don’t have the ability to 
float money for six months, and I understand 
that. Inside ClickFunnels, we try to break 
even on day one. That’s always my goal. 
Sometimes we don’t break even until day 
three or sometimes day five, but I always try 
to break even on day one by having our lead 
funnels structured exactly as I’m teaching you 
in this book. 
T o create your sales page inside ClickFunnels, 
keep it simple, with a curiosity-based hook 
headline, some descriptive text about the 
product, an image, and an order form. 
STEP #5: Create a Follow-Up Funnel to Build Relationship
The final step to finish creating your lead funnel is to create your follow-up funnel. Do you remember 
how we talked about a program called Follow-Up Funnels inside of ClickFunnels? It will help you 
automate all the messages you want sent out to your lists. That way, you don’t have to personally send 
out individual emails, Facebook messages, or texts every day to communicate and build the relationship 
with your list. 
Not only will I explain how to set up your follow-up funnel, I’ll also 
explain how you can quickly and easily create content for those emails, 
Facebook messages, and texts. Y ou’ll be building deep relationships 
with your prospects and customers in no time, which in turn will start 
to increase the average amount you’ll make per name on your list!
Follow-Up Funnels Are Like Sales Funnels. Y ou’ve probably seen 
this image from me before. It’s called a sales funnel. At the top, all 
of the traffic comes in and is funneled down into each of your steps. 
A large percentage of people give their email address, a smaller 
percentage buy your first product, an even smaller percentage 
buys your higher-priced products, and so on. Lots of people come 
in through your free offerings, and less people funnel down into your 
higher-end products and services. 


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   29
Now that you’ve created all your funnel pages for your lead funnel, you should be able to see where 
each of your pages plug into this image. At the top, you have your free lead magnets; next, you have 
your “lead capture” with your landing page; and finally, your “sales process” is your thank you page and 
sales page. When you create them inside ClickFunnels, your first two pages should look like this with 
your lead magnet and your thank you page.
Now that you have a visual guide of what your lead funnel looks like in the ClickFunnels editor, you’ll 
notice that the follow-up funnel is built the same way. Instead of creating pages, though, you’re just 
creating messages. Where “Page 1, Page 2, Page 3, etc. ” makes sense to you, a follow-up funnel is simply 
“Message 1, Message 2, Message 3, etc. ” We even designed it to look the same. 
Just as a sales funnel directs your traffic to the pages you want them to go, a follow-up funnel directs 
your list to additional messages that you want them to see. With both funnels, you’re in control of 
what your traffic sees and does, and in what order they take the next steps. T o illustrate this, this is an 
example of a follow-up funnel you could create when someone joins your list. 
Email Messages. As soon as they opt in to your list, boom! They’re added right away to the first 
message on your list. In this case, it’s the thank you email with a link to their download and an invitation 
to subscribe or purchase. T wo days later, they’ll receive a text from you. T wo days after that, they’ll 
receive a different email, and so on. Y ou have the option to choose which type of message will be sent 
out, and when it will be automatically sent out. Y ou can have your follow-up funnel go for as long as you 
can keep creating content for it!
Y ou might notice we call this a follow-up funnel, not an email campaign. While email is the core of 
most people’s follow-up funnels, it’s not the only way to communicate with your list and build your 
relationship. Follow-Up Funnels can send out a wide variety of messages... not just email. In fact, it can 
send out a whole bunch of cool messages, such as Facebook messages, desktop push notifications, 
funnel messages, text messages, and retargeting messages. This way, you can meet your prospects 
online where they’re already hanging out.


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   30
Facebook Messages. For example, when somebody comes here to 
this landing page, they enter their email address to get my lead magnet. 
Do you see the Facebook Messenger option right below it though? It 
asks them if they want to send it to Messenger as well. If they click it, 
they will also subscribe to Messenger. This way, I get them on two lists: 
email and Messenger. I can communicate to them in both places and 
have a higher likelihood of building that relationship. 
In ClickFunnels right now, we have more than 75,000 users. And what’s 
interesting is that 34% of the people who add email also subscribe to 
Facebook Messenger. That means that out of 1,000 people who join 
my email list, 340 of them will also join my Messenger list. 
Do you see the power in having one in three of your prospects being 
added to your own Messenger list? Messenger has a three to five times 
higher open rate than email! Sometimes your email might go to their 
junk folder, and they would never see it; if you have them on Facebook 
Messenger, though, it will buzz on their phone so there’s a higher 
likelihood they’ll see your message. With that information, every single person on your Messenger list 
is worth three times more to you than those just on your email list. Having access to this tool is amazing, 
and you’ll find it inside Actionetics MD.
Desktop Push Notifications. Y ou may have seen these pop up from time to time in your browser. 
This is another way you can communicate with your list in follow-up funnels. If you add this, you can 
have this pop up in your prospects’ browsers, and it will ask to “Show notifications. ” If your prospect 
clicks “Allow, ” then you can actually push notifications into their browser, which looks like a message 
simply popping up in their browser from you. 
We do this on the thank you page of all of our funnels. So after they’ve given us their email address, 
we ask them to allow us to push notifications to them. Guess what? T wenty percent of people who hit 
our thank you page click “Allow, ” so now I have a third list I can market to and build a relationship with. 
Do you see how this works? Everything layers on top of each 
other. Not only do you have an email list, but you also have a 
Facebook Messenger list and a desktop push notification list. 
Now, you can communicate to your lists in multiple places 
and in multiple ways. The more ways you communicate to 
your prospect, the more valuable your lead becomes. 
Retargeting Messages. There are tons of other messages you can set up in your follow-up funnels, but 
I’m not going to go too deep into them in this book. I will mention, however, our retargeting messenger, 
because it’s pretty cool. It works like this: once someone lands on one of your funnel pages, you can

RFMS Score. Not only does your follow-up funnel save you time and builds a relationship with your 
list, it also provides you with valuable information inside of Follow-Up Funnels. Within each person’s 
contact record, you can see how valuable each person is to you. Each person is given an action score, 
called an RFMS Score. We’ll explain that more in detail below, but for now, let’s understand what kind 
of data is collected and analyzed to produce this action score.
When a person opts in for your lead magnet, Follow-Up Funnels automatically searches social media 
sites for that email address. If it can find a match, the matched sites will show up on the person’s 
contact record. If your prospect used the same email he/she logs into Facebook with, that person 
would have a Facebook logo on their contact record. It even shows you how many people follow them 
on Facebook and Instagram! 
As you can imagine, that information alone is incredibly valuable, as it shows you way more about the people 
in your list than simply just showing you their email addresses. For instance, someone who has 100,000 
followers on Facebook is more valuable to you than someone who has 1,000 followers on Facebook.
Each person’s contact record also tracks their messaging opens and clicks, as well as when and what 
they’ve purchased from you. Follow-Up Funnels takes all of the data I just mentioned (and much 
more!) and pulls it back into each person’s contact record. Then, it gives that person an action score. 
It analyzes the data and gives each person a Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value, and Social (RFMS) 
Score. As you can see from the image, there are four bands for each part of the RFMS Score, and, when 
combined, they give the actual RFMS Score for that person. The higher the score, the more valuable 
the lead. 
First, the recency score is determined by how often people have interacted with you. Are they opening 
every one of your emails? Did they buy something last week? How recently have they listened to you? If 
they haven’t opened an email from you in seven months, then the recency score would go down along 
with the action score. 
Second, the frequency score increases as people interact with you more frequently. How often are they 
buying from you? Are they buying something once a year, once a month, once a week, or once a day? 
The more frequently they buy from you, the higher their frequency score goes up. 
Third, the monetary value score is determined by how much people spend with you. The person who 
spends one dollar with you obviously receives a lower score than the person who spends $50,000 with you. 
And last, the social score increases when people give you their social media email address. After all, 
it’s probably not a junk email address; they use it to login to their social media accounts, which means 


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   32
they probably check it pretty frequently. When somebody gives you their social media email address, 
they’re worth 80 times more than somebody who just gives you a throwaway email address. Follow-
Up Funnels immediately pings Facebook and other sites to see if the email addresses match. If they 
match, the social score increases dramatically.
When you look at the action scores of the people in your list, you’ll be able to determine if you’re doing 
a good job serving your audience. If their RFMS scores are high, then you’re doing a great job with 
building the relationship with your list. In fact, inside ClickFunnels, I can tell which of my customers are 
really killing it because the action scores of their customers are way higher than those on my list who 
are struggling. 
I hope you’ve been able to see how powerful Follow-Up Funnels can be for your business. It helps you 
send out automated emails, reach your lists in multiple places and ways, shows you how valuable and 
engaged your list is, and so much more!
Now it’s time for you to create your own follow-up funnel. Decide which messages you want your 
prospects to receive (and when you want them to receive them) after they opt in for your lead magnet. 
Then add those messages to your follow-up funnel.
Create 3 Types of Content in 1 Fell Swoop
If you’ve been around me or this community for very long, you know that I talk a lot about publishing. 
Y ou have to be publishing every day. Literally, I want you creating content every day from this point 
on. After all, creating content for your audience to consume is the best way for them to get to know 
who you are, what you believe, and what you stand for. If any of you are stressing about the idea of 
publishing, you’re not alone. 
Some of you may know Steve Larsen. Currently, he’s one of our T wo Comma Club X coaches, and he’s 
been killing it for the past few years. But he wasn’t always doing great. In fact, there were times when he 
even struggled to make enough money for him and his wife to eat. T o make money, he started building 
out funnels and even came to our second Funnel Hacking Live event. He was so broke he didn’t even 
have the money to get a hotel room for the last night of the event, so he stayed up all night in the hotel 
lobby making funnels.
When he came to the event, he thought to himself, “I will do everything Russell says, except I will not 
publish. I refuse to do that, because I’m selling products and services. I don’t want to put things out 
there in the world. But I’ll do anything else Russell says. ” 
In my very first presentation, I stood up on stage and told everyone, “Y ou have to start publishing 
consistently, all the time. That’s how you build a relationship with your audience and that’s how you 
increase the value of that relationship. Y ou have to be publishing stuff every single day. ”
When Steve went home after the event, he was still reluctant to publish, but he did it because I told 
him it was important. He started a podcast, and that podcast has fueled his entire business for the last 
three or four years since then. T ruly, publishing was the key!

3 Types of Content. Some of you are probably thinking, “But, Russell, I don’t want to do a podcast. ” 
I get it. Some things in business are enjoyable, some are doable, and some make you want to pull your 
hair out with frustration. 
So instead of telling you that you have to publish by writing, or you have to publish by talking, or you 
have to publish by making videos, I’m going to teach you three ways to quickly publish your content 
every single day, and you can choose your favorite way to publish. At the end, I’ll even share with you 
one sweet trick that will let you publish all three methods while only doing the work for one! 
Do you like to write? If so, you should choose blog posts as your publishing method. The easiest way 
to do a blog is to go to medium.com and create a free account. Y ou could write blog posts on your own 
site, but your site probably doesn’t have the amount of readers that Medium has. This way, you don’t 
even have to create a blogging website. When someone comes into your lead funnel and opts in, you 
can send them to your blog on your thank you page. Then, they can start reading your blog posts and 
learning what you stand for. 
Now if you’re saying to yourself, “I would rather die than write, ” then perhaps audio is a better fit for 
you. Some of you can write a book in like a week and a half, but for me, it takes at least a year to write 
a book; even then, that entire process is full of so much pain. Writing is hard for me, but audio is super 
easy, and that’s why I chose podcasting as my publishing method. 
For the first five years, my podcast was called “Marketing in Y our Car. ” I knew that if I had a big, fancy 
studio with all the audio stuff, I would never actually do it. Instead, every morning that I drove to the 
office, I would just get out my iPhone, press record, and talk.
After five years, I changed its name to the “Marketing Secrets” podcast, and do you want to guess how I 
record that one? The exact same way: I click record and talk while I’m driving to the office. Y ou can hear 
the engine in the background, and all sorts of other noises, but it doesn’t matter because I’m sharing 
my best stuff with my people. That’s how you connect with your audience. They don’t care if you have 
studio-quality sound or picture. They care that you’re vulnerable, you share your experiences, and you 
share your knowledge. 
Now, if you don’t like to write, and you don’t like to talk, I sure hope you like making videos! If not, 
choose one of the options above that feels the least like getting your teeth pulled. But if you love being 
on video, the best publishing method for you is to start a vlog. Depending on your audience, you might 
want to host it on Y ouT ube, Facebook, or Instagram. The site doesn’t matter that much. What matters 
most is that you consistently publish something every single day, and then you let your list know where 
to find your videos at. 
Create 3 Types of Content in 1 Fell Swoop. Hopefully, you’ve honed in to one publishing method 
that will work for you. And honestly, that’s all you need to do. But if you want to really hit it out of the 
park, my suggestion is to follow my one sweet trick where you can do the work of only one publishing 
method, but end up publishing to all three methods with minimal effort! 
T o do this, you’ll want to choose video as your publishing method. Think of a topic, hold up your phone, 
and record yourself talking. Usually that’s where you’d stop if you were just doing video, right? But in 
this situation, you’re going to do a few quick steps to turn that same content into two more publishing 


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   34
methods. First, download the audio and upload it to your podcast. Second, get the audio transcribed at 
temi.com for $.10/minute and upload the transcription onto your blog on Medium. Boom! Y ou’ve now 
published in all three places while only doing the actual work of one!
Start Publishing Today. If you’re just starting out and you don’t have a list yet, today is the time to 
start publishing. If you’ve already got a small list, today is the time to start publishing. And if you’ve got 
a gigantic list, today is the time to start publishing. 
Did you see the common thread with all of those statements? If you don’t start publishing today, you’re 
delaying your success, and you might never even start. Y ou’ll make excuses like, “I have to wait until 
(your lead magnet) is finished or until (your sales page) is perfect. ” I have news for you: your business 
will never be completely finished, and it will never be completely perfect. Y ou need to get your stuff to 
80% done, and then go! Repeat after me: Done is better than perfect!
Imagine if you started building your list, and you told them, “I’m going to come out with a product in a 
couple of months from now. It’s going to be amazing. ” If you don’t continue to nurture that list, they’re 
going to forget about who you are. Then, when your product comes out and you launch it, nobody will 
buy it. Y ou would have wasted all your time and energy into building your list because you didn’t build a 
relationship with your people. It’s a two-step process: build a list, then build the relationship. 
Document the Journey. Why are we so captivated by before and after photos, whether it’s in the 
weight loss industry or in the house flipping business? Because they show us the journey someone 
went through! They show us how difficult the transformation must have been. 
If we just joined the journey when they had lost the weight, or when the house was renovated, we 
wouldn’t really “get it. ” Where were the trials they went through? What happened along the way? Where 
was the heartache, the sorrow, the triumphs, and the joy? 
Some of you are thinking, “Russell, I can’t publish because I haven’t met my goal yet. When I lose 
100 pounds, though, that’s when I’ll start publishing about my weight loss journey. ” Or maybe you’re 
thinking, “When I make $100 million, then I’ll start talking about my business journey. ” 
If you waited until you met your goal, do you know how much of a disservice you would be doing for 


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   35
your audience? They are likely starting toward the beginning of their journey as well, and they need a 
leader to help them get to the next step. 
Let me be real clear: you don’t have to meet your end goal in order to help someone; you just have to 
be one or two steps in front of them. If you’re one step in front of them, and they start getting to know 
you through your blog, podcast, or vlogs, people will want to follow you. It’s natural. 
Jay Abraham said that people are silently begging to be led. They’re walking around with the umbilical 
cord on their belly button, trying to find someone to plug into. They’ll either plug in to you, or they’ll find 
someone else to plug into. This is your opportunity. 
Y our audience need to know that someone actually gets them and understands their struggles and 
frustrations. It’s pretty difficult to really remember what life felt like several years ago, but it’s pretty 
easy to remember what life felt like a few months ago. The pain is still raw, the wounds are still fresh, 
and that is one of your greatest assets right now. Y ou know how it feels to be in your audience’s shoes, 
because the pain and the triumphs are so recent. 
If I felt qualified to start teaching marketing, guess what? I probably wouldn’t have started teaching 
marketing yet. When I started my podcast, I didn’t feel qualified. It’s insane to me that all these people 
trust me, because I’m just figuring this out on my own. I didn’t go to school for this. I don’t have an MBA 
or a doctorate or even a regular degree in marketing. I’m just obsessed with it. 
What’s interesting is that the more I started publishing, the better I got. Steve Larsen even told me one 
time, “I started listening to your ‘Marketing in Y our Car’ podcast, and, for the first 45 episodes or so, it 
wasn’t very good. But around episode 45-46, it started getting good, and now it’s on fire. ” 
Most people will start publishing, and put out three to four blog posts, or podcasts, or vlogs, and give 
up. Maybe they don’t see the traffic coming in, or the R.O.I., or they feel like they’re not doing a great 
job. Thankfully, I didn’t even know how to check my stats for like four years. For four years, I had no way 
to know if anyone was even listening. I just kept publishing and never quit. Finally, after four years, we 
figured out how to track our stats. That’s when we realized we did have a following; but we didn’t for 
the first three years.
So regardless of where you’re at on your journey, start publishing today. People will plug in to you at 
different points of your journey, and along the way, you’ll build your relationship with your list and really 
be able to serve your audience in the most amazing ways possible.
Testing Y our Material. By publishing today, not only can you 
help people along the way who are just a step or two behind 
you on your journey, but you can also test out your material. 
Think of your favorite comedian for a minute. Y ou’ve seen them 
perform on stage or on TV, and you probably laugh so hard you 
could cry because something in their message resonates with 
you. They get you. Do you think they were always hilarious, 
though? Most likely, they spent years refining their material. 
They probably told thousands of jokes in their lifetime to 
everyone they met. The more they told them, the more they 
perfected the joke, the delivery, and the timing. And then, every 
now and then, their joke would make their audience laugh. 


LEAD FUNNELS SWIPE FILE  |   36
Then, they performed those jokes at local comedy shows or dive bars, continually perfecting their 
message, until finally they booked comedy shows nationwide. For many years, they did what I’m asking 
you to do: they tested out their material. Just as they’ve perfected their message, you need to ensure 
your message resonates with your audience as well.
Can you imagine how good of a story teller you’ll be if you write, talk, or vlog every day for a year? I bet 
you’ll learn real quick which stories and messages resonate with your audience through the comments 
and emails you’ll receive. That feedback should guide you on which products and services you should 
sell. Let your audience tell you what they need and want. Similarly, you’ll realize that when you’re not 
getting much feedback from some of your content, you still need to work on the message, the timing, 
and the delivery.
Sometimes we hit it right out of the ballpark with one of our podcasts, and then I’ll create an entire lead 
funnel around one episode. Y ou can do that, too, by giving away your best episode as your lead magnet 
by saying, “If you’d like to get my number one episode ever downloaded on iT unes where I share (your 
hook), put in your email address. ” After they opt in, they can listen to that episode immediately on your 
thank you page, and then you can suggest they subscribe to your podcast to stay connected.  
Finding Hooks. As you tell your stories over and over, finding out which ones resonate with your 
audience, you can also test out different curiosity hooks. Y our audience is giving you data every day you 
publish; you just have to be aware of it. Which headlines give you more readers? Which phrases give 
you more listeners? Which messages give you more viewers? 
As you test out different headlines, you can track which content gets more traffic. When you’ve found 
a few winners, you have great material to use in your ads because you’ll know which hooks grab your 
audience and draw them in to you. By publishing every day, you’ll build the relationship with your list 
and be able to really help them.
Some people think they can start or grow their business without first doing the foundational work 
explained in this book. When things inevitably don’t work out, and they come to me super frustrated 
that they’re not getting any opt ins, I say to them, “Well, have you done everything I told you to do in this 
book? Have you published every day? What are the hooks that worked for your audience in the past? 
What material have you tried? What do they listen to? What do they like?” 
They haven’t done the work, though, so they have no clue what resonates with their audience. Not 
putting in the work, yet expecting the reward, is like watching a race from the finish line and then 
holding out your hand for a medal. Remember this: rewards only come to those who put in the work. 
So whether you’re just starting out or whether you’ve got a massive following already, follow the five 
steps inside of this book to create your lead funnel. Don’t wait until your product is ready; don’t wait 
until everything is perfect. Start today, because once you start, you’ll begin growing the relationship 
with your list, and as we all know… the money is in the list!
