## Transcript
What's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson and welcome to the Marketing Secrets podcast. Today I want to share with you a message about the fact that I finally, I think, understand how some of you guys feel. I've been publishing for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time, right? I started my internet marketing business probably 15-some odd years ago now and at the time I have published a bajillion podcasts and videos and tell seminars and webinars and summits and events and all sorts of stuff, right? And so for me, I think I lost my empathy for people who struggle when it's like publishing stuff. I'm like, just do it! Just go out there! Just do it! Just push the record and talk! I forgot what it's like to go through the vulnerability and the fear and the stress and all the things that come with putting your message out there. And what's been fun, as some of you guys know, recently I launched another podcast and it's something different I've ever done before. It's not related to marketing or sales or business or anything like that. It's related to my religion, to my faith, to my beliefs. It's funny because I was like, this is going to be really fun and really easy. I'm just going to go and click record and start talking, right? I started to do it and it was way different. So the podcast is those who don't know it. It's the Book of MormonChallenge.com and so I recorded the first two episodes, man, probably nine or so months ago and then they sat there because I was too nervous to put them out there and I was like, why am I so nervous about this? I was so nervous it took me almost three weeks to publish it and then last night, finally, I was like, I was out Sunday so I had good spiritual experience all day and I was like, okay, I'm in the zone. I'm going to do it. And then I started recording at about 11.15 at night. I was 47 minutes into the recording and I was just like, I don't like this. I hate every word I've said. I don't like how I said it. I don't like all these things. And so I stopped it and deleted it. I need to redo it because I feel like now I understand the stories better and I did. So I clicked record again. I spent another hour, over an hour recording the next podcast episode and then I sent it to my brother to go and edit and get it all ready to go live. And then like all morning long, I'm in second guessing, like, oh, maybe I should do it again. I told that story wrong. I didn't really have all these things, right? And like, oh, at the ending, when I did this, I don't like how I did it. And like, and then also this morning, I was like, I bet you this is how other people feel. Like maybe the reason why I'm doing this exercise, amongst other reasons was to get empathy for the people I'm working with. When you're nervous, you're scared about publishing. But I get it now. I get the fear and the nervousness that goes behind putting yourself out there, especially with something you love and you believe about and you care about and you want other people to listen. And you really honestly want to serve people, right? I guess my message for you guys today is, is kind of twofold. Number one, I have empathy for you. I understand the fear of putting yourself out there. And number two, I'm publishing that episode today, even though I wanted to like, I want to add in tweak and change. And no, I'm just gonna put it out there because good enough is good enough, right? A lot of us never get started because we're so nervous about it not being good enough. And the problem with that is then we never get started. And the goal of what we do as authors and speakers, as coaches, as experts, is whatever you want to call yourself, somebody's trying to change the world in your own little way is to get things out there. And one thing I know for sure is that by not posting it, not putting it out there, it's not going to change anyone's life. That's the one thing I'm positive of. It's important to get it out there because that's the only way you can actually touch and affect and help and serve somebody else. And that's the whole reason behind what we do and why we do what we do, right? Hopefully this gives you encouragement to know that even Russell gets scared sometimes. And even Russell second guesses himself and gets nervous. But when it all comes down to it, you just got to click publish, just put it out there. So hopefully that gives some inspiration to somebody out there who's nervous today. Hopefully it gives you the permission to do it. So there you go. You know how permission to do it. Just go and do it. Just click record on the podcast or on the video or on the blog, click post or whatever the thing is that you're doing to publish your message. Just go out there and just push it. Just push the button. No matter how imperfect it seems, no matter how many flaws you see, you know, how many things you know you could have done better, no matter whatever that is, it's just time to put it out there and just let the world have what you got. I'm on podcast episode now probably, I don't know, five or six hundred. I have no idea. And I've probably shared the same message multiple times over the last five or six years as I've done this. And hopefully this time gets better. It's okay to republish the same thing later with your new lens of understanding and what you've gained in the process of growing and learning. Today's the day. Go click publish. Make it go live. Even if you're scared to death, even if you hate it, even if whatever, just push it live. All right guys, thanks so much for everything. Hitting them for the day today. It's going to be an amazing day. Appreciate you all and we'll talk to you soon. Bye everybody.
