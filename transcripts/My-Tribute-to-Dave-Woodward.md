## Transcript
Dave wasn't a good man. Like Dave was one of the best ever. Dave was always trying to figure out how do I become better, a better version of myself. Always pushing and striving to become better. Most of you guys wouldn't be listening to this. You wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be part of this community. You wouldn't be successful on leadership. It wasn't with the back of Dave's sacrifice so much. Dave, if you're listening, I love you. This is your chance. I want people to know how amazing you are because I know it. I know your wife knows it. Your kids know it, but the world needs to know it. Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson. And today I am recording a special podcast. And this is one I've been really nervous to record and talk about. But today I wanted to do a podcast talking about, about Dave Woodward, one of my closest friends ever. The CEO of ClickFunnels, someone who, if you follow me or follow any of the, you know, any of the ClickFunnels family, you know, that he passed away. And that's the podcast about, I want to talk about Dave in a very happy, fun, exciting way. Tell stories about him and his life. I've been trying to like think through this and write out notes and a million different things. And as I keep trying to do that, realizing he's just delaying me from, from just doing this. And so I'm just going to jump into it without notes, which is kind of an outline of my head of where I want to go. And a couple of things. I had a chance to speak at his funeral, which was just a really special experience, a moment for me. And I got permission from his family to be able to share that with you guys. And so I'm playing that probably towards the end here. And I want to start with actually a post I made on December 6th. So December 6th that morning, obviously we've known it's been 18 months that we found out that Dave had the tumor. And he's been fighting this battle. And there were times of like, you know, high highs where we feel like we, you know, we conquered the world in times where it was tough and back and forth and back and forth. And it's weird though, because like, I don't know, Dave's invincible. And I always thought for sure there was no way he wasn't going to win. For those of you guys who are, yeah, I had this crazy trial that happened six weeks ago today. And I ended up having a brain tumor and crazy stuff and a cancer. And so I'm staying here to take care of the cancer and the radiation, all that stuff. And it's crazy though, you know, the last month or so as we got closer, I always went from Dave, always talking about like my goals to get back on top and be better than was before. I'm going to, you know, Dave is core, always shooting for the stars and working towards it and trying to figure out how to get there. And about a month left, he starts seeing things change. And it was interesting, his messaging shift and transition from like, I'm going to try to do the thing to like, it's okay. Like, I'm getting things ready and talking about like, you know, the afterlife and death and you could tell that he'd gotten a spot where he accepted it. It was interesting to watch that transition and it also gave me some pieces as it got towards December 6th. In fact, we had one very scary moment that ended up being for me, probably the biggest blessing in the matter. I was at wrestling practice and I got out of wrestling practice. This is probably a week prior. And on my phone, there's a text from Dave's family saying basically like, hey, he just woke up. He told us he's an hour to live. And if you want to say you're fine on the bike, like now's the time. And I kind of know how to, how do you react to something like that? Like, I'm in rough, you get a resting practice. I'm racing home, drunk in the showers trying to get clean. And, and it was just one of the most beautiful, beautiful moments. Like everyone who was in the room, he had a chance to go and give them some closure. And during that time, he'd been struggling to speak and struggling to, you know, and it was crazy because during the time he was able to look at each person and say something so profound and so important for them to hear. I think, oh, I was hoping this wasn't going to get emotional for me. But anyway, one of the things he told me is he grabbed me closely and looked me in the eyes and said, you changed my life. And then, you know, typical Dave humor, he's just like, all right, we're going to heaven. Love you guys. We'll see you. You know, and he lay down and he kind of fell back asleep and all of us are looking at him and watching, you know, his chest breathe and words like, he's going to stop right now. It was going to happen. It was just like so much, so much fear, so much, you know, we sat there for probably 30 minutes or so. And then the family decided they want to have a prayer and the most beautiful prayers I've ever heard in my life basically say, it's okay. And like, you know, so grateful for time with our father. And, you know, if you're ready for him to have you back, like, we're okay with that now too. And the prayer got done and we all sat there and I think part of us under the prayer is going to pass away and then looked over afterwards. We were still breathing and then typical, typical Dave sees little finger starts, starts moving and he's like, I'm still here. But I think it's all frustrated. Ah, this is a hard one. I thought it was going to be, I want to go back to our room. We get up and we walk him to his room and for me, it was just such like, um, I feel like it's going to be okay. And so anyway, December 6th, when I got the message in the morning that he passed, it was just like, you know, we had that day of crazy thing. We're filming all the stuff and everything was supposed to be happening. It was just everything stopped and I don't know what to do. And I was just like, I just need to go home and write something. I don't know what I need to write. I just need to go home and write something. So I remember going home and I sat there on Facebook trying to make a post and it took me two or three hours to kind of. To know what you want to say. I don't know if it was the right thing to say, but I want to read what I said and hopefully it'll be helpful for some of you guys. If you study the hero's journey, there are seven character archetypes. One of those archetypes is the ally. The ally is the character who assists the hero in their adventure because any adventure worth pursuing is too difficult for one person to overcome alone. Frodo had Sam Wise Gamgee, Joseph Smith had Hiram and I had Dave Woodward. Dave entered my life at the very beginning of my entrepreneurial journey. Looking back now, I know that he was a gift from God to be beside me as I tried to climb an impossible mountain. Over the years, we've shared the highest highs. All the crazy click funnel stories over the year have all involved Dave, but also the lowest lows. There are many nights at two or three o'clock in the morning, long after everyone else has gone home and gone to bed, that Dave and I were still at the office fighting battles for a cause that we believed in. I remember one particularly stressful night around Christmas time during one of our super late night early morning work sessions, telling him that if I had to go to war and I could only pick one person to go with me, it would be you, Dave. This morning, Dave passed away after a 18 month long battle with cancer. 18 months ago, I walked into his office just minutes after he'd found out about the tumor and this giant of a man was on his knees talking to his heavenly father. He told us that if this cancer brings more people closer to Christ, then I will do it. I had a chance to walk with him during his journey and hear stories about dreams and visions he had about Christ and him spending time with others who had passed on before him. In his family's post today, they said that one of the last things he did was open his eyes and said, It really is forever. It's a party on their side and I have work to do. I'd no doubt that he had a chance to see a glimpse of eternity and if nothing else, came back one last time to help strengthen our faith and our savior Jesus Christ and our ability to be together as families again someday. Dave is the greatest example I've ever known. He has an amazing wife who loves him. He has great kids who adore him. He built a company that's changed lives of millions of people around the world and he passed away true to his faith. He won. What more could you want in life? And now because of Dave, we all have a standard to live up to. I want to see him again. I want to be with him again. I want to be like him. I'm committed to growing closer to Christ because of Dave. It really is forever through him. Jesus Christ, we can be together forever someday. I started this post by saying that Dave was my ally, but as I'm finishing it, I'm realizing that the whole time he has been my guide. You know, David, I used to talk about the hero's journey all the time and it's interesting because, you know, in my mind, like I'm the hero and I'm doing the same and going on this conquest, but everyone's journey there, the hero, right? But it's interesting in your own journey, you're the hero. You're trying to to conquer this insurmountable path, but other people's journey, you're their ally or their guide or their, you know, sometimes you're the person that fighting against them and it's just interesting. And, um, and so as I was thinking about the archetypes, like, yeah, Dave was the ally who's there every single time every war I went into, he was there sitting next to me, every hard conversation, everything that was struggling. He was there every single time, but also same time, like he, many aspects was the guy that he was taking me where I was in church ago, like helping me to become who I needed to be, helping me to remember God and Christ where a lot of times for me, I would get so caught up in, in other things. I would forget about that. You know, Dave so many times was like, Hey, this clip for all things, like it's not just a company, there's something bigger, something more important, something we're doing here, something special, something spiritual. And, uh, him and I both believe at our core and our souls, why we spent so much time and energy doing these things. And so I just want to kind of share some more Dave stories. Um, I'm not going to share the story, how we met cause we talked about that at the funeral, so I'll share that at the end of this. I remember one of the first things that happened. We, um, I had done a promotion way back and they called the online market of the year, we got like 30 or 40. Guru's experts to interview us back the first time I interviewed Dan Kennedy, Bill Glazer and all these people to be part of this thing. And I remember we got it done. Dave Hall, this is awesome. I went to his well. And so he took the concept and he licensed it. He did like the online network marketer of the year and he did a couple of the ones by the time I remember, I think MTV Cribs was like the big thing at the time and Dave's like, I want to make MTV Cribs, but for internet marketers. And so he started this brand and this company called legendary marketers. Hi, my name is Dave Woodward. I'm the host of legendary marketers. You've probably seen me as I've been flying around the country, filming some of the world's greatest internet marketers. And he got into a plane and he flew to all these people's houses. And I remember him fly to my house and show up the camera crew and they're filming us and interviewed me. I don't even remember where I sat. I'm sure I thought I was pretty cool at the time and he'll be back now. This is dorky little kid. And again, for somebody that felt so connected to him, I wanted to do things. I kept trying to pull him into some of my crazy schemes and ideas off time. I remember I bought body evolution.com and the trademark and I wanted to start a weight loss company. I'm so excited about this. And so initially we found some people from who were on the, who had been on the biggest loser who I really enjoyed and connected with. And we wanted them to be the faces of the company and, but I need to help running. And so I asked Dave if he'd be interested. So he came in and he was helping me run this company. And it's funny because these, these people, they're such great people, but they'd gained a lot of weight since the show is over. And so every time we meet with them like, okay, you have to lose weight again because you're the faces of this fitness company. I don't know where we're going to do it. They come back three months later to fly back out and they hadn't lost any weight. And I'm like, what do we do? And they've had the frame conversation. Like, Hey, it's the deal. You guys like your heads of weight loss company, you have to lose weight or we have to cut you. And I'm like, how do you say that? But you would always have the hard conversations. I was too scared to have like, again, as my ally, like, okay, Russell's too scared to have this. I'll have a brutal conversation. You know, but all these little companies never, they never took off. I think he was waiting. Like what's something that's going to take off? I can be part of bigger. And then when click funnels came about, I remember Dave's like, I want to be part of this. How do we part of what you're doing? I'm like, like, what do you mean? It's like, I want to be part of this. Like, like, well, I don't like, do you want a job? Like, I'm like, yeah, I know you make really good. Like, I can't afford to pay you like a good salary right now. And he's like, I don't care. I just want to be, I want to be part of this. My name's Dave Woodward. I'm from Marietta, California. And I've had the opportunity of knowing Russell for about the last eight years. It's been a crazy ride. Best decision I've ever made is spending time with Russell and getting to know him better and following all of his marketing stuff. Dave had a great gig at the time. He's making insane amounts of money to do in this real estate coaching, all sorts of stuff. And I was like, I can't replace what you're making now. I was like, I don't care. You're still in California. You'd work remote during the time and we paid him whatever we're able to. And he was just going there and figuring out how to serve and how to grow things. And within a very short period of time, right, we needed to figure out a way to make him more of a partner. And so we brought him in and gave him equity in the company. You know, he would come fly out, you know, once a month, the boys to be part of like the energy and excitement and be part of it. He fly back home and you can tell him so anxiously, you want to be, you want to be in the heat of it all the time. And so he would fly back and forth and eventually after eight months or so, I think, if it was like, I need to move to Boyce, I got to be there. This is the way everything's happening. I got to be part of it. And we'd be in the middle of the area. Proximity is power. I got to be in the middle of it. And so he got his family. They, they uprooted and they moved here to Boyce to be part of it, to be in the middle of all of it. Right. And then we were together every day for, man, 65 or 60 years. Like anytime I'd go to any trip, he was there. He wanted to be there around the energy, around this stuff, like everywhere that things are happening. Uh, years ago, I wrote Docum Seekers book. I swear I would never write a book again. Like I refuse. I'll never write a book again. Like it's the worst thing in the world. And he always wanted me to like, he's like, this is so good. Like people need this. And like, he was so passionate about my work, which was like, how often do you have someone who's like your biggest fan, like your biggest cheerleader, so passionate about what you're doing? Right. Yeah. I remember we went to the genius network and we were sharing a room back the time this click phone still hadn't grown to the point where we felt comfortable getting two rooms. Remember that night I got invited to this dinner thing. So I went to this dinner and Dean Grasios, who I didn't know very well yet were sitting across from me. We're talking and somewhere in the conversation, I remember we're talking about some were thinking like, I need to write a book called expert secrets. And like this was going to be about, and we're getting back to our room. I was like, Hey, um, when I was talking to Dean today, I had, I had a vision. It's like, what was it? I'm like, I got to write a book. It's called expert secrets. And he's like, Oh, freak. I got chills. Like this is the great like, you know, just, he was so excited. He was like, all right, what do I do to make this happen? He's like, I got to move heaven and earth. I got to block everyone. Like you need to be focusing. This is the most important thing you possibly do. And he was like this blocker and protector and making sure I had the time I needed to be able to, to create this thing and to do this thing. My dad was that way with wrestling. Like, like he protected me to make sure that I can focus on the thing that was most important, like the calling, the mission, the thing we were trying to do. And Dave was the only other person that ever done that for me. He was just blocking everything to make sure that I can do what I need to do every single day, despite the fact he had a million things on his shoulder to come in every single day, not once in a while. Every day, like what can I take off your shoulders? And what can I get to take off your plate? It's just one of the magical, the magical things about Dave. I remember he always wanted to learn like he wasn't the most and I could say this to his face. He wasn't the most talented. Most things like as I was writing the expert secrets book and talking about story, he loved these one come a better story to become better. So you, you do these Facebook lives at first. We used to tell a story and then he's like, I get in work. I wasn't good like, what was wrong? I'm like, Dave, you have to tell people not just the facts, but you have to tell about how you feel. He's like, what do you mean? Like you have to open up and like you have to, when you're telling a story, tell the feelings behind the story. And that was so hard for him. He's like, I have to learn, I have to learn. So he would try so hard like open up and like, and like get to the feelings of things, right? He'd get better and better. He'd be so proud of himself. Love you all so much. I hope you guys are having an amazing time. Thank you so much for all that you guys say and do to help me personally. We love you guys. Have an amazing day and we'll talk to you guys soon. See you. Thanks for watching my Facebook live. I'm like, of course I did. He's like, how's that? I'm like, dude, it was way better. Like the way you told your story, how you felt about this, like those are things that people need in story. You want to become better and better at it, right? He coached me and so coach will try to learn it. When he eventually came CEO, he's like, I've never been a CEO before. I don't know how to be CEO. So we found people who are great CEOs and hired them and paid them for coaching. And like, he figured what we wanted to do and then didn't have the skills that do it. So when he got the skill set, most of you are like, oh, I don't know how to do this or I'm not qualified or they just do a crappy job or Dave never did that. It was like, let me figure out how to become the best at this thing. I've learned that the most important thing is focus on the people. As you focus on the people, it all comes back. You know, I look at a world of people where 99.9% of the people in the world are just content and lazy and just the hour they are where Dave was always trying to figure out how do I become better, a better version of myself? Like I want to grow, I want to become better. I want to become the best at this thing. Even till like a month before, before his passing, like it was like my goal is to come back and be better than I was before. He's smarter. I want to be, I want to be able to retain these things like he's always pushing and striving to become better. Um, and that's what made Dave great in so many aspects. It's what, um, what I think everyone loved about him so much, um, which is his excitement. And so he was there serving other people and trying to grow so he could serve people more, not out of the selfish thing. And that's the way a lot of people, they, they serve selfishly. Like I'm doing this, I'm trying to get something. Dave wasn't trying to get something. He just knew there was something bigger. Uh, and for him, it all tied back to God, tied back to Christ, tied back to the things that mattered the most. Um, he loved having his family involved. I've seen his wife build funnels and launch programs, watching his kids do the same thing. Like it was, the things were never about him. It was always about the people that he was the round starting with his family and then with the community and with other people. Um, you know, after the whole cancer started happening, I think again, it was one of the things that in fact, I remember, like I was sitting in this room right there is where the office right there is where I first saw it. I went in there and he was, you know, head down praying as soon as he found out. Next day we sat right here. Uh, seeing this chair, you're sitting right here is we're talking about and he was so scared. You want to go in and he was like, he's like, I want to be here for the library that we're building right here. Like all these visions, all the same we're talking like he's like, we're building towards, I want to see click phones to point. I want to see all these things. I remember how, how scared he was. And then the thing he said, he said it so many times throughout the years. It's like, if me going through this will bring more people to Christ, then I'm willing to do it. Like, I don't know if I could have said that. I don't know if I, you know what I mean? Like you have a Dave saying, I'm willing to take on this pain. Like in the company here, Russell, I'm willing to take on this pain so you can do your mission so you can write your books. You can get it out there. I'm willing to take on this pain. I'm going to take things off your plan. I'm going to stay late so that you can do what you're supposed to do. I'm willing to take on this pain and suffering of going through cancer and these horrible things and losing, um, these things because if it helps you to be able to do what you're doing, I'm willing to take on that pain for you. Like that's such a rare characteristic in a human, right? Like talk about it at the, at the funeral. Like Dave wasn't a good man. Like Dave was one of the best ever, um, was ever been on this planet, ever walked to this earth. Um, and I know that because I saw it every single day, day in and day out, day in and day out. I saw him as he lifted the burden off my shoulders and took it upon his shoulders so that I could do what he thought was, um, was important. I remember one last story and then we'll, we'll, I'll share it. He has my presentation in this funeral, but you know, I was, I had a goal. I wanted to be on New York times best seller and that's like, that was a goal. And, um, I did him a doc.com secrets. Extra secrets. I didn't really try because I was so bitter about it and traffic secret wasn't planning on trying and he's like, no, he's like, you earn this. You deserve this. Like you're better than the other half of you. Like you were going to get it or no matter like whatever it takes. And he wanted that more than I wanted it. Um, so much so that I tried multiple times to give up and to stop trying because it's not easy. Like, Diff, keys are wondering, he knew your time is less. It's not an easy process. First off, you got to write a really good book and then you have to market it really, really well and not in a traditional sense. Like, you know, we sold 80,000 copies in a week, but it didn't hit the New York times list because you can't sell 8,000 copies a week through a funnel. You have to do it a whole bunch of other things. So for me to do, I had to get on TV and radio and interviews and all sorts of like just, it was insanity. Um, and it was expensive and it was hard. And it was like, I wanted about so many times. He's like, no, we're going to get this. You have to get this. Like you earn this. Like you, you are going to be in New York times best seller. I'm like, ah, I kept trying, kept trying and missed the first week and the second week and the third week point was like, I was, I was beyond giving up. And he's like, no, and after I think of the fourth week is when we hit the lesson. And he gave me celebrated me. It's like, dude, like we should celebrate in you Dave. You're the one that made it possible. You don't want to celebrate himself. He won't talk about himself ever. You want to talk about everybody else. He wanted to be the one of the allies supporting, serving, giving and then giving the credit to other people. He'd be so annoyed that I'd talk about him this much right now. But Dave, if you're listening, I love you. This is your chance. I want people to know how amazing you are because I know it. I know your wife knows that your kids know it. But the world needs to know it because I've been the opportunity to be around greatness every single day. And even if people didn't see it, they felt it. I had a handicap sister who passed away and the first person, you know, super, super close to me to pass away. And it's interesting because you look at someone whose handicap is like, there's this burden and this, you know, and after she passed away, like I had the realization I was like, I had a perfect celestial person living with someone who was, who had never sinned, who had never made a mistake, who was flawless, like literally an angel sitting in my house, ever seen in my life. I had a chance to grow up and have her sitting there every single day. Like how lucky was I to see someone who, who was as perfect as you can be in this planet. And yes, she was handicapped, she mentally handicapped, physically handicapped, but she was a perfect human being, right? It was with me every single day. And you take it for granted when they leave, you're like, I miss that spirit. I miss that feeling of just like perfection sitting here. And I think it's the same thing now with Dave not here. Like, man, like I missed that. Like being around greatness every day, being around someone who can in the middle of like the hardest times, like times where it's just like would crush any normal human walking on the smile on his face. Like, who I remember we come in here and we talk after work and he would talk about all the things he's been working on all things. And I just get so wrong. Like, how are we going to do this? Like, I can't handle this weight anymore. He just smiles like, we'll get it. We'll get it was keep moving forward. We're going to get it. And I think that those are times I would have broken under the pressure and under the stress and because of him, I was able to keep going because he had faith and just like, no, like this isn't us, Russell. This is from God. This is something bigger than I can tell you, there is nothing. There's nothing been better in my life than having the opportunity of being involved in helping change other people. I love the passion that exists when you go out and you do everything you possibly can to have an impact in the lives of other people because as it goes from one life, it goes to the next life and to the next life and to next. All of a sudden what you've started doing, it may have been real small. All of a sudden it begins to grow and then as it continues to grow, the impact that it has on people changes everything. He's had perfect optimism every single time. Like, no, like we're going to do this. I mean, there's, there's the legal pressures. There's the title pressures. Like you have no idea thing after thing after thing after thing after thing where I just wanted to walk away so many times and it was Dave Korean saying, no, this is not your mission, Russell, or my mission. This is God's mission. What we're doing is bigger than just a funnel or changing people's lives in so many areas and so many aspects. You cannot stop. You have to keep going. We'll get this. I'm here for you. What can I take off your plate? What can I take off your plate? And he literally, you know, come look at my burden and take more off pile on his own shoulders so I could keep doing what I supposed to do. And I'm eternally grateful for him. I'm grateful that I bumped into him. I'm grateful for every reason we connected. I'm grateful that he believed in me. I'm grateful he believed me more than I believed in myself. I'm grateful he set up to bat for me over and over and over. And I am grateful when I was drowning, he would pull me out of the water. I couldn't. I struggled to move forward when I couldn't. I lost faith in my own mission, my own self. He was there reminding me who I was and where my calling was. You just want to give more. And as you have that opportunity of giving more, you receive so much from Russell. You just want to give back to him as much as you can. What I would forget about what was important in life, he'd remind me of God and of Christ and why all the stuff we're doing doesn't actually matter. That he was, you know, these are all things we're doing to bring more glory to him. And even him during his darkest time, he's going through suffering and pain and not just a physical suffering. I can't even imagine suffering to tell your wife and your kids if I found a brain tumor and like. My life's going to change and like all these things like all the suffering he had to go through and saying, but it's okay. I will do it if it brings one person closer to him. I was blessed to have him to have greatness around me every single day and I will miss it. So the chance to be reunited with him again Sunday. And I just hope for all of you guys that first off, you can find something like that in your life to have around you. And number two, and probably more importantly is to be that person for somebody else. We can we're all in our own heroes journey at the same time. They're time when you're called to be the ally in someone's journey. Sometimes you're called to be the guy in someone's journey. Sometimes. Oh, and you know, heaven forbid that you get called to be the the the the enemy in someone's don't be that person ever. But I'm just understanding that. Yeah, like all this one a day, but also all this can be a day for somebody else. And so when you do that, like it's crazy. Like we had. Today's funeral. I mean, the chapel was was I think it was for 700 people, 750 people and it was packed. The chapel is complete packed. And then we zoomed on zoom. I mean, there were there were well over 1000 people who watched his funeral live, which is amazing for for a man who who lived his life of service who wasn't the face of it all who wasn't out there. But people knew him because because what he did resonated and changed so many other people's lives. As I was about to click record this morning, there was this talk that popped my head and there's this quote and I don't know why I need to tell you this quote, but I've heard it my head a bunch of times. I think it probably has to do with those who are struggling with this. And I understand it like death is hard. It's scary. And there's always the question of like why and why not? Like we did all the things right. Like Dave was healthy. Dave was falling God. Like why does this have to happen? And anyway, this is the quote that is from a talk. One of my favorite talks actually. It's a guy named Jeffrey R. Holland. And this is a talk when I was on my mission 20 years ago that changed my life. The talk is called a high priest of good things to come. If you want to Google it, you can watch the whole talk. It's it's powerful. It's partially emotional. Trust God and believe and believe in good things to come. And he goes on and say, some blessings come soon. Some blessings come late and some don't come until heaven. Those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they come. And so to kind of end this part before I hand over to the funeral. I was like, I thought just, you know, I think all of us were hoping and praying for a blessing that Dave was going to be healed and be back to normal. It's going to be amazing. I think. Again, I started like Dave was invincible. Of course, he was going to be fine. And when it was, it was hard, but things understand me like it says here, some blessings come soon, some blessings come late. Some don't come until heaven for those who embrace the gospel of Jesus Christ, they come. And that's the message I want to leave with you guys. Again, Dave said if it brings one person closer to Christ, it was worth it. You know, cancer, like it was amazing. People from every faith, every denomination reached out. David told me, he's like, my Muslim friends messaged me. They're praying for me. My Jewish friends were doing it. He's like, I had friends who were agnostic, who were praying just in case I had friends who would ate the astute and believe in God and came back and started. I had friends who had prayed in years to start praying. He's like, this is what's about. I can't thank you all enough for not be listening to this. I think that's been the most bizarre thing for me. During this whole thing is. During this whole thing, I can't believe literally the hundreds of done eating thousands of people who have been so kind. And if you happen to have already known this and you're listening to this, I thank you. It's been a crazy, crazy ride, but I am so thankful for people. And so for all of you guys, like for the day to go through some vein, let this experience bring you closer to your God. Um, fall on your knees, say a prayer. Um, remember him, remember your mission. Remember that we're not just here for us. Here for something bigger. We're here for a mission and you're here to serve other people of missions. And so be the ally in their, in their journey, take the weight off their shoulders and in your journey, pursue it. Even though it's hard. Um, when it gets too heavy, fall on your knees and pray to God, ask him for help. And sometimes when the trials don't go the way that you want them to, then, um, again, remember this quote, some blessings come soon. Some come late and some don't come into heaven. I know I can be frustrating and hard, but, um, there's the, there's a bigger, something bigger than we understand or see, obviously. Thank you guys so much for listening. I know this is a different than traditional podcast, but I hope you got some value from it and got something. Um, I appreciate you all. I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve you as a community. We're grateful for Dave who helped build what we have here. Um, most of you guys wouldn't be listening to this. You wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be part of this community. You wouldn't be successful entrepreneurship was the fact that Dave sacrificed so much, um, for all of us. And I'm grateful for my love and my missing. I can't wait to see him again someday. Again, I was so honored that his family asked me to speak at his funeral. And with their permission, I'm going to play my little session. I think it's 10 or 15 minutes long. Um, kind of tell us a day story. You can let us know how we met. We'll hear stories, um, some of the fun crazy adventures, um, that we had along the way. Thank you so much. And, um, I hope you enjoy the rest of this episode. Um, first off, what an honor to be with you guys and debt. I had a chance to talk about my best friend. Um, Dave wasn't just a good guy. I believe he was one of the best people who's ever been on this planet. Um, I don't mean that lightly. I've had a chance to see the ripple effect of what's been created and happens because of the life he lived. We see it in this room here, but it's felt literally by millions of people around the world. And, um, if Dave heard me say that I would be super annoyed that I was bringing attention to him, um, and so just to make sure, uh, it reminds me of a story. A couple of years ago, he broke his neck and he was in his bed with a big neck cast on and so he was away from the office for like a week or two. And then he came back in and his big neck got cast on a big smile on his face as he's running in and first thing we're in the middle of something. We're always in the middle of something. And he grabbed his phone and he started a Facebook live and start talking to all these people and he's going on talking to his remittance and people are popping in from all around the world and they're seeing Dave with the neck brace on and he's talking and so excited. And the comments are like, what's wrong with your neck? What's going on? And finally he noticed that everybody's so concerned about him. He's like, Oh, I broke my neck. I'm fine. Let's go and kept go for you. Yes. Super neck collar I have on. I had surgery this last week on my neck. Everything's fine. Don't worry about that. And I feel like that's probably how Dave would feel about a lot of this. It's just like, you guys, let's go. Come on. Keep him forward. I'm going to quote some superhero movies twice in this talk. We talked a lot about superheroes meet him. We all wanted to be superheroes. He got a dress up at one. You guys have seen the shield and the cape and everything there than Captain America, but I was putting my thoughts down last night. I kept thinking about the movie Avengers Endgame at the end of the movie. I don't want to spoil it or but Iron Man dies. Bad. But one of the coolest things about that is that Iron Man captured himself on a hologram and he came back after a funeral to talk to his kids and stuff. And there's a quote from that that he said that sound like something Dave would say if he was here. And he said, don't feel bad about this. Part of the journey is the end. As hard as that is, it's it's true for all of us. And and so I wanted to think about Dave's journey specifically the journey I was able to have with him, which was so special for me. And I just want to share a couple of the things that I learned from him. The first thing is that those who know Dave is if he saw something he wanted, he just went and got it. The way I met Dave was kind of similar. We were it was a seminar on California. We were doing in the Institute of McLaren. Do this event and we had a couple of speakers and Stu had this great idea. Like, hey, we could get all the attendees to pay for all of our meals while we're here. And so he put these sign up sheets in the back of the room. And the first thing he said, day number one, the event is, Hey, do you want to go out to eat with the speakers? Go to the back and you can sign up to take him out to lunch or dinner. And I had never met Dave this time. He ran to the back, grabbed my sheet and filled out breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day of the event and sit alone. I had every meal with Dave and that's. That's how I fell in love with Dave again, again, again, again. And really quickly found and he shared so many common things and beliefs. And for some reason, I don't know what we started a friendship and just continue on that line of just like he saw he wanted you want to, he just go for it. We had these crazy conversations. We'd be in a meeting one day. We were on click files. We were we're getting close to like being at 50,000 subscribers. A big number we were all striving towards and we'd hired the Harman Brothers to make this video and like we should do a big launch around the video. So we're brainstorming and again, I'm just throwing dumb ideas against the wall. I'm like, Hey, we should, we should file these influencers here and we could rent out boys to football stadium and play football. And then we got bubble soccer balls and he's like, what if we like set again a spoke world record at the biggest bubble soccer ball game in the history of the world? And I'm just like laughing and laughing and three weeks later, we set the world record for the largest bubble soccer game in the world. The best thing that Dave, I've been around him like he gave me the ability to dream big because I knew whoever we came up with, he would figure out a way to make app. Yeah. He saw something wanted and he figured out how to get it done. In fact, I think if he was here today and he saw this many people in the room and all the people on Zimni be annoyed that we weren't trying to sell something. So with his permission, I'm just kidding. Next thing I knew about Dave is he was always up for anything. It's me as no the crazy things that we did. I remember one day I'd been like planning for like three or four months to do this long water fast. I was only going to drink water for a week and he found out about like Sunday night I was starting Monday and instead of like preparing or asking any questions. He showed up Monday. He's like, I'm doing it with you. I'm like, if you thought through this, like this is not. He's like, no, I'm in and we, he did a five day water fast was zero, like not a 30 seconds notice just started and went with it and did the whole thing. Um, one day he showed up. Um, one of our friends, Eric Hafford, he challenges this thing called the one chip challenge. He brings you this chip in a coffin, one chip in a coffin because it's so bad. Day shows up at our house, like five or six of these things and we sat there and we ate this chip. I remember like it hurts so bad. Mike, like I was dying and he just wanted to beat me. And so like while I'm on the ground crying and like my mouth hurts so bad, my guts and I'm like, he sat there and waited till we all tapped out and gave up and then you like finally at the end one and, um, just all the time one day we were in the middle, it was right before a big event and we were so stressed out and so anxious and then I see him walk out of the office, the biggest, you know, Dave's smile, but this was bigger than normal and, um, walks in the kitchen and they like text me, hey, I also need to meet you in the kitchen. I walk in and they'd set up a pie duel and there was like plastic on the ground. They had pies and we dole. They stood back to back and we walked in and I was like, why are we doing this? Like it's March 14th. It's pie day. We have to have a pie duel. I think of course we do. And I can't oblige. We just did that. We had a pie duel. He was always up for just anything. He made life fun. Even in the most stressful, crazy, um, crazy times. Third thing to learn from him is that he showed up consistently for everybody. I've been sick at home, having a flu and also hear the doorbell ringing and Dave's there with some of the kids and he's got a box of supplements and things and all this stuff and to show up then, um, over and over and over again. When Todd and I were trying to plan click for almost 2.0, I flew out to Atlanta and I was in there. I was there meeting with Todd and Dave found out we were meeting and he jumped into the plane and like few hours later, he's there with us like there to like to be part of it. He always showed up. He was always there to support, to lead, to guide, uh, and to be part of it. Um, and the last thing I want to share is, and this is one's probably the thing that I'm most impressed with, involve things, but Dave was a man of values. And I know that all of us, especially Dave has so many things that we value, right? We value our family, our business, our work, our health, like all the things we, we value. Um, right. Yesterday I was listening to something and Jordan Peterson said something interesting. He said that, um, they always have a hierarchy of values and he says that the thing that you value the most becomes your God. And for most people, it's, it's usually not God. It's something else. But if you look at Dave's life, the thing that he valued the most was God, which is so rare today. Um, and you saw in every part of his life is the way he made decisions. Like I prior to him coming and moving to Idaho and assuming stuff, I pitched him on a million different crazy ideas that were, um, may not have been, you know, just idea after idea and I kept trying to like, you know, the voice he coming out of that we work on these projects together. Um, and it wasn't until we talked about click funnels and he said, I remember him telling me, said, this is something special about this thing. This is being led by God. What we are doing, like this is something bigger. And because he believed in that, then he was willing to go all in to be part of, um, part of this thing. Um, and I watched him grow, um, with us over the years from coming in at one level where he was helping the affiliates to becoming head of business development and becoming a partner and then becoming our CEO and running the entire, uh, the entire operation. Um, his number one value in life was God. And he saw it in all aspects of his life shortly after was Kerry and then the kids, it's just so powerful to see man who, who believes that way and lives that way. And I still remember the day when he was in the office, um, after he got the call they found out he had the tumor. I knew he was on a column and afterwards I looked at him and I couldn't see him. And so I stood up to walk, um, over to see if he was still there. And, um, this giant of a man was on his knees. He could have been running, crying, hiding whatever. And the first thing he did is petition to send me father. And then afterwards told us, we've heard him say so many times today, said if cancer brings more people closer to Christ, then I will do it. He'll submit himself and his will to God's will is why I respect Dave so much. I got closer and closer to the end and, um, he knew things were kind of turning. Um, we had an amazing night. We had a chance to spend and, um, talk to Dave and pray with him. And it was amazing. And then two or three days later I was on a zoom call or something. And also my phone lit up and it was Dave. And I was like, I said he was calling and I was so scared. Cause I don't know if just all the emotions and fears and everything. So I quickly got off my call and I call him back and, um, the boys answered the phone and handed to Dave and he looked at me. He's like, the biggest file in space. He's like, I'm about to take it now. I'm like, okay. He's like, I'm probably not going to wake up. Um, I swear, no, I love you. I'm going to see you in heaven, but not too soon. And I was like, what? And he said, good night. I love you and hung up and I got a snapshot of my photo of that. That last moment and the smile and just knowing that like, and I'm going to see him in heaven again, but not too soon to kind of close. Um, I was thinking about ever since especially the last two or three weeks, like I'm thinking about this and Dave and just everything, a lot of scriptures and going to my head and the scripture I was thinking about today was the principle of the parable of the talents. And for most of you have heard, um, the master came and gave one person, five talents, one person, two talents, one person, one talent and hadn't gone world and see what they would do with it. And Dave was, Dave was the guy that got the five talents. He took these things and he went out there and he, he multiplied him. He came back to the master and what the master, um, told this guy in the scriptures is I'm sure the exact same thing that our savior, Jesus Christ told Dave. We saw him begin last week. So he said, well done now, good and faithful servant. That has been faithful over a few things. I'll make the ruler over many things and are thou into the joy of the Lord. Is this got closer and closer? I kept thinking my head like, I'm not ready. I'm not ready for this. So all you guys felt the same way and that brought me to one more superhero story and then all he done in Dr. Strange. There's a moment in that movie. If you've seen it where Dr. Strange was his mentor and she's about to pass away. She's frozen time, slowed it down as slow as she possibly can. And Dr. Strange says, I'm not ready. The mentor says, there's no one ever is. We don't get to choose our time. Death is what gives life meaning to know your days are numbered. Your time is short. The only reason our lives have meaning is because there's an end. If it wasn't for the end, there would be no purpose in the scripture. The ring in my head as soon as I got the news about Dave is in the book of Corinthians. This one Paul wrote the Corinthians. He was talking to these people about Christ and how he had won the victory over death for them. And the quote that kept I kept hearing my head the moment I heard about Dave passing was this. I give Paul run your Corinthians. He said, Oh death, where's there? Where's the sting? Oh gray, where's that victory? Because of Christ, we know that we will have a chance to be with him again. Be together again, his families, his friends. If I could say one last thing today right now before you receive again heaven would be thank you for being my example, for being my ally, for being my guide and being my friend. Dave, you did it, man. I love you. Can't wait to see you soon. I say things on the image. Jesus Christ, amen.
