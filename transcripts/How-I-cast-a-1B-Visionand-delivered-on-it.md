What's up everybody? This is Russell. Welcome back to the show. Excited to be hanging out with you guys today. And today I want to talk about a topic I haven't talked a lot about with you guys, which is leadership and more so than leadership. Actually, a very specific part of leadership, which is how do you first off, how do you capture a vision? Right. And then number two, after you've captured that vision, how do you actually share that vision with other people, right? To get people to want to follow you, both like customers, but also, um, employees and partners and team members. How do you cast a vision away that gets people to want to come to you? Um, and this is actually a really interesting question. Um, I got it from one of my friends. It was after funnel hacking live. Um, you know, obviously if you guys, you know, if you've been following the click funnels movement for the last decade, like we built a huge business in a brand and every single year we did this big event. And this was the last one, funnel hacking. I've 10 and, uh, it was a little after I got off stage, I got the message from, from, uh, my buddy and he asked me, I said, you know, uh, how do you do that? He said, I want to do that in my business. Like our companies growing things are good. Like I really, I want to figure out how to cast like, first off, how to capture that vision, right? Like, like what is the vision? How do I find what the vision is for my, for my business? And number two is after I have that, how do I, how do I get the right people? So that's what I'm going to talk about today, because as you know, without a vision, the people perish and our job is visually entrepreneurs is to cast that vision. When you cast that vision, your people will come to you. Can you probably heard me, um, you know, uh, talk about this before, but a lot of people are scared. Like I don't want to put my, my, myself out there, my, my vision out there because people are going to make fun of me. And the reality is like, I promise you, people make fun of me more than probably anybody, right? We spent, uh, just on one event last week, we spent a million dollars in ads. My face was everywhere on the whole internet. And guess what? A lot of people don't like seeing my face everywhere all over the internet. And there's like all sorts of people talking trash in the comments and things like that, right? Like when you put yourself out there, there's going to be people who do not like you and they're going to be vocal about it, but your job is not to, to, to speak to everybody, right? Your job is to talk to the people you've been called to serve. Right. Uh, and so when you put your vision out there, the people, people who'd be offended would be annoyed, people who don't care, but when you do it correctly, your people will hear you, right? And they're going to come to you and you're going to have a chance to serve them and change their life. Okay. We are visionary entrepreneurs. We are the dreamers. Uh, one of my favorite quotes is from T.E. Lawrence. He says, all men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their mind, wake in the day to find that it was in vanity, but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men for they must act out their dreams with open eyes to make it possible. Um, I love that quote. It's like a rallying call. We had that on the back of the t-shirts one year, funnel hacking live cause I love it so much. It's kind of funny. Um, I, I, uh, have an aura ring. So I, I sleep every single night. It is funny. My wife and I was T's cause my wife, she sleeps so good every night. Her REM and her deep sleeps like it 25, 30% of mine always is like my REM is like it 3% or 1% or 2% like, uh, and it bothers me because like, she always has these amazing dreams. Right. She tells me these dreams. Like that is so cool. Like I don't know, I don't remember any of my dreams, but then I found this quote. I tease her. I'm like, well, I'm a dreamer of the day. So that's, that's the difference. Like you dream at night, but I dream in the day, but it's such a powerful thing. Right. That's our job as visionary entrepreneurs to be the dreamers of the day. I'm going to read the quote one more time. Cause it's so powerful. I want you to like to rehearse something. I don't want to roll back on the thing. Instead of just going to share with you. Okay. So once again, all men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, waking the day to find that it was in vanity, but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men. They may act out their dreams with open eyes to make it possible. Um, such a powerful thing. Okay. So I'm going to go through this. I've, I've got a bunch of notes here. I'm going to go through. Um, and there's basically three kind of phases I'm going to walk you through. So the first phase, the first step, what do you want to call it? First secret. If you're Russell Brunson, oh, I am a secret number one step number one. Remember what I call it is actually you have to become a leader. And this is an interesting thing because, um, I don't know. Like I've never really taught leadership before. I don't love reading leadership books even. Um, but the reality is that people want to follow a leader. Like you have to be willing to step up and be that leader. And most people in this world do not want to be a leader. They are scared to death of, of, um, of leadership. Right. And, um, it's interesting if you've read the book, Atlas shrugged is one of my favorite books, but there's a scene in the very beginning where, uh, Daphne is on the, you know, she's the head of the railroad. She's on the railroad training, get stuck and you know, this train's been stuck for like 20, 30 minutes. She comes out and she's like, why is it not moving? Like, Oh, the light turned red. And they're like, well, like, how do you fix it? Like, well, I wait for something to fix it. Like, well, is there any issue? Like, no, you could go, but, you know, and the, the, the railroad workers, like, they did not want to take the responsibility on their own shoulders. They refused to do that. Right. And finally she's like, she's like, I'm Daphne Taggart. I'm the president of the road. Like you're going to go. And like, so if you go, you'll take, like, if something goes wrong, it'll be on your shoulders, not ours. Right. She's like, yes. And like, she was willing to step up and like, and take that, right? And then, and, and take the, the responsibility. If something went wrong, like that's what leadership is, right? To be willing to say, I, this is the direction we're going. If it's not right, I will take extreme ownership over the thing. Cause most people will not do that. Okay. They're so scared of getting in trouble or breaking something. They don't want to have the responsibility. Cause they'd rather do nothing. In fact, this is why the whole, I'm not going to get political cause I don't care about politics, but it's, it's like the whole situation we were in as a country is cause nobody wants to step up and do the thing and then take accountability, whether it fails or successful. Right. So if you're going to be a leader, I just want to core things you have to be willing to be the person who's going to take extreme ownership. Like just, I'm doing the thing and people look up to that. People are looking for that and begging for that. Like they desire that so bad. I think there's, I think it was Jay Abraham who once said, he said, people are walking around with like a cord coming out of their, their mbill gold cord. Uh, and he said that they're secretly like they're, they're looking for a leader they can plug into, right? They're looking for something. So the masses, the most of the people that you are trying to lead, like they're walking around looking like, I want to plug into something. Like I'm looking for that. You're looking for the person who's going to step up. Right. That's what you as a leader have to do. Okay. The next thing I have in my notes here is, is that if you want to be a leader, you have to bring energy to the table. Now it doesn't mean you have to bring Russell Brunson energy or Gary V energy or Tony Robbins energy. You have to bring your energy, but the right level. Right. And when you do that, um, there's a really cool, in fact, it's so fun. I got in this business, I used to hate when people talk about energy. I'm like, it's so cheesy. So, well, I used to hate that. Right. But as I've done this more and more, like it is insane how powerful it was. Like the energy you bring to a situation will attract the same type of person. Okay. Um, in fact, I bought, I don't know whether I bought some tuning forks. I heard this is the thing. I don't know if it really is or not, but, um, it illustrates my points. I'm going to share with you anyway. Okay. It's when you get two tuning forks, right? Two different ones. And you hit one over here, one over here, and they're two different vibrations. We bring them together. What'll happen is that they sync vibrations. So eventually they're both the exact same vibration, same vibe. Right. And so what you are, the energy you're putting down the world, you will track people with the same vibration as that. Right. So you got to put those things out there. So if I come into a room and I'm like, Hey guys, what's up? What's going to happen? Everyone else in the room is going to lower down to that energy level. Right. And so you have to understand, like, like you're in charge, like as the leader is like the energy management of the room. Like when we look at funnel hacking, I've got 5,000 people in the room. Like, like my number one role is energy management, like getting people's vibration high enough they can learn, they can listen, they can pay attention. Right. Same thing at, um, in my inner circle, I told people, like, we have two days, we're sitting in a room talking about our businesses. Like it's really easy to fall asleep and it does off. And my job is energy management. I got to raise the vibration in the room and keep it up here. That way we can learn, we can focus, we can grow. Cause if it's not, it's going to be off. Right. And the same thing is true when you're trying to attract people. Like they're attracted to your vibrations. If your vibration is like, Oh, what was me? Things are sad. You're not going to attract the right people. You're going to attract other people who are like, Oh, life is hard. What was me? Right. You attract, you don't attract what you want. You attract who you are. This is a Myringold quote, right? You don't attract what you want. You attract who you are. Okay. We talk about this like selling, like if you want to be someone who goes out there and you want to sell 1000 or courses, you never bought a course. Guess what? Okay. You're not going to attract who you want, who you want, you're attracted to you are. If you're someone who's too cheap to invest in yourself, guess what? You're not going to attract the kind of person you want. Who's going to invest in themselves. Okay. I remember Dean Grasiosi launched a hundred thousand dollar mastermind. I literally was the first person to write a check and he's like, you don't even know what's about him. I'm like, I know, but I know that if I am going to try to ask people for a hundred thousand dollars in the future for my masterminds, I've got to be willing to be the person to do that because I'm not going to attract who I want. I'm going to attract who I am. And I'm the kind of person who will invest a hundred thousand dollars in my education. Okay. When I did my million dollar seat offer, I guess who the very first person to buy it was, it was Myringold. Why? Right. He told me he's like, because I wanted to sell a million dollar offer and I needed to be the kind of person who spent a million dollars in offer. If I'm going to be asking something, cause I don't attract who I want. I attract who I am vibration. It is huge. Okay. Now it doesn't mean again, you don't have Russell Brunson vibration. Um, it's interesting. I feel like I look at, uh, successful companies and organizations. Um, and I look at the leader and the, the team around leader, very similar. Like Jeff Walker is a great example. Jeff's been doing this game for, you know, I mean back when I got started, he was getting started. So it's been 20 plus years. He's been doing this game. And if you look at like when my organization, his organization, try to work together. It's interesting because like we have different vibrations. I'm like the Russell Brunson, let's go vibration. Like that's our people. And there's that that's happening. Jeff is very much more cons, you know, conservative, like slower energy, things like that. And the people in this team are that way. Now it doesn't mean that he's right. I'm wrong. It's not, I'm saying you're going to track the people that are similar to you. So you look at Jeff's entire team, I remember every conversation I'm like, this is so fascinating. Like they're all Jeff Walker's energy. That's the energy level that they're all sinking to. Right. My people sink to my energy. And so it's just fascinating. Like, so it doesn't mean you have to have the wrong energy. It's just bringing the right energy. Like your version of that, your version of like high energy, doesn't have to be well, Russell Brunson energy, right? Your version of that is going to track the right people. Okay. So if you want to be a leader, that's the big key. Okay. Next thing about leadership, I want to share it is you have to have standards. What are you for? And what are you against? What do you, like, what are you not willing to allow happen? What are you willing to allow happen? Right. Um, your people are looking for that. They're watching you. They're seeing like, does Russell Ben in this situation? Is he not? What does he do? Right. And you can make mistakes. I've made a lot of mistakes. I've had apologize to my own team about stupid stuff I've done in the past. Right. Um, I apologize to our community. I literally at fun life, I apologize to get into our community for stupid things. I did like, it doesn't mean you have to be perfect, but you have standards, right? You set a standard and you stick to it. Um, and people relate to that. And again, sometimes they're going to hate you for your standards. Okay. But other people are going to be attracted to you because of those standards. Right. Like that is the key where you're trying to do. Um, in fact, I found a, um, this is something I've had multiple people on my team tell me this is why to this day they've stuck with me, even though. You know, through ups and downs, the last couple of years, um, September 11th, 2021, I made this post and what happened to set this whole thing off. This is during the whole pandemic, all the things I'm sure you remember. Um, but there was a time in that season when we literally had, um, people coming to our office asking how many employees we had and then trying to force us to force our people to do things, which I am not okay with. I'm okay with everyone. Like I'm people choosing what they want to do. Totally cool with that. I think everyone should have freedom of choice. Um, but for me to force something, I do not agree with. And, um, that night I posted this and I'm just going to read it, um, because, um, this was like me setting a standard for myself and my team. And again, I have people to this day are like, because of that post is why I'm here and I'm not going anywhere because I, because like I saw your standards and I, and I aligned with that. And I want to be part of that. So at this, I wrote, I said, what happens when you take away freedoms from prime movers, AKA entrepreneurs for anyone, for anyone wondering how this plays out, read out the shrugged when the government comes in and takes your, uh, takes away freedoms and makes it so that the prime movers don't want to produce anymore. Well, the ending isn't good for anyone. There's three statutes I had commissioned that are to be standing in my office suit. The first represents Atlas, my entrepreneurs holding the way of the world on their shoulders. This is the responsibility we happily bear. The second statue is Atlas shrugging. And the third is him walking away from it all. We're quickly seeing the government overstepping their reach and taking away our freedoms. I don't get political ever online. I don't care if you're on the left or on the right. I don't care if you get a jab or not. As long as your choices don't affect my ability to produce, I'm fine when you do you, as Voltaire said, I may disagree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death. You're right to say it, but when you try to take away my freedoms, this affects everything for the record. I won't take, I won't take away my employees freedoms. If it means I have to pay fine to protect them, I will. If it gets worse, perhaps that'll be the point that I shrug and I walk away. I hope not. I love what I do. I love producing. I love my life. Our estimates now show that click fronzes conservatively created close to a million jobs in County when entrepreneurs start to shrug and walk away. We are all in trouble. Fight for everyone's rights, even if you disagree with what they have, what they want to do with those rights. Okay. Boom. Set the standard. This is what I believe. Right. For you, did your team know the standards? Like what if they put those things out there? Like you need to be willing to put those things out there because people will be attracted to that. Um, it's interesting that in a day and an age where us as humans are more and more soft, um, it's interesting. Like you don't attract people with, with that. You attract people with standards. Um, and the higher you set your standards, the higher, uh, those people will come to you as well. Okay. Uh, next part of leadership, you've got to be in the trenches with your team. Um, I think the reason why my team will produce so hard and they work so hard is because they know that I am producing hard and I'm working hard. They know that I'm here late nights. I'm here early mornings. I'm killing myself on the weekends. I'm like stressed and anxiety, all the things. And they see me doing it. And because of that, they're willing to do as well with something really cool happened. Um, uh, Bill Allen became our CEO for the, for the prime mover side of our business, our info coaching side of the business. And fun, I can live. We've done last day's crazy. Everyone's like, you know, our team's stressed out on the max and we're, we're ready to go and, um, you know, go leave and go party and go, whatever, get out of Vegas and go do, do whatever. Right. And, um, Miles and Clayton who run our events, um, they were trying to leave and, and they went down and if you guys are fun, I can have these big glow sticks with like 5,000 times two. So 10,000 of these glow sticks. Everyone's whacking around when Tony Robbins on stage was literally fun. Right. And, um, and the hotels that they refuse to clean it up, even if we pay to find like they refuse to. So Miles, Clayton down there by themselves, clean this whole thing up. And Bill called miles, like, Hey, just go on and come hang out and, you know, go enjoy, go enjoy Vegas. He's like, Oh, I can't because we got to go, you know, clean up these, these things. Now what, you know, some types of leaders do it's just like, Oh, well, okay, let me know when you're done. We'll see you. Right. But Bill, who's again, the CEO of the company, he's got his own successful company. The only thing like he, of all the people who shouldn't have been down there, but Bill stopped everything, grabbed his kid, sort of run down the hall, grabbed the rest of his, many people's team, he could have went down there and was down there cleaning the entire thing with everybody. Right. Guess what? Miles, Clayton, our team, like they will go, they will do whatever Bill says at this point, right? Cause he lives in the trenches with them. It wasn't just like him trying to leave from afar and like, whatever, it's like, he was down there doing it. Like that's, that's what, that's what people need to see as they want to see. Right. And then the last thing, um, this is actually Tony Robbins thing. Um, uh, I heard him at my very first UPW ever went to, he shared this and has such a big, profound impact on me. Every time I think about leadership, this is the quote that like pops back in my head. So, uh, this is one of Tony's frameworks. He calls it the three mandates of leadership. The first mandate is when something happens, you have to see it as it is not worse than it is. Okay. What most people do, what the 99% of the people out there who are, who are looking for leadership, they're going to see something like, Oh, this is way worse than it is. Like, no, you have to understand, like leaders, they, they, they see things as they are not worse than they are. Right. So that's a big thing. You have to be able to say, this is what it is. It's not worse than this. This is what it is. Right. That's step one. Step number two, after you've done that, then you need to see it better than it is. Okay. This is where vision comes from. Okay. Okay. I saw it as, as it is not worse. Okay. Worse is the opposite of vision. Okay. I see it as it is. Now I see it better than it is. Now that's vision. Okay. This is good, but there's great over here. And then the last step in Tony's, uh, three steps is then you make it the way you see it. Okay. That's the job now to go out there and to move heaven and earth and do everything you need to do to be able to go and actually create that thing and make it happen. So those are the three mandates of leadership. So powerful. Again, number one is see it as it is not worse than it is number two, see it better than it is. And number three, make it the way you see it. That's what leadership, that's what vision. That's what all those things are. Okay. So that's the first thing I want to kind of caveat this entire, this show is just like leadership because I don't ever talk about it, but those are the end again. There's been books written. I've got a book right here from, uh, John C. Maxwell about leadership, right? You know, like, uh, there's been millions of books written on. So like this is not a, you know, all things, but these are the things that for me that I feel are the most important. So things that have had the biggest impact. A lot of things weren't things I was thinking about. I just did it. And then I see the, like what happens on the other side of my, oh, wow. And I see like other people's teams and other companies is like, that's why those people aren't having the success, right? Cause the leader is not leading. And when the leader was willing to lead, that's when everything changes. Okay. Um, and if you've been a leader in the past and you've forgotten yourself, that's a big step too. Like come back and like remember who you are. Um, at funnel hacking live this year, I did a presentation, um, at the very end, it was called one funnel way evolution. It was like part two of my one funnel way pitch from, man, I did it. I didn't invent or I did a presentation in 2017 talking about one funnel way. And this was part two. And in there, I talked about how over the last couple of years, how like, I forgot who I was, right? It happens to all of us, all leaders. They forget who you are. And I was lucky enough to have somebody who is a leader who had set aside high standards, Andy Elliott went out to his office and like, and then in at the presentation, I talked about that, how that like helped. Like Andy helped me to remember who I was. After I remember like, oh yeah, I'm Russell Brunson. I'm just step back and it's calling like it's been crazy ever since then, like the shift I've seen in myself and you've probably seen it. You probably felt it. You've been following me for a long time, right? Um, and so, uh, yeah, leadership is such a, such an important part of the, the game. Okay. All right. So number one is you being the leader. Step number two, okay. Yeah. Three steps here. So step number two is how do you then capture the vision? Uh, and my friend that Vox me, he asked that he's like, he's like, are you just sitting around like thinking about things or like, like, how do you, how do you, how do you find that? And so, um, it's such a good question and it's, it's a hard one to answer. I got, it took me a while to think through this. Like, how do I, like, how do I see the visions I see? Like, what does that look like? Um, the first one, the first note that I have here is like that, that I think there's like, who was it inspires? Like I need the inspiration. Like you don't just come up with a vision just like out of thin air, right? It's like you're looking at inspiration in a lot of different places. Like one of my buddies, um, Dan Usher on my team, he does a lot of our film stuff. Um, he, he spends, I don't know, half his, I'm exaggerating, but he spends so much of his time actually watching film and studying inspiration, getting ideas from the people to, and then from there's where his creativity, his vision comes, right? It's not just like looking at blank slate. Like, okay, like brain, be creative, come something. It's like, no, like you got to look at a lot of inspiration, right? A lot of people like hear me talk about funnel hacking, look at one thing and they copy it. It's like, no, that's not funnel hacking. It's funnel hacking is looking at like everyone doing what you want to do. What are they doing? Why does it inspire you? Like, and from there, what you do is you get influences from four or five things and then you remix them and then boom, you create something that's your own. I remember Dan, I asked Dan about that. I'm like, how do you create your, he creates these things for us called after movies. Like, so funnel hacking life happens and they make, they take all the footage and they build these like, it's like a trailer for them for the event that just happened, right? It's an after movie. And that's what he told me. So he's like, I look for inspiration from 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 different places, right? From now, I'll find three or four things that really inspire me. I take those ideas, I remix them and then from there, boom, I create my own thing, right? And start thinking about it with, with me, it's like very similar. Like I'm looking at a lot of things. Like I think about just pre click funnels. I remember going to click banks offices, like click bank is here in Boise, Idaho as well. I remember walking in, I saw their office and they like international team that clocks on the wall and all this stuff. And I was like, God, I wish I had a business like, like this that actually mattered, right? Clients and clocks and like, oh, it was such a cool thing. Then remember going to, um, I flew out to my friend and Andrew Fox, who, uh, is in the, he's in Ireland and we went on his yacht. I remember being in the yacht that night and, and then, um, that was the same time that the movie social network came out. And we're going, like leaving the yacht, went to the social network and watch that. I remember seeing that. And there's that scene when, when Zuckerberg was like, uh, and he's talking to, um, the Napster guy, what's his name? Uh, uh, anyway, and he's like, he's like, you know, what's cool. You know, a million dollars is cool. He was cool. It's a billion dollars. I remember thinking like, God, I want a billion dollar. I did. Right. And then like, and I'm looking at businesses and brands and companies. I saw like, when Ryan Dice and Perry Belcher were doing traffic conversion, I saw that. And like, and from these things, I saw Dan Kennedy, I saw Tony Robbins, like, and I saw all these different things. And from that, I was like, okay, I like pieces from all these. Like, I love traffic conversion. I love Ryan and Perry teaching. I love Tony Robbins. Cause I was jumping around and energy. I love the personal development stuff. I love Dan Kennedy because of the learning. I'm like, how do I take those and create my version of it? Right. Boom. Insert funnel hacking line. What's funnel hacking line? Right. It's like the, it's the education from trafficking. It's like the story, education stories from traffic inversion. It's the content from Dan Kennedy and it's the energy from Tony Robbins. Boom, boom, boom remix funnel hacking line. This is my version because I love Tony stuff. I wanted more tactics. I love Dan stuff. I wanted more energy. I want to, I love Dice stuff. I wanted more, you know, like people from the community and like from there is how we remix funnel hacking live. Right. Click funnel. So it's like, we're using this software and this are like all these different things to build our stuff. And it's like remixing. Boom. This is our, our version. Right. So what inspires you? Like looking at that, spending time with it. Like, like really, um, you know, evisions come from a new thing. It's coming from a remix of stuff that's, that's good. Like I take three or four really good things and from that I can create something that's great. Okay. So that's the first thing to think about. Number two is like, what is your art? Um, people get inspired by art. Um, I don't know how to explain that better than, than it's like for me, my art was funnel building, like it still is funnel building. That's the thing that I love. Like it's the, so it's like, I'm looking at these different inspirations through the lens of like, what is your art? What's my art? Right. So for me, it's like, you know, Dan Kennedy, Tony, they're teaching their things, but my art's different. Right. And so I'm figuring out like the art that I had and then from there, um, from there, I started kind of mixing my things together. Okay. Next thing about capturing vision is an, is initially, um, the vision is not going to be clear at the beginning. And that's okay. I think a lot of times we're waiting for like this thing to appear like a wave. So like the vision, then I'm going to move. And I don't think it works that way. I think that, um, and, and you think about faith doesn't work that way. Like what is, like how does faith work? Like faith is all about like you see it. You see a glimpse of like some way that you feel like you need to go to call the contribution. I feel like I need to go that way. Right. But then the path is completely foggy and overgrown and you can't see it at all. Right. The vision is not clear, but in the pursuit of the vision, you start moving towards the direction, right? You get into momentum, then like the pathway starts getting clear. I was thinking about this, like stepping into the fog, right? You can't see anything. You step in the fog and you just step down. Boom. Like the fog hearts a little bit and you can see a little bit forward. You take the next step, boom, and he keeps parting and parting. And if you keep going, moving forward in faith, then it shows up, right? And I think, I don't know. I believe that God gives us these ideas and he's like, he plants these little ideas in our head, right? And we have the idea and he's like, is Russell going to be a good steward of this idea? Let's see, you know, plant this idea and they're like, see what he's going to do. Right. And then if I do nothing with these, like, Russell's not a good steward of ideas. That's it. There's no good vision there. Right. But he's like, I'm going to give him a little vision. I'm going to give him this thing called zip render. I'm going to give this thing called, uh, article spider. I'm going to give them these are the, the, my first ideas, right? And I like, okay. And I take the idea, do something with it. And God's like, wow, okay. He's a good steward of this idea. Let me give him another idea and another idea to eventually. He's like, Hey, click funnels. And then even it's like click funnels. I didn't know where I was going to go. It's just like, here's the first part. Right. I'm going to tell you just enough so you, so you're excited that you're going to take the next step of faith and the next step of faith, next step of faith. So that's how God's doing with us. I'm sharing that because for step three, it's going to be how you're going to deal with your people as well. Okay. Because if, yeah, so the vision is always clear. A good, a good example, more recent for me in my life is, is these, these old books, right? Like it's such, it's such a weird thing. Like, you know, I bought a first edition book of Mormon seven or eight years ago, and that was like a one time thing. And then I bought a bunch more, like four years later. And then, and then I started like, just like piece by piece. I got excited. And like, there's something where I got excited about old books. I got excited about Napoleon Hill. I got excited about this. And like, and, and I didn't know where it was going. I felt like there was something I might, I might somehow. This is going to be, this is going to change the world somehow. I don't know how yet or where or when, but I feel like this is something. So I just kept pursuing the thing, right? And opportunities going to me, things will show up. And a lot of people thought I was crazy. A lot of people thought I was insane. People thought, in fact, people were like, should we, do we need to call somebody to like have an intervention with Russell? And I was like, I'm like, I wish I could explain to you as my vision, but I don't, it's not clear enough for me to explain, but I know there's something and I'm moving towards it because I move in faith. So I've been doing my whole last 20 years and people thought I was crazy. Every step along the way. People thought I was crazy, you know, starting all in business. I thought I was crazy building a software company. I thought I was like, you know, everything we've done, people thought I was crazy. And they ever once, why I forget that because the people in my immediate like around my world, like, oh, this is awesome. Like the funnel hackers, the prime movers, like my people, like they, like they're all excited, right? But I always remember this, like when I go to a bank and ask for money. So for example, I'm building this crazy library with all these old books. And I go to the bank. I'm like, hey, I need like a 15, 20 million dollar loan. Like why am I building a big building? There's going to be naked statues of Atlas in the middle of them. There's going to be books there and there's going to be an event center and people are going to come and they're going to look at my books and then we're going to do events and we're going to record the events and it's going to be awesome. And they're like, what? Like, that's not, like, none of that makes any sense. I mean, no, it makes total sense. Like people aren't going to fly here to go look at your old books. I'm like, no, they're, they will. Like, like, no, there's no precedent for that. They're like, that's not a real thing. Like this is all in your head. It's not real. I'm like, I'm like, I have a really good track record. Like look at ClickFunnels. Here's this big business, $100 million plus a year. Like this is a brand I built. Like trust me, like, I, this is another thing that's going to work. That doesn't make any sense. Even ClickFunnels, like because it's software and there's no like tangible assets. Like, like it'd be easier for me to borrow money from a bank if I was a chiropractor or a dentist with assets. Cause like, oh, well you feel like I can repossess your assets with ClickFunnels. Like I can repossess code. Like it's, it's so hard. Like, so every time I think that like, that like, you know, that I'm, you know, inside my world, like, oh, everything I'm saying makes total sense. Cause all of you guys are excited. My team gets excited. And when I go to a bank, it's like, oh no, I forget. Like what I'm doing is not normal. Um, I forget that sometimes. In fact, I have a quote right here. This is such a good quote. Uh, it says, the reasonable man, the reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man. Okay. I think when you look at this, like your vision, like you become an unreasonable man. Right. Um, this is what people are looking for. Like when you're trying to capture something, like I'm not looking for logic. Oh, this makes a lot of sense. I'm going to build this. We're going to do this. Like it's the unreasonable idea. Like that's the, the interesting vision. Right. That's something people plug into. That's where they're like, wow, this is different. This is, this is not what I've seen before. Right. And so I think a lot of times it's that it's like, um, putting out ideas that are just, they don't make any sense. And people are like, I don't really know what he's doing, but man, they, and there's something exciting about that. I want to be part. I want to plug into, I want to plug into that thing. Right. So again, uh, the quote one more time, cause it's so good. The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable, the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man. Such a cool thing. Such a cool thing. Okay. Before I jump into step number three, I got a really quick ad read for you guys from the greatest company in the world. It's called ClickFunnels. Now, obviously if you want to sell your stuff online, you're going to need a good funnel, but if you want a great funnel, then you're going to need to use ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels is the number one funnel builder in the world, helping more first time entrepreneurs to leave their nine to five and to launch their dreams than any other company in the world. ClickFunnels was built for the dreamer and the doer. And you can get a free, fortunate trial by clicking on link in the description or going to clickfunnels.com slash YouTube right now. ClickFunnels, because you're one funnel away from changing the world. Okay. Let's move on to step number three. How do you cast the vision? And how do you cast the vision in a way that's going to attract a players to come to you, right? Both from customers, but then also employees, partners, things like that. Um, and so there's a couple of things. Number one is, um, is you have to live this, right? Um, I, I didn't, I wasn't trying to attract people into ClickFunnels. I was just obsessed with my art. I was obsessed. I was doing it and like people saw how excited I was, right? I was living it every single day and people like, I want to be part of that. Right. That's such a big, a big part of it is like, you've got to live your mission. You got to live the thing. Right. Some people will just, I don't know that they're creating it. They're trying to create this vision over here for something that they're not actually obsessed with. They're not, they're not living it. Right. Like you've got to be the one living this for people like, wow, whatever that guy's drinking. I need some of that. Like that's a big part of it. Right. That's one of the things you got to do. The next thing I had here is you've got to create a really great opportunity for those people, for the players. Like what's the opportunity for them? Right. Um, everybody's looking for an opportunity. They're trying to figure things out. Um, and they, and good people, the eight players, they have a lot of opportunities. So what's the opportunity for them? Like, why should they step into your world? What does that look like? Right. And number one is like, they got to feel part of the vision. Right. So I started sharing the vision and like, Oh, that's cool. I want to be part of it. It's the first part. Right. But then the next is like, how do you create an opportunity for them? You know, a really good example is Dave Woodward. Dave was someone who, uh, me and him, um, like I met him initially probably 10 years before ClickFunnels. And, um, and I cast a lot of visions with him. I tried to do things that I pitched him on a lot of things and a lot of things like, Oh, it's cool. It's cool. But like, it wasn't the right thing. And I was okay with that. And he was okay with that. And then eventually I remember, um, when ClickFunnels came around, we were probably, I don't know, five or six months old. And, um, and he, he knew how passionate I was about it. Cause like he saw me glowing up and fired up. Right. He remember he started coming to the events and he came to him when I spoke at traffic and conversion and he saw me live and it saw exciting. And then he came to me afterwards. He's like, I want to plug into that. Like I feel the energy of this. It feels bigger than like, than just the software companies. It feels like something like I want to be part of, like, what, like, what does that look like? And I didn't know, but I was like, I was like, dude, if you want to come up with a part of this, like we'll figure out an opportunity, we'll figure out a way where this will be better, like this will be amazing for you. Right. And so we started trying to figure out that opportunity for him. Um, and again, at first I didn't know what it was. Same thing with Todd Dickerson. And I plugged in Todd, like he didn't come initially for like, this is how much money you're going to make. Here's the salary. Here's the paycheck. Right. He came cause he's like, there's something here. But your skills, like we can do something really, really cool. Right. And Todd works as you probably heard the story of, we work for free for a year before he ever asked, in fact, he never asked for it before I, I find this smart and like, I should pay you something. So you don't leave. Right. Um, and then, but then inside of that, it's like, we're creating a world where they can thrive, right? How do you create an environment where the A players can, can like long-term, like, I can, I can plant my flag here because there's an opportunity that I could build a business, I could get equity, I could get profit share. I could, like whatever, like the, the thing that ages that, like, well, how do you build that opportunity for them as well? Right. That's a big part. And the last thing I kind of had here was just understanding that the same way that when God's like revealing the vision to you, he doesn't show you everything I'm from. And the same thing is true. Um, when I share my vision of people, um, I can't, I can't, if I were to share, if I were to share with my team, everything's in my head, it would, it would, it would overwhelm them. It would stress them out. There were a few people I can pitch and catch with a hundred percent, but there's not a lot, right? And I know that. And so I share with them what they need to understand for the next step of the vision. Right. Um, I remember, uh, Hermosie spoke at funnel hiking live five or six, like something and he was doing a sales presentation. He said it was so cool. He's like, the problem with sales people have is that they, is that they're selling the trip, not the destination. Right. Like let's say you're going to Hawaii, you're selling a trip to Hawaii. Like you sell the palm trees and the coconuts and the, like, like the beach. And like that's what you're selling. Right. You're not selling. All right. You're going to go on an Uber to the airport. They can sit on a plane for 22 hours. Then you're going to, like all the little things that's most people are doing. Right. So I'm casting a vision. I'm not casting like, okay, you're going to jump into Uber and from there you're going to do this and you're going to, like, like, you don't sell that. Right. I sell them like this is what Hawaii looks like. I've seen it. It is beautiful. You guys are one. Like you're going to want to come to Hawaii. I promise you it's amazing. Right. And they're like, okay. Like that's the vision you're selling them on. Right. But you don't tell them all the other pieces because that will overwhelm and will stress people out. Right. But after they're sold on the vision, right? And they're part of it and they plugged in and they understand it. Then you can start revealing. Okay. Here's the, here's the path. Here's the things we got to do, but they got to be bought in first. If they're not bought into the strategy, the vision, the thing first, they're not going to be willing to put in the effort it takes. Right. Think about this. I think it was all the time. Like had I have known what it was going to take, in fact, I would say probably once a month I get somebody comes like, Hey, Russell, I've got a billion dollar idea. Like I'm going to share with you and you like you're going to make so much money. And I was like, no, like, why not? Like I have a billion dollar idea. I do not want another one. I know what the destination is to build a billion dollar thing. And I, I have been on that path. I've been doing it for the last decade. I have no desire to do it again. Okay. Cause I know what it's like. So when people pitch me on a billion dollar, a billion dollar idea, I'm like, that's the last thing the world I want right now is another billion dollar idea. Okay. Cause I know what it's like, right? They always say like the reason why we're successful entrepreneurs were younger is cause we don't know any better. Like we don't know all the pitfalls and the stress and the ups and the downs and all things are going to happen first to be successful. Right. We don't know about those things. Okay. Um, and so what we see a vision, like I want to do a thing. And so you go down and you're willing to do the things you're willing to go through the paid, you want to go through all the steps in the desk and in the trip in the travel, because you're trying to get to that destination. Right. And so for you, it's the same thing. Understanding, like if you try to spew out, like, okay, this was going to take and we're going to have to kill ourselves and like, you don't tell people that are front because that's not how you sell them. Right. You sell them the vision. Here's the destination. Here's where we're going to go. It's going to be hard, but together, if we combine our forces, this is what's possible is what we can do. Right. They get bottomed the vision and then they don't care about like the rest of it. Right. You know, like after we got, we bought in the click funnels vision, we started running and we were doing the thing and it was like, I can't tell you the, like, I wish someday I'm going to write a book. I bought bootstrap.com a long time ago specifically for the purpose of writing a book to tell the click funnel story someday. So someday you guys will hear the story, but it has not been sunshine and roses. Like building a billion dollar brand. No, it is, it is not. Yeah. The things that I deal with on a weekly basis are things that would have crushed me had I, that if I'd have had to deal with one of those things a year ago, right? Uh, things I deal with hourly daily, like, like, um, like how much you have to increase your capacity to handle the thing is so much, right? And, um, anyway, so someday, someday I'll tell the full story, but just understanding that like the job of yours is to cast the vision and then people start running. Then what will happen is that your capacity will increase, right? Um, the, the, the trials and headaches we had year one of click funnels are things that like now I solve in the, in a text message, like foam is done, right? And they were like week long, you know, month long stress, anxiety, da, da, da, right? And the things I'm dealing with now, I never can handle back then. And so that's what happened to you. Like you're sharing the vision, people come on board and then they're going to go through with you, right? And it's going to break them, but it's going to increase their capacity and break it, increase capacity and along the way, you're going to lose people. There's people who are like, I can't do this anymore. I'm out. I cannot handle the heat. I can't handle the pressure. And that's okay. Right. People are going to leave. They're going to, they were part of your vision for a while, but now they're not. That's okay. Right. There's going to be people who keep going and they're going to go through this refiner's fire with you, right? A breaking down, an increasing capacity, breaking down, increasing capacity. You look at them a decade later when they're still with you, right? Those are your A players. Those are the ones, but it's because they, they bought into the vision initially. So those are some of the things. Again, I don't think it's a complete answer. I don't think it's the best answer, but it's the best answer I have to kind of recap the, the things that I talked about. Right. Number one was you have to step back up and become a leader. Right. You do that by the energy, the vibration you bring, right? By raising your standards, letting people know about their standards, living in the trenches with your team and then understanding the three mandates of leadership. See it as it is, not worse than it is. See it better than it is and make it the way you see it. Okay. So number two, we talked about how to capture it through figuring out like the inspirations, looking at those things, right? What's your art? Be the unreasonable person and understand the vision is not going to be cleared, but your job is to go out there and keep stepping forward and going through it. Right. And the last step was then how to cast it, right? Living in every single day, creating opportunities for the eight players and then selling people on the vision or the destination, not on all the steps inside the trip. We do those things. That's the things that I've done successfully over the years to build up, click funnels, the brand, the people, the team. Um, and I'm going through the process again right now, like we're in the middle of casting new vision and, um, there's a lot of pain with that going through it. Um, but also a lot of excitement and it's, uh, it's, it's really cool. So for those of you guys who have a funnel, I want you to understand if you have a funnel, but it's not converting the problem 99% of the time is your funnels good, but you suck at selling. If you want to learn how to sell so your funnels will actually convert, then get a ticket to my next selling online event by clicking on link in the description or go into selling online.com slash YouTube right now.
