You have to change levels of value to change how much money you're actually making this world. We're using your mind to make money. You're creating things. You're seeing a vision. You're seeing a dream. You have something you want to create and you go and you create it. To begin with, I want to talk about you guys, my people, my tribe, my entrepreneurs. I am a big believer that entrepreneurs are the prime movers in our society. This is why I've made it my life's mission, my life's calling to serve you guys at any level I can. And I started thinking about this like, what makes entrepreneurs different than other people? And I want to quote one of my favorite people on this planet. Myron Golden is going to be running a breakout room tonight if you guys have a chance to spend time with him. But of all the things I've learned from Myron, there's a lot. One of my favorite things he talked about, actually two or three fun hiking lives ago, we talked about two comical lives if you guys have watched their virtual event as well. He talked about this concept of the four levels of value. A lot of times I hear people say like, entrepreneurs work really hard and it's true, but like, everybody works hard, right? At every single level, the difference isn't how hard you work. It's the type of work you're doing, the level of value that you are providing when you're doing the work. So the very bottom of this, the four levels of value is the first level is called implementation. So what's that? Implementation, these are people who work with their muscles, right? It's the person who's building your houses. I mean, any manual label, right? These people, the most part of working the hardest, I see people look on my house, the physical work, they're doing things all the time, right? So if you're in a business, if you're in a profession where you're using your muscles to make money, you're kind of limited, right? People in this window, you're going to make money somewhere between, you know, $30,000 a year to maybe $50,000, $60,000 a year and you're kind of tapped out, right? If you want to make more money, it's not that I need to get stronger, I got to build another house or whatever. You have to change levels of value to change how much money you're actually making in this world, right? The next step up, the four levels of value is unification. These are people who are taking all the workers, taking all the muscle and they're unifying, they're managing them. So the next level is management. So management doesn't technically work as hard physically, but they're managing a whole bunch of workers so they're able to get more work done because it's not just them doing the thing, now they're managing 10, 20, 30 people. So you make more money at management than you do typically the person actually doing the work. The next level up on the four levels of value is communication, your mouth. This is sales, people learn how to sell. Now selling, you're not working as hard as the people doing the actual physical work, right? But you can make a lot more money in less time. You use your mouth to sell, you can make more money, right? So I say sales, people make more money, right? People who learn how to speak from stage, they make more money, right? Because you're using your mouth, you're communicating. Entrepreneurs are communicators as well, but also entrepreneurs, the fourth level is imagination. We're using your mind to make money. You're creating things, you're seeing a vision, you're seeing a dream, you have something you want to create and you go and you create it. That's what entrepreneurship is. That's why we're different. And that level, there's no top ceiling. You have the ability to create and do whatever you want. One of my friends, Ryan Ranna, in fact, he's at an event right now happening as well. He owns capitalism.com. And I was talking about entrepreneurship and he said something that was probably the coolest definition I've ever heard of an entrepreneur. He said, an entrepreneur is someone who took personal responsibility for a problem that wasn't their own. The most of the world, they see a problem like, oh, I don't want to do that. That seems like a lot of work. Someone should fix this. Why doesn't it clean this thing up right here, right? We're entrepreneurs, we see a problem like, oh, it's not my responsibility. I didn't make that mess, but I'm going to figure out how to fix that mess. And we come over there and we take personal responsibility for a problem that's not our own. That's what makes us different than everybody else, right? We're seeing this. And I could go through hundreds of different case states. In fact, every single speaker you see up over the next four days that comes on stage and you start listening to their business, you'll notice as they tell their story like, hey, here's the problem I saw in the marketplace. I thought I should go solve that problem. That's what makes them an entrepreneur. That's what makes you guys entrepreneurs. Everyone else is running away from the problems. We're saying that one's mine. I'm going to take that one. I'm going to fix it. I'm going to serve a whole group of people and change their lives forever. This is Napoleon Hill. He has become one of my heroes over the last little while studying Napoleon. He talks about a lot of amazing things, but one thing that's pretty much every one of his books, he leads with this. And it's this concept he calls, definiteness of purpose. He says that for someone to be successful, you got to have definiteness of purpose. You have to know what you're going to do. Okay. He's quite says, there's one quality which must, one must possess to win. And that is definiteness of purpose, the knowledge one wants and a burning desire to possess it. This is the key. We have to have that purpose. This is the thing I want. If you come, you're like, I want to make more money. I want to be successful. And you're kind of just like, I want something, but you don't know what it is. That's not definiteness of purpose. If I'm definite, it means I know exactly what I want. This is the thing I want. And if I know what that thing is, I can figure out how to get there and how to do it. But most people come in life and they're like, I want to be more successful. I want to be happy. I want to lose weight. I want to do whatever. That is not being definite. We move forward. I don't know the path. I don't know where I'm going. I'm going to move forward with definite of purpose because that's my goal. I'm just going to go for it. Right. And you do that. You go on this column over here. Okay. And if you do it long enough, consistently over and over and over again, that becomes the habit and it becomes easier and easier to do. Because if you can see, all of us start moving forward with faith in our beliefs, our ideas, the things we're trying to create, things we're trying to do. Okay. You're going to be happier. The more things that happen, if you start moving forward and fear is going to be hard. Okay. So these are the two different shifts. This is the key, especially in today's world. You've seen over the last 18 months, the majority of the society has shifted into fear and it's understandable. There's a lot of scary things, right? So we have this choice every single day, every single choice over and over and over again. Whatever things you start choosing, the way you make your decisions today will become hypnotic rhythm. It becomes the pattern of your life. So I want to encourage you guys throughout this week to continue to start the process you guys started by being here. Most people don't think like that. Okay. But entrepreneurs do. And that's who you guys are. It's just so exciting. And that's what's so fun about entrepreneurship.
