Hey, this is Russell. Welcome back to the show. Excited to be hanging out with you guys today. We just got back from funnel hacking live and I want to share with you as a concept that I'm doing right now. That a lot of people don't realize I'm doing, but it's the key. It's the key to actually double yourselves, but not only you're doubling yourselves, you're actually 10 extra profits by mastering this one thing. It's very simple. It's very powerful. It's very easy when you understand it. And that thing is called momentum. Okay. This is where most marketers make a mistake. They spend all this time, this energy coming up with an idea and a product and putting the product together and launching it. And they get some sales coming in, but typically you could buy Google ads with kind of the thing at the time, but it wasn't, it wasn't like today where most people just buy Facebook ads, right? Buy YouTube, Instagram ads. It was, it was a different time. And so the way we drove traffic back then primarily was through partnerships. We had to know other people who I also had email lists and we do joint ventures where I promote them, they promote us and vice versa. That's kind of how this whole world and this whole industry was built. In fact, just crazy. If you look, if you go back in time, you're 20 some odd years ago, when we first started playing this game, it started like developing and figuring it out. Um, it was interesting, like how most people thought that what we were doing was a scam. Like this whole thing is a scam, the whole business, whole industry. Like, and it's funny now because I fast forward 20 years later where it's like now. So what everybody does, every influencer, every everything. And it's like, now we're cool. We know back then, you know, when you're the, when you're the first people always look down on you as the first and it's just funny to me because we've been doing this so long, but we learned some things from back in the day that no one nowadays knows about. Cause you guys all have had it so nice and so easy just buying ads and over time, ad cost and going up, right? And your margins have been shrinking. You don't know this one little secret that's keeping people like me having huge profits, right? So again, this will double your sales, but it'll actually 10 extra profits. If you understand how to use it correctly and it's understanding momentum and how momentum works after you launch a product, a product. And so back in the day, this is kind of the process and how we would do it. Right. So we do a product launch and the way we would work is that we, again, we had to pay our affiliates to promote and initially it was really easy. It was like, Oh, we'll just do 50, 50 split. Like you promote something, you get half and I get half. And that's how the business started initially, right? So starting these launches. And so it's cool. You get 10 people and product. They'd also make a bunch of sales. You pay the half commission and you kept the other half. But then what happened is then more launches start happening, right? This guy named Jeff Walker, you guys probably heard of me start talking about product launches and then, um, uh, Frank Kern launched this thing called mass control, which was basically about how to do product launches and everyone's talking about product launches and it was the thing. So everyone's doing product launches. What happened was it was getting, it got harder and harder to get affiliates to actually promote your product because everyone's competing against each other. Right. So then it's like, okay, well, we're going to have to create prizes. And so all of a sudden you started creating these prizes. And at first the prizes were really simple. You know, really simple. Like, Oh, you're going to get, you know, we didn't have iPods back then, but you know, whatever the prizes were, and then prices got more expensive. And eventually I remember one time I went to massage chair and later I went to roll and it comes back to Dan Kennedy. One day I said, whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins. Right. So what does that mean? It means well as advertising costs go up, you got to figure out other ways to monetize those audiences. So for us, that's where funnels came from, right? Upsells and downsells and cross sales and all these things we started doing to increase, um, how much money we were making, uh, for every single customer to come in. And so somewhere along the line, I remember who kind of figured it out, but this became the big secret. Okay. It was called the launch within the launch. Okay. So what happened is you do this big public launch to everybody, right? Did you do this big launch? Everybody would promote it. Uh, and again, you pay out 50% commission and affiliates. You pay out next, you know, other than 50% left, you pay out, you know, 75% to prizes. You get your 25%, you know, and then you have your merchant fees and refunds. So like you make almost no money from that. So then afterwards you immediately launched something right afterwards. And that's where the profit came from. Okay. In fact, you do this launch like inside the launch. So good example. One of the first times I did it, I had this course called micro continuity. Um, still one of the things I'm most proud of was my first course like took off. Uh, it did, it did really well, but we launched initially and, um, we did launch. We put, I, I record the whole course and these little MP3 players. So the free plus shipping MP3 player offer. And then you could buy the course as an upsell and things like that. So it was kind of this really cool thing. And so we did this big launch and back then we were paying affiliates 100% of the front end and you know, 60, 70% from the back end plus prizes. Like we made no money, but we did this launch and, uh, it was converting. So we got a lot of affiliates from, we got 20, 30 people to promote it. And so launched them doing a couple of million dollars, right? Like it was really good. But again, all that money went away. And so, uh, if you look at like what the actual thing we're launching was this training and this education on how to do what's called a micro continuity program. But then towards the end of the launch, before it wrapped up, we did special like, Hey, how many of us would like, you're learning about microcontinues. How do you just like, if I just pre-built site for you, I come on this webinar, I tell you about it. So they come on this webinar. And in there, I would do this webinar where I'd pre-built the microcontinues site for them and I sold them rights to it. Um, and I can't remember 400 or 500 bucks or something like that. And from there, we made like an extra million dollars, right? All the bottom line, all profit, all the media, I don't pay ads, affiliates, anything, which is pure profit. It came to me, right? So you think about this like I went and, uh, you know, on, let's say, it was a million dollar launch, a million dollar launch. I sold a million dollars of the, uh, this, this, um, secondary product happened inside the launch, right? And, uh, the first, let's say the first one is a million dollars. I netted a hundred grand, right? Here I doubled my sales because I went and I made $2 million now. So I doubled my sales, but I 10x my profit, right? Cause I only had a hundred thousand dollars profit here. And then I made a million profit over here. So I'm more, I guess this technique, 11x, right? But I, you know, more than 10xed my actual profit. Okay. And that became the big secret. So we started in these launches within a launch, a launch within a launch. Okay. And then for me, you started becoming a launch within a launch, within a launch. Like we were always rolling these things forward, right? And the key was momentum. Okay. This is where a lot of people miss like either they're in pain or they're moving towards pleasure or something and they come towards your, your, your offer. Right. They buy the offer. Like that's why funnels were so good because again, the person's hot right now. Like they're going to buy that thing, buy it up selling, buy down sell. But now like they're, they're trying to get everything. And what we think is happening is they're buying our stuff and then they're just sitting back and like they're consuming our content. Right. Like I bought Russell's book. If I'm going to just read his book, like I got everything I want. The reality is those like if they're a porcupine, they want to learn funnels. They're going to read doc com secrets, book and then they're going to go and find out who else wrote a book on doc on funnels. They're going to buy the funnels and then funnel software and funnel like within, within seven days, they're going to be buying everything related to this topic. And then they're going to be out of heat and kind of fades away. Right. That's kind of how we started making money back in the day. Right. And then all of a sudden ads start coming in for the first five or six years. Ads were cheap. It was amazing. Zuckerberg was not selfish and greedy. He just liked to let us all win. We all made a bunch of money. And then over time they got more expensive and got harder. And most people forgot about the launch and then launch. They just launched and then they kept whatever it was like, Oh, Zuckerberg squeezed out my profits. I'm not making much money. It's like, you guys, it's cause you forgot the lesson. The lesson is, right? You can two X yourselves and 10 X your profits by mastering momentum, taking this momentum, why the buyers and heat and offering the next thing in the value ladder next thing and doing this over a very compressed period of time. Okay. Um, a couple of a couple of examples of this, right? So, um, I knew I wanted to launch a course. This is meant five or six years ago. And I want to launch a course called one funnel. Why you guys probably heard me talk about it before. Uh, I think we had almost 200,000 people that took that course while it was, um, at its peak at a hundred bucks, a hundred bucks a piece. Right. And so I said, just like, here's the course, launch it. I was like, okay, I want to build up momentum and roll people into the course. Okay. So the very first thing we did is, um, we did, uh, we did a summit. It was called 30 days. Was it 30 days.com. Um, and at 30 days.com was this free summit. You're going to register for the register for the free summit. Right. We're going to hear all these people talk about their 30 day plans, what they would do, but then after the register on the next page was like, Hey, thank you so much for registering for the summit. I want to invite you to the one funnel way challenge. Right. So it is big. I did this big, um, I did this big, uh, summit to give people's attention, excitement, get everyone from only a summit and it got people in there. Right. And then the upsell was one fun away, but then after someone's finished, then everything we pushed now was rolling into the next offer, which was one funnel way, this $100 thing. Right. And it went and getting five or 6,000 people at very first month coming into it. Right. On the backside of this event. Okay. And so it was the very first thing. And then if you look at the momentum there, people went through the one for my challenge inside the challenge and we pushed people into the funnel hacks webinar, which pushed them into click funnels. Right. So I'm taking this momentum from this free leads, this free summit directly into this $100 challenge directly into this $1,000 course. Right. And so it's like the momentum leaves. And so I spent a lot of money getting people into the summit. We paid affiliates a lot to keep people in the summit, but then they join, you know, uh, and, and we, we pay, we have sticky cookies. We pay people affiliates throughout the, the, the, the funnel, but typically it's like a hundred percent of front end, 50% on, on the, the, you know, the first year and then maybe 30% on the next thing. Right. So like, so we, we tear down the commissions as we tear up the, the, the price points and that's where we start pulling out the margin. Okay. And we did, uh, the second one, one, one play two point, one funnel away, 2.0. I didn't just launch OFA 2.0. Right. Instead, what I did is I was like, I need a pre-challenge to be excited to go into the paid challenge. We did a free challenge called, um, uh, five day elite challenge. Right. It was a five day challenge was free. This is the middle of, of, um, of the lockdown. We do this big challenge. We promote it like crazy. Everybody comes in. They go through the whole process. Um, and then at the end of it, then we push people into one funnel away. Boom, they come in one funnel away, a hundred dollars, right? They go through that process and inside there, boom, we pitched the thousand or thing and again momentum. And then for the end of that, we push, we pitched them into funnel hiking live. We just keep that thing rolling, keep it rolling, like moving them up, valueless step, step, step, step versus when most of the, they launched the thing, make some money, sit back and then relax and let momentum die. And what am I doing? I'm capitalizing on momentum, right? Ever since we talked about FHL, people are posting pictures, like all sorts of things are happening now. Like this is not where I want to go quiet. This is where most people go quiet, like, oh, we're going to take a break and take a week off. I'm going to take a couple of days off tomorrow. I'm heading out with my wife. Um, but prior to that, it's like, I need to set things in motion. So the momentum does not stop. Okay. Cause the thing about it, if the, if the rule of momentum is you're going to double your sales and 10 extra profit, like right now I'm doing, we did great. Right. Imagine I doubled the sales from funnel hiking live, but this time I'm not going to pay the six and a half million dollars for to run the FHL, right? Now it's all just profit. So you know, if I double the sales, I'll 10 X my profit. So this is where the actual money is made, right? As the dust is settling, this is where most people miss out. Okay. Cause a lot of people who wanted to come to FHL, but they couldn't for whatever reason, they couldn't get a ticket. They, they couldn't, they couldn't travel. They couldn't, you know, fill in the blank a lot of reasons. And so now it's like, how do we capitalize on that? So for us, we had multiple different offers that happened during the event. The first was actually an offer for a free, a new free platform. He's launched. This is the first time I've announced this publicly. So you guys are in the know, I haven't done a big launch around this yet, but we launched a really cool new platform called offer lab. If you go to offerlab.com, it's the coolest thing in the world. It's a free platform. You go sign up. What you do is you can go add all your offers in there. So you can add, you know, if you've got a book or a course or a physical product, whatever you throw all your offers inside of offer lab. It doesn't matter what platform you use and click funnels, you're using Shopify, using one of our competitors. Doesn't matter. We integrate everybody, but you just take it from those platforms. I can click funnels from Shopify, from GHL, wherever you want. And you click a button and import your offers into, into offer lab. Right. And then you, you take your sales page, you make a custom sales page inside. So everyone's got an offer and sales page, right? And it builds out this whole marketplace of offers. And then any of us as, as, as, as like a promoter, you know, I'd say traditionally in the affiliate, but it's different than affiliate. You log into offer lab. You see, here's 10,000 offers eventually. Now we got a couple of hundred, but eventually the goals get 10,000 offers in there. You log in, you're like, I want to build a funnel. And you can literally build a funnel like 10 seconds. Like I want Russell's book and then I want this course. I want this back in mastermind. And like you literally click four buttons and you've got a funnel with four upsells built into it and you can launch it. You can push it to social media. It's like the coolest thing in the world. So we launched that, right? And so we have 5,000 people in the room, 1,700 people signed up and created their offer lab account and submitted an offer. Right. So that's great. At 5,000, 1,700 did that, right? But we got 6 million people on our email list. Right. So now I'm taking the presentations where we explain offer lab and working on a campaign where we're going to roll that out to entire click funnels community. And now that'll go to millions of people versus just 5,000 people. Right. So the momentum on that offer will start growing and expanding. Okay. Um, click funnels, we just, um, uh, we did a click funnel state of union address was showing all the cool new stuff and click funnels, right? Which is insane. And then we bribed everyone to go get, in fact, um, here's the secret link. Yes. Right. If you go to launch your sas.com, uh, s a a s launch your sas.com. You'll see this special offer made for people from knocking live, right? To get them to create their click funnels account. We literally give them the keys to a $40 million a year software company. They can run, they keep all the profit. They can white label the whole thing for free when they become a click funnels member at launch your sas.com, which is crazy. Right. So we launched that one. So now that's done. We're taking the footage of us teaching about it, creating a campaign that it will be going out and email lists here, going out, social media, all pushing to that same offer to get more people now. Right. Evernet facial got a, got a early movers advantage. Now we're going to push out to everybody else. Okay. Um, at the event, we make an offer for my coaching program. It's called the prime mover foundations. And so, um, again, we sold a lot of people FHL that, which is great. But now what we're going to do is we're going to be doing in two weeks from now, or maybe three weeks from now, we're going to be doing an FHL on core. We're going to take not all the presentations, but probably take two and a half days worth of presentations. We're going to put them together and do an FHL on core. We're going to launch that. People will come in, they'll watch it and then we'll have a chance to the people who watch it virtually. Um, again, they're not going to get all the sessions. They don't get Tony Robbins. They don't get a lot of the other things, but they'll get, they'll get, you know, two thirds of the sessions that goes through that. And then we'll make the offer there as well. And then someone will sign up there. Right. And again, it did great in front of 5,000 people, but I might get 10,000 people virtually who come to this event now who weren't able to come in person. Right. Now, if you want to sell stuff online, you're going to need a good funnel. But if you want a great funnel, then you're going to need to use ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels is the number one funnel building platform on the planet, helping more first time entrepreneurs to lead their nine to five and to launch their dream than any other company in the world. And you can get a free 14 day trial by clicking on link in the description or going to click phones.com slash YouTube right now. ClickFunnels because you're one funnel away from changing the world. Okay. Now you had a chance to hear my ad read for my own ad. I'm going to jump into three steps now to start implementing this inside your business. Okay. You guys ready for these? All right. Start writing these down. If you're watching YouTube right, you know, post these down in the comments down below. If you are watching, uh, listening on the podcast, uh, grab a pad of paper, come walk you through what you need to do right now. Okay. Step number one, this is the first key. Okay. And this is a mindset shift when you understand this, it'll make everything else easier. Step number one is look at your launch as a break-even funnel. Okay. What's a break-even funnel? I talk about these a lot, right? A break-even funnel. Like my book funnels are break-even funnels, right? Somebody goes and they buy the book for people shipping and then there's an audio book for the order form up. There's an upsell and down. So all right. All the revenue I make through this funnel, the only goal of it is to break even. Okay. Cause again, it's the very first of my value ladder. They're going to buy that and read the book and your experience. They're going to want to send up and buy the next thing. Right. And all the profit comes after the break-even funnel. Okay. The break-even funnels are key. So if you understand that you're launched, your rollout, your thing you're doing is just a break-even funnel. Okay. I don't care if you're doing a coordinate launch with 30 affiliates, everyone promoting, that's just a break-even funnel. Okay. So feel free to give away all the commissions that are to a village. You don't even care, right? The money is not yours. You're going to get to Zuckerberg. If you're on Facebook, you're going to do an email or send it to the email or your JV partners, like give that money away. It is a break-even funnel to acquire a customer and bring them into your world and give them an amazing experience. Right. And to create and like to put them into heat, right? They become the buyer in heat. Right. That's the very first thing. So the step number one is look at your launch as a break-even funnel. Okay. Step number two. Understanding that the real profit where you double your sales and you 10x your profitability is the launch within the launch. Okay. Think about, you just sold somebody information about something. Now inside of that, you're going to come back and you're going to launch something specific. It could be like the week after the day after it might be in the middle of it. You can plug it in wherever you want, but basically it's like, uh, in fact, I, um, I see a lot of people do this really successfully. They do the launch, it closes down. And then when the launch is over, they do a new member, um, like a welcome webinar. And they jump on that webinar and then during that webinar, then they make a second offer. In fact, uh, this is one of the, I haven't told this publicly before. So this is actually one of the secrets on how we actually grew click funnels initially. So, uh, you guys have heard me tell the stories, how I was doing, um, you know, three, four, five podcasts a week or sorry, not podcasts, um, uh, webinars a week, sometimes two or three a day. The way that I was able to do that consistently is I went and I saw it found all the people were launching products. Right. So they do a big product launch, right? That was their break-even funnel. And then I taught, I'd, I'd message them, I say, this is a deal. Um, I've waited to double yourselves and 10 extra profits, um, by doing one thing on the back of your webinar thing. What's that? Mike, you're going to do a new member welcome webinar. Okay. And they say, how's it work? I'm like, you're going to jump on every new buyer's your product. You're going to welcome on. You're going to say, Hey, there's so much, thanks so much for buying. We're excited for you. Your team's working to get everything implemented for you. Um, but right now the next step now you guys product is you need a funnel. And this is, uh, I brought my friend Russell's number one funnel, the expert in the world, come tell you about this, uh, Russell, you know, tell him about funnels. And I jumped in and I would do my 90 minute webinar presentation about funnels and I would sell them click funnels. Okay. So I was finding people who were buyers need. They just bought from the launch. They're the peak of excitement. And then, um, we would do a new member webinar right afterwards, which was basically, uh, welcome to the program and introducing to me. And I would do the thing. Right. So that's the other place you can do the launch within your launch. So if you was looking at, okay, during my launch, my initial kickoff, I'm selling the information, what do I have this next here, the value ladder, right? Moving up from information to implementation, right? Do you have it done with you? It done for you, a coaching program, something like that. Um, that's usually the next tier. So you're looking at what that thing is and then where does it make sense to kind of weave that in, right? Do you weave it in, um, middle of the campaign, just to the buyers, do you wait to the, the campaign closes and do it, the new member webinar after some people do it a week later, like it doesn't matter where, but it's just somewhere within there is you're doing the launch within the launch. And that's where you will double your sales and 10 extra profits. Do not miss the step. Everyone misses the step. Okay. This is one of the big secrets that I don't ever talk about. No one talks about this. Okay. You only know if you're in, if you've been doing this for as long as I have, right? Cause most people stop doing this, um, when, when Facebook ads were cheap and they forgot about, uh, where the profit in the business actually comes from. Okay. So that's step number two, step number one, look at your launch as a break in funnel, step number two, again, remembering that the revenue comes to launch within the launch. You're trying to figure out where, what is the launch you can be doing? That's the next tier in your value ladder, the next thing that they need. They have the information, looking for the implementation. What is that version of the thing you can sell to them, um, on page number two, or on, uh, the step number two, okay. And then step number three is, um, the last thing in momentum I try to do, right? Um, is rolling them into continuity. So we have a lot of offers. We'll sell a high ticket thing, right? We sell something for $10,000. Okay. And after the campaign closes, then we roll them into a continuity program. Sometimes that continuity program, some like click funnels, but sometimes it's not something that's like, okay, this is $10,000 over here. Um, let's sell it for $500 a month now. And so anyone who didn't buy it, $10,000 roll back to K. This is $5,000 a month, um, in perpetuity, like forever. Right. So it's not something that is, so it's not a payment plan, but it's something where they're paying, they're paying a monthly fee to be able to access the same thing that someone would have bought lifetime access to you right for $10,000. So you're rolling them in continuity. So you're taking this, you got to always think about the world as a funnel, right? It was huge funnel. You have, you know, whatever, eight billion people in the world. Then you got like three billion who were on Facebook and then you've got from that, you know, a hundred million to see your ads and you get 10,000 click on your ads and get, you know, 5,000 who opt in and you get, you know, a thousand that get into your funnel and you get 500 to buy from you. Right. So you should have the rest of this whole funnel, right? Everybody else. So it's like, I'm going to go now up a tier. So I have a hundred people to buy. I'm going to go up a tier. I got 500, you know, 500 people here and thousand people here. Like those people didn't buy. What can I, like, I don't want to lose this momentum. Like they came to watch the webinar, they watched the challenge. They got into like, they got into the momentum of the thing. Right. And so you have that in there. Now it's like, how do I take that momentum and how do we take it and then plug it into the next thing? Right. So hey, they couldn't afford this, but maybe they can afford this. Okay. And that's how we start looking at these transitions. And so it's just, it's just understanding momentum, right? Understanding that, um, if you look at funnels, there's a whole flow of people coming through, but only a certain amount makes it to the bottom of the funnel. Boom. So now after that money's come through, right? Then I go up a tier in the funnel and I look at those people. Okay. What can I offer them? They, they wouldn't be willing to buy this. What could they buy here? Is it a payment plan? Okay. Is it rolling to a continuity version they offer? Is it a completely different offer? Is it a course? Is it, you know, and I start going back up the valley or back up the funnel and try to find ways to monetize the people who didn't fall out the bottom. Um, and this is the key, you guys, this is the big secret. That makes sense. Okay. So again, step number one, look at your launch as a break even funnel. Step two launch within your launch, figuring out where those buyers and heat are and then plugging them into the next tier, the value ladder, step number three, start rolling people into continuity, into down sell offers, into other offers who didn't fall out the bottom of the funnel, move up the funnel and roll them into the next program. Uh, that may make more sense for them. Okay. And that's done. Then roll that, you know, then when that momentum is done, then roll to the next thing. Right. Again, if you look at our, at our funnel, right? Even, I just look at the last 60 days, like we did a big selling online challenge. Right. We go to selling online.com and people register for that. And they go through the, um, uh, three day event with me and they end that event where I, Hey, if you like this virtual event, you should be coming to funnel hockey live. We pushed people that momentum into funnel hockey live. Boom. Funnel like that funnel hockey live happened. Now we're momentuming to the next thing. And like it's just always about momentum. Um, like success in this business is so much about that. You don't want to move, lose momentum as you have it happening. Like you just keep dumping into that and adding fuel to that fire. Cause the momentum is such a powerful thing. And when you lose it, it's hard to get back. So keep yourself in momentum, keep your customers momentum, keep that, keep those buyers and heat as long as humanly possible, uh, because this can help make things so much easier. All right. Now do you have a funnel, but it's not converting the problem 99.9% of the time is your funnel is good, but you suck at selling. If you want to learn how to sell, so your funds will actually convert, then get a ticket to my next selling online event by clicking a link in the description or by going to selling online.com slash YouTube.
