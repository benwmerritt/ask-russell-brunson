Hey, today I'm gonna share with you guys eight things that I wish somebody would have told me as an entrepreneur when I was in my 20s. All right, before we get too deep into this, if you're in your 20s, whatever stage you're at right now is exactly where you need to be, so don't stress out. Jeff Bezos in his 20s, he was flipping hamburgers way before he's ever flipping businesses, and Mark Cuban was getting fired in his 20s for listening to his instincts as opposed to listening to his boss. So wherever you are in your life right now, don't worry, you've got time, but here's some things that are gonna help. Number one, a degree is not a prerequisite for success. Now, I do have to admit I did get a degree, but my degree literally has not helped me at all in my journey so far. I got a degree because at the time I was wrestling, I wanted to continue to wrestle in college, I could only do it by going to school. When I graduated, I got my degree and I set it down and then I went to work on my online business. And literally it didn't help me very much at all. What degree were you getting? Ah, so. I got a degree. I did, my degree was in computer information systems because I thought I was gonna be a programmer. Day two of my first class, I understood nothing the teacher was talking about and I was lost, which is why I'm so grateful that I ended up finding Todd, who's a genius who can build software and I can just sell it. I also got a C in my marketing class, which is really embarrassing, especially considering I've written three books in marketing. What if it was a New York Times bestseller? Take that Miss Elliot, boom, roasted. One of the experiences that kind of made me realize this in college, I remember I was at my college graduation, my senior year, we had the caps, the gowns, and everything, we go jam into the gym, and I'm sitting there looking around a whole C of people who are like my graduating class. We're all sitting there with people standing up front talking about graduation and stuff and about to call my name on stage to get my actual degree. I remember sitting there realizing I didn't learn anything that was useful to help me to actually make money. It wasn't a single thing. I didn't learn how to do my own taxes, I didn't learn how to do, like none of the things I would have thought I needed to be success did I learn at school. And we were sitting there confused, looking around and everybody looks so happy. I was like all these guys have to go in the workforce tomorrow and they're gonna find out the real world is not gonna get nice to them. And I was so grateful at that time. I had been trying to start my own business during college. I had something happening. So I knew the next day I was gonna be working on my business, but for all of them, the biggest realization I had is that the degree, the piece of paper isn't gonna help you get a job in most places. In fact, we don't hire people here based on degrees we hire based on their actual skill sets, which are completely different. For certain things, obviously if you're gonna be a doctor or a dentist, if you're gonna be cutting people open, you've gotta have a degree. I would only let somebody operate on me who has a degree. So there are definitely things we need to agree, but if you're an entrepreneur, you're not gonna like school. I promise you that you're gonna struggle because entrepreneurship without creating, breaking the rules, not about following a systematic process. And so if you're entrepreneurial, that's why you're probably watching this video. You're gonna have more success creating a vision, trying to figure out things, finding a team, building something, and really having fun with that. That's where you're gonna find your success and your happiness. There's actually three reasons why I do encourage you to go to college initially. Number one is where you're probably gonna find your significant other or your spouse. Number two, you wanna stay there until you're making more money than your teacher. That's when you have my permission to actually drop out and quit. Number three, don't drop out until you figure out what you're gonna be actually dropping into. And when you have those things, then you're able to go and start your future. Number two, you never wanna underestimate the importance of setting goals. Now when I started my online business very beginning, I remember the goal I set was I wanted to make a million dollars. I think that's most people's goal. But it seems so big, I was like, there's no way I'm gonna be able to hit that. And so I did the math, I took a million dollars, I divided it by 365, and the number is $2,739.73 a day. And so if I can make $2,739.73 a day, every single day for a year, that's a million dollars. I was really excited, except for the fact that at the time I was making zero dollars a day. I was like, okay, well, there's a starting, there's what I need to get to, and I started trying to figure out ways that I can make money every single day online. At first, nothing happened. Little while later, I started getting the importance of making $10 a day, and then $50 a day, and then $100, and then $500, and $1,000. I remember getting closer and closer until that day when I passed the magic number, and I was on track to make over a million dollars a year. And to this day, that number, $2,739.73, is still my favorite number because it is the thing that gave me the goal of wanting to do, to be able to make a million dollars in my online business. All right, number three, as you are the product of the five people you spend the most time with. That's true in any area of your life. As an athlete, if you're hanging out with people who are worse than you, you're gonna become like them. If you're hanging out with people who are better than you, you're gonna become like them. When you're starting your business and your entrepreneurial journeys, the people you spend the most time with, you're gonna think like them, which means if you wanna start making more money, you gotta find people who are already doing that. Your mindset will rise up to be like their mindset. So you're gonna be the equivalent of the five people you spend the most time with. That means choose your friends wisely, choose your mentors, choose the people you're spending time with. If you're not careful, you're gonna drop down to their level as opposed to rising up to the level of the people you wanna be around. This was very true for me when I started my business. Most of my friends, okay, all my friends were completely broke and so I was trying to be around them and I'm talking about these numbers, my goals. They all like, oh, that sounds nice. Good luck with that. And I remember it being hard and then later I found, and I had to go to seminars. That's where I found people. I started all these seminars and marketing events and things and I started getting around people who had already made a million dollars. Some people making five million, 10 million. And when I told them my goal, like yeah, I'm gonna make $2,739.73 a day, they're like, oh, that's cute. I was like, what do you mean? Like that's really, really easy. And I was like, are you serious? And I was like, my mind went from like, my friends are like, this is impossible. There's no way you're new to all of a sudden, like that seems really easy. Like why you set a harder goal. And I was like, oh my gosh. And so like it just opened your mind. You expand your mind differently. You start looking at opportunities differently. I started looking like, what do they do? How do they do it? How do they think about opportunities? How do they create products? How do they drive traffic? All things they had already figured out. I was able to look at that and model it and very, very quickly my income started to rise to theirs because they believed it. And since they believed it, I believed it. And belief is the key that really drives everything. That's why it's so important to be very careful about who you associate with. Because you're gonna become the product of the five people you spend the most time with. Number four, you gotta build your dream 100. Now this is the concept I've been talking about for over a decade. I talk about in traffic secrets. This is where you're looking at who are the people in your industry or the business you wanna get in who've already figured out what you're trying to do. Right, we talked about your five closest friends. This is now expanding it to the top 100 people. Who are the hundred influencers, product owners, bloggers, podcasters, the people who already have the eyeballs of the customers that you wanna have someday. So what I do is I go and set it. I actually create a physical list. Okay, here's all the podcasts that my dream customers someday are listening to. And I write down all the names of the podcasters. Who are the bloggers that are blogging that my audience is already reading their blogs? Who are the people that have Instagram followers and Facebooks? And I make a list of a hundred people. And after I have that, this is my future network. These are the people I need to get to know. I need to build relationships with. Because if I have those relationships, it makes it very, very easy now to get access to their customers. In fact, I create a whole video series on YouTube showing how I dream 100, a whole bunch of people, including Tony Robbins, how is they able in 10 year period time to go from a fanboy to a friend to a business partner. And so make sure you check out that video on the channel as well. Number five, seek out a mentor. Now, if you'll get any story, any movie of all time, the hero always goes on this journey. He always finds a guide, a mentor, somebody to take them and show them the path. Luke Skywalker, Yoda, Frodo had Gandalf, and you need a guide as well. Now guide or a mentor, someone who's already been here, who's already gotten the result you wanted, they've gotten it and they've come back and they've got a map, like a process, a framework to show you it's exactly how to have success. And so for me, in any area of my life, I don't want to lose weight, I don't want to get in shape, I want to build a business, I want to grow my business, always look for who's the mentor, who's the person who's already gone there, they've done it, they come back, I can ask them the questions and follow a step-by-step roadmap. Make sure success is so much more simple and so much more likely to happen, as opposed to just kind of hoping and wandering in the woods, hoping to have success someday. One tip on an easy way to find a really good mentor is look for somebody who's gone on this journey before, they've come back and actually wrote a book about it. Nice thing about that is the book can serve as the map and the guide to help you have success. Number two is a book you can read really quickly, you can read in a couple hours and see if you resonate well with the person. Sometimes you're gonna find something who may have done it, but you don't really like their personality, you don't gel with them, and you can put it away and find another book until you find something you like and then go deep with that person. Read their book, buy their course, sign up for their coaching programs, get mentored by them so you get the success that you're looking for. The first business mentor I had in my 20s was a guy named Mark Joyner and Mark had just sold his internet business for a few million dollars. He was doing what I was dreaming about doing, he'd written a couple of books, I bought his books and was fascinated by everything he was saying. Eventually I started messaging him, this was before we had Facebook, I was messaging him through email and through Messenger, a whole bunch of places and I finally got ahold of him. I was lucky enough to get him on the phone two or three times, where I could tell him where I was at and where I was trying to get to, he would say, well, if this was me, this is what I would do. He would literally walk me through step by step exactly what I needed to do to be successful. And to this day I'm grateful for him and his guidance, this helped me to get to where I am today. All right, number six. Now this one's more of a mindset one, but it's taking more responsibility for your own life. So many people want to cast blame on somebody else. Oh my boss did this or my friend did this. For you to be successful in life, you have to take extreme ownership of every single decision you make. If you fail, it's your fault. If you're not happier now, it's your fault. If you're not getting the things you want in life, it's actually your fault. I know it's hard to hear sometimes we want to blame it on somebody else, but as soon as you're able to take personal responsibility, then you can actually change it. You can't change it if somebody else has fault, but if you take personal responsibility, you can shift your mindset, you can make changes, you can get a coach, you can get a mentor, you can do a bunch of things and actually make something better out of it. That's why it's so important to understand that. In fact, according to one of my biggest mentors in my life, in fact, we refer back to tip number five for more information about mentors, Tony Robbins has said over and over again, the life doesn't happen to you, it happens for you. If you understand that in every single thing that's happening, good or bad, positive or negative, these things aren't happening to you, they're happening for you. If you look at that lens, now you can say, the houses can help me grow, how many of them become a better person because of this thing? Even if it seems horrible, if it seems hard, or if it seems like it was somebody else's fault, take personal responsibility and then you can change and that's how you progress and how you grow. I wish somebody would have told me that in my 20s because I think I've been pretty good at overall, trying to take personal responsibility, but man, there's so many times where something wouldn't happen, I want to blame one of my staff members, one of my employees, right? I blame one of my friends or my parents or whatever it might be. And I realized looking back now, might be blaming those people just kept me in the rut, it didn't help me or change anything. It wasn't until I step back and said, look, I got to change something. I put it on my own shoulders, I was able to make a shift and change the direction and actually have the success I wanted. Me as a now 40 year old coming back to 20 year old Russell, this is one of the biggest and most important things I would tell them is to make sure you always take personal responsibility for everything in your life. Number seven, read expert secrets. No, I'm just kidding, but you totally should read that. But it's literally read, read, read, like you got to be reading, okay? There are people that have taken a decade of their life, they've done trial and error and problems and figured out everything, they came back, they spent a year writing a book giving it to you and you can take this book, you can get a decade of their life and you can read it in a day. Why would you not do that? Okay, Tony Robbins once told me that if you take a book and you can press decades in today's, that's what it is. And so read a book, because if you do that, you're learning from other people's experiences, which is a much better way to learn than going through every one of these trials and these problems and these things on your own. When I was in my teens, I hated reading. It wasn't until I turned 20 that I started reading the very first time. After I found a couple of books I liked, I was like, oh my gosh, this is amazing. I kept reading more and more and more. And by reading, you get better at learning, you get faster, your mind gets sharper. And so that way when you're older, like me, man, think how many lessons, how many things you would have learned and you can be able to use as opposed to if you start reading when you're in your 30s, your 40s, man, you missed the boat. Reading often trains your brain to absorb more information and it expands your brain, it expands your mind so you can control and hold more inside your head as well. All right, and then the last one, number eight, is be humble. And this is important because I've seen so many people who start having success when they're young. I had success when I was young. And the first thing that will happen to you is you'll think it's all about you. Your head will get big and you're like, man, I am amazing, like look how cool I am. Happen to me, so I know it's gonna happen to you as well. So the biggest thing I found is that the first time my business grew and it collapsed and it crashed, I realized it wasn't all about me. It was about my team, it was about other people that were around me, about my ideas I got from God, it was from all these different things and when you think it's all you, your head gets big, your ego gets big and the crash is hard. If I can give you any warning, any recommendation, it's to be very careful about this, especially as you're going your very first time. It's very easy to be proud of what you're doing and you should be, but let it grow your ego because if it does that, it's gonna be hard for you and the people around you and it's not all about you. You'll find that out soon enough. And so that's it, those are my eight tips for people who are in their 20s, which hopefully if you're watching this, you're probably in your 20s right now. I'm coming to you from 40 year old Russell, come back and share these ideas with you. And if I can say one last thing is I want you to understand that this journey of entrepreneurship, it's fun. It's really hard though, there's gonna be ups, there's gonna be downs, but the key is if you really believe in what you're doing, if you believe that you are changing people's lives through your businesses, that's how you last for a long time. I've been doing this for so long, I've seen so many people who have started businesses and then they've disappeared, I haven't seen them since. I've seen a few people who've gone now for two decades or more and the difference is the people who love and they serve their customers the highest level, those ones are still around. People who are here try to make a quick buck, try to make money are the ones who they aren't anymore. And so make sure you focus on who is a customer you wanna serve, how can I help them? And then from there, your ideas of being an entrepreneur are gonna grow. You're gonna think of ideas of products and services and it might be software you're gonna create, or maybe you're gonna write a book, or maybe you're gonna create something that's like, all the ideas will come when you focus on who is your dream customer, how can you change your life? Focus on that, here in your 20s, in my time, you're my age, you'll have an empire and you'll be able to change a lot of people's lives around the world.
