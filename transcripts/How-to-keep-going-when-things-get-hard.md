Okay, when they, when you do that and and you share the stuff with them and they get that clicks for them, how's that feel? Your product Love this guy. I honestly believe the entrepreneurs are the only people that can actually change this planet Is there anyone who has something that's standing out for them and and should we just have them come on stage? I know you're strong in your faith family got I mean all kind of all around What's something that's really made you who you are? Inherently it could have been experienced maybe a quote in the back of your mind That's just driven you it could have been something your parents taught you when you were young Have I million thoughts racing through my head the one that just popped in the front? So I'll share that one I remember when I was a kid my dad gave me a job to go clean the car and went out there I clean the car I did my best job as I come look at it So I you can let me go out and play and he was like is it good you proud of it? And I'm like, I don't know. I don't know. He's like well go go work on it So you're proud of it and then come back and let me know I was like, oh man So I go back out and I was like am I proud of this like I was thinking I guess technically I'm really not that proud of it So I was like trying to do more things try to clean it better and then to a point I was like actually proud of it. I came back and I'm like dad I get cars clean now. He's like you proud of it like I am he's like okay You want play then I think for me like that was such a big thing because it's just like that the internal like am I proud of this thing? I'm giving them putting out there and if not like keep doing it till you are that was like one's little weird dad moments that he probably Didn't mean as a teaching opportunity, but definitely it's been big for me ever since then so I'm right in my third book right now It's called traffic secrets. What's the name of the book traffic secrets? Why is everything a secret? What is that just because it out converts because the word secret out converts in everything secrets always out convert everything else Melanie she told me when you organize this event you said secret project The biggest question I have for you else is I've seen you guys as amazing Amazing group you guys have at click funnels and every time I go in your guys's office It's nothing but just like excitement energy and you don't have to inspire your workers to work for you I'm curious as far as because I want to have an amazing Group like that one too so I can affect affect the world the same way that you have and even do better than you did and It's like it's like a complete admiration thing like that's like cut from the same clock here His dad Question I have for you is how do you find those people is it nothing but like a whittling out process? Or do you see these people these characters already and the people that you have so as you were saying I start thinking I'm thinking about like the partners on our team who none of them came through like a help wanted site None of them came through like Brent went to church with me and he showed up every single week He was my home teacher and showed up every single month consistently and we became friends and then we did stuff together John married my cousin we were on the boat in the middle of the lake and he pitched me on a network marketing opportunity I was like I love this guy and then I pitched him back and then like we just And it was amazing Dave We were an event like this and then we had a sign-up sheet if you wanted to take the speakers out to dinner day Bram back and signed up every single line under mine so into every single meal with him for three days Like it's just I think a big part of it Like I think most entrepreneurs can't build a team because they're they're like waiting to build the team And I think for me was like I didn't know what I was doing So I started running and what happens when you're moving forward and emotions happening like people will people get Attracted to that and some people will come for you know Batteries and they'll leave people and you know I've been taking advantage of multiple times like things like that will happen But the right people will stick around but it's all about it's the motion right that's what people are attracted to is like something's happening Like I don't it's happening But I want to be on that train and they start coming and so I think it's just taking that the initiative like hey I'm gonna start running and I have no idea if anyone's gonna follow me ever But if I do this and I keep doing consistently then people will but not waiting for initially if I would have waited to build my team initially Like we wouldn't have a team right everyone we met is like in the as we may have emotion the right people start showing up Back to like when you're first starting I kind of want to know What's the one thing like when when your business was was really hard when things were really struggling What's the one thing that kept you going give me a sec? Are you going through that now or you are? What are you going through right now? I could see that this is a meaningful question for a reason. What's going on be open? I'm just trying with my business. I'm trying to get my message out there. I'm really I'm just Baby parts of click funnel, so I'm just trying to teach women how to grow a business while they grow their family at the same time I'm still trying to figure out this myself and then teach women how to do it at the same time I'm still not struggle phase. It's partially because you're feeling like an impostor. How can I tell them what to do? I don't even know yeah, I feel like I need to have that success level Before I can teach women how to go out and do it the reason when I found you in the hall And I said I want Russell to be vulnerable until like the nitty-gritty parts of the story and and those stories are what make people Relatable to you. That's kind of where I'm at as I realized that I grow a bigger following and a bigger audience when I'm more relatable To them which I realize I don't need to be up at that level to do that. So my question for you is Have you have you been working with women and helping them so far? So a lot of the people that I've been Coaching one-on-one have been people that have gone through those exact same little things that I have okay when they when you do that and And you share the stuff with them and they get that clicks for them. How's that feel? Like I'm fulfilling what I was put on this planet to do That's the thing that's the thing keeps me going Like it doesn't happen often but happens often enough that like I crave that like last night We're in we're in San Francisco or San Diego excuse me and someone came up to me in the hall And I was kind of like I That nurse talked to you because I mean he said hey just real quick you like legitimately changed my life You changed my family he started like tearing up and I was just like thank you. I love myself feel that Just for a second and then go back to the awkwardness But for a second I feel that and just like like that's what's about you know and I use voxer for my coaching clients Right so every time they box me and they say something like that There's a little star button I start and so nowadays I'll go back and I'll listen to that I'll listen to people like two years ago said something about like how something I did affected them It's just like honey that feeling if I can remember the feelings of the thing I'm trying to get and I can experience it again that it that's what what gets me keeps me going I think that any of us that are lucky enough to have those feelings like a lot times we forget about it It's like no like remember that because that's that's the thing when it's hard and it's painful and it's dark It's that feeling that's just like oh, that's the and you remember that and you like let yourself experience it again for a minute And then for me, that's like okay, I can get back up and go again You
