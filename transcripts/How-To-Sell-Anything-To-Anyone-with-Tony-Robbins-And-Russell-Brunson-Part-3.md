Hey, this is Russell again. I want to welcome you back to part three of my interview with Tony Robbins I hope you've watched part one and part two if you haven't yet go back to the beginning of this playlist and watch those first You help you get all the context of the interview and now we are transitioning into the third part of the interview Which is for me my favorite part. It is understanding the mastery and mastering what a concept we call the epiphany bridge What is the epiphany bridge? It is the way you tell stories to get customers to get people to get prospects to come and become leads to become customers to buy Your products your services and these concepts that work in all types of businesses in fact during the interview Tony asked me how does this work for like a real business like not a not an inform art You know information business or an internet business, but a real business and share the story about one of my friends Who's a chiropractor? I don't want to ruin that part of the story You're gonna love it But how he used these epiphany bridge stories to grow his practice here locally in town as well And so there's a whole bunch of cool things you're gonna learn about storytelling story selling how to give people the transformations They need when they're buying your products your services You're gonna love this is my favorite part the whole thing so let's jump right in now to part three of the interview with my friend Tony Robbins Tell us about the epiphany bridge and how can you use that concept to sell just about anything Without actually selling anything. Okay, actually a little whiteboard for you to show this so This is Did my homework prepared for today? So this is funny Most people if they try to sell you something they come to you and they try to pitch you logically on the thing that That like why they believe in their thing and so I drew this out one day and like this has been huge for me and for everyone That's it goes through my coaching stuff is this thing called epiphany bridge What happens is like this is us right here, right? And we're living our normal life like this I think I could use this my example do before I met you before I started going Your things like I was life was good, right? I thought everything was perfect and I was introduced to you and I had this like epiphany words like oh my gosh like Things like life is good, but like I'm seeing things in black and white now things are colorful, right? And like it changed for me was huge and so I went on this journey where I want to speak epiphany bridge And what happens is we come over here to this side of the bridge and what happens over here as we start studying We start learning we start geeking out and so like you know I went all your events around your books multiple times your courses like and like for you like I'm in the Tony world I understand your language patterns and then I go to like my wife And I'm like and I'm so excited to tell her and I learned all this stuff And the first thing that we all do is we jump over here and this is techno babble We jump and we start trying to logically convince the people around us like like logically like oh, yeah You don't learn this thing and like and we spew out this techno babble And what happens is that people hear that techno babble and they freak out and they're like oh and they and they run away Right, so we have to do if we want to sell something something we have to come back to this thing We have to remember like what was what was the emotional experience that we had they gave us that a big epiphany if you understand an emotional Experience then that's how you sell something I come back and I tell a story and I tell that story then my goal is to give people to Have the same epiphany that I had if they have that epiphany Then I don't have to sell them anything they they have that epiphany like wow that's true And then they'll go sell themselves logically all day long I just have to come back here remember the experience I had and become really good at telling it and in the book um You know it's not just like telling a story I walk through like the process and the scripts and how to control their state This is a huge thing I learned from you because how many people tell a story and like one person tells the story and What something happened you're like okay cool And you know like you try to explain it three or four times and finally you say like oh man I should be there if you were there you would experienced it the biggest thing I've always seen people struggle with they try to get into business or try to sell their advice and things like that Is they get into this like use car salesman mode of trying to like learn how to close people and I'm like no It's not it's not closing like what was it that got you fired up if you can remember that moment And you get really good at telling that story then they'll feel that and they'll get fired up too And like that's that's the key and so we understand that this book is all about that Leadership as you know leadership is all about transferring emotion because logic doesn't get us to take action And then abusing the logic right really only have enough logic to justify an emotional decision What do you think is the biggest misconception about marketing today and what do people if they only did one thing to change their marketing For the better. What would it be? I knew the biggest misconception is that people And this comes down to everything I learned from you So it's people are so tied to their significance so when they try to sell themselves their business that they they try to posture themselves all the time and The posturing like Deflects people and that makes you feel I don't know what it is the more vulnerable you get the better the better it is like when people We have our high-end coaching programs How do you sell that Russell and like I show a 10 minute video of me? Telling my story of my wife and we're trying to have twins and I cry three or four times in it and like and I tell that story I'm super vulnerable and people connect with me And then they and then they follow me and like it's it's it's about connection and being vulnerable is that's what gets people to Draw into it's not it's not significance and stature It's vulnerability and and that's what gets people in and that works for any business I have a friend who's a chiropractor. I was trying to help him and it was funny because he's trying to sell like all the other Chiropractors talk about like you know They're fees and this and all this stuff and how the adjustment in line and all these technical stuff And I kept asking fun finally one day. I was like, what's why are you chiropractor? He told me this amazing story about His wife got a car wreck and and he was in dental school at the time And she got injured really really bad and took her to a medical doctor a couple places and nothing helped and finally He took her to a chiropractor and he he just her and changed her She literally changed her life and he loved so much he dropped out of dental school And then he went and and he became a chiropractor now He just loves it and so we got a video of him telling that story that emotional I got chills just telling it again told that story put on Facebook and his practice was struggling as he was trying to be a salesperson blew up overnight as he started sharing his story and becoming vulnerable with people and I think that That's that's the future of marketing. It used to be slick sales letters good copy all that kind of stuff That's what worked before today. I want to say it's side as people are watching your video They're googling your name and Facebook and you're doing everything and if you're not vulnerable all times and being yourself all the time like you It's too easy to not know and it's all about just that connection. That's what gets people that's marketing today That's where it's going. It's what I love about you brother I mean, you're the real thing. It's so rare, unfortunately And as you know the more you try to prove that you're you know the best and you know Try to convince people and try to be significant the more they want to prove You've never done that I love that you share openly everything your failure successes, but the level succession generated is second to none I really want people to get your book So what's your offer for them so they can go pick that up cool So I pretty bought a whole bunch of copies of this during our launch And so I've already paid for the book and I shipped them to boys even now their warehouse and boysy and we got to ship them to you So I think it's in the US at 795 is international.
