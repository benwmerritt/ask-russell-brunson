So with that said, let's jump right into this episode of the podcast. You're listening to Marketing Secrets with your host, Russell Brunson. All right, everyone, this is Russell and I'm excited for today's podcast episode. We were talking about a book, a room by Napoleon Hill that I actually bought on eBay for $10,000. You know that Russell's book is like 30 pages. Why would you spend $10,000 for it? And it's because, first off, Napoleon Hill is my favorite author. Second off, I am like literally scouring the country, trying to find all the first edition, everything from Napoleon Hill. And this is a copy of a booklet that I found that I hadn't seen before. I actually had owned this copy of the book, The Magic Ladder of Success, which is really fat and big and was published, I think in 1930. And this one was published like a decade earlier. And this is before Thinking Gourage, before Laws of Success, before all that stuff. It was when he was first kind of developing these thoughts and this methodology and his philosophy of success. And it's an early version of that. Today, I actually read this entire book. I have a whole bunch of notes and things are going to go over it. In fact, I doodled out while I was reading the book, The Whole Magic Ladder of Success. And I had one of our designers design one for you guys. And if you want this to the end, give you as a link where you can go and download a PDF version of this. You can print it out basically success at the top, running the ladder. And these are all things you got to do in order to be able to be successful. And if you've read Laws of Success or Thinking Gourage, other ones, you notice that these steps aren't the exact same steps in his other books. And it's because this is getting this was early on his career, still developing these thoughts, his methodologies, like what he wanted to teach on. And so this is one of the earliest versions, which was kind of fun. So that's what we're going to talk about today is the Magic Ladder of Success. How you guys have success in your life, in your business, whatever you're trying to do by following the same principles and pulling hill taught. OK, so to begin this, we're going to start on the bottom rung of the Magic Ladder of Success. The very first step is the definite aim. You have to have a definite aim, something you are searching for, something you're looking for, something you're trying to move towards. He said in here in this book, he said that after serving 17,000 people, he said, I found that 5% of people have an actual aim of 95% are just followers. So when 5% of people are leaders who actually have an aim and like I'm going this direction, I'm trying to accomplish this thing. And it could be anything could be in sports, could be in business, could be in your family life, could be in a relationship, but an actual aim of this is the thing I'm going for. And if you have a definite aim, then a definite plan to actually achieve that aim. Right. Yes, I want to lose 20 pounds. And that's that's my definite aim. That's it. No, it's like, get up. My definite is I want to lose 20 pounds. And then the definite plan to actually get that is, OK, I'm going to do it by following this diet plan, this person, this, you know, whatever that thing might be. So it's definite aim and the definite plan. Those are the two things that are successful for the first run of the magic ladder success. OK, after you have a definite aim, a definite plan, then takes you to the next step, which is self confidence. So not only do you have to have the aim and the plan, you have to actually have belief that you can do it. You have to have self confidence. I think I can actually do this. Right. It's interesting. I always tell people that my head job as the head cheerleader here at ClickFunnels is just to get you guys to believe that it's actually successful because it's not hard. It's been proven over and over and over. I think we're two or three days away from passing 2000 people, the one or two Common Club Award. Nobody between you and them, if you haven't hit it yet, is because you lack self confidence. Like, I believe they could do it, but I don't know if I could do that. Right. So I'm the biggest cheerleader for you. Like, I know you can do it. I have self confidence you can do it. But that's the second rung of the ladder is self confidence. Do you actually think you can do it? Right. So after you've got the definite aim, definite plan, then you go to self confidence. The third rung of the ladder is initiative. Are you actually going to go and do the thing? Right. How many of you guys have had ideas? I'm going to do this thing. I have a plan to go and do something, but then you don't actually do it. I want to be a state champ. When I was wrestling in high school, tons of people were like, I want to be a state champ. I want to be a state champ. They didn't have the initiative to actually go and do the actual work. I want to make a million dollars. I want to lose weight. I want to do whatever the thing is. Do you actually have the initiative to do the things you need to do to actually be successful? So we have a definite different plan. We got self confidence. We can actually do it. And then next is we have initiative. We'll actually go out there and start taking the steps necessary to be successful. Rung number four is imagination. It's not only to have the initiative to go do the steps when you do, then we have imagination, which we create, but to figure out new ways to solve the problems. In this book, he starts sharing a whole bunch of examples like Edison. He had initiative he wanted to figure out to create the light, but then he had to use imagination. Like, well, how's this going to work? I think through it, right? Because there wasn't a plan in here's how to build light bulb. He had to add imagination. He talked about Gutenberg with the printing press. He had initiative, but he had imagination. Like, how are we going to do this? Right? Right, brothers. Over. Like story after story after story. They says the two keys to having initiative, imagination, those two things together, um, unlock the next level. Right? He says these two qualities, the main reasons why the 95% have no definite aim in life. Like the initiative and imagination is the next thing that unlocks that leadership. Rung number five is action. Okay. You hear this so much in personal development. You hear this in the business world. Like you got to take action. You take massive action and go there and actually do the thing. Right? It's similar to initiative. If the initiative gets you started, action is like the momentum that keeps it happening. Right? Taking action on the idea is like despite fear and like all the problems that come up when we're trying to do anything, it's like blasting through that and actually doing the action we need. One of the really cool stories in a point he was shared here inside the book, talking about action, which I was so powerful. He said, a few years ago, I went out to Chicago public parks and interviewed seven of the so-called down and outs, fellows who lie around, sleep with newspapers over their faces, while work is plentiful and wages are high. I wanted to catch a glimpse of the particular alibi. I love to be called an alibi. I knew they had what they believed to be a reason for being without work. Each of them said substantially this, I am here because the world would not give me a chance. Okay? So think of it because the world would not give me a chance. Do the world ever give any person a chance other than that, which when they went out and created by the use of their imagination, self-confidence, initiative, and those other qualities mentioned in the latter? We are not to argue the point that if there is no action, all education in the world, all the knowledge that ever came from the best colleges and universities on the earth, all the good intentions plus all the other qualities mentioned in this magic ladder would not be of any value whatsoever. Okay? And so action is the key, like getting action after you have all these things. So our job is like as you're learning and consuming, and you're listening to podcasts, you're studying, you're reading books, you're watching this video or listening to the audio, the key is not just the accumulation of knowledge, it's the accumulation and turning that into actual action. And that's how you have success in any aspect of your life. Okay, let's continue to move up the rungs of ladder. Number six now is enthusiasm. Okay? Not just saying, oh, I'm gonna have to go do this thing. We joke some of my friends, we tease them and call them Eor, because it's like the donkey. Okay, I guess I'm gonna do it. Like those people rarely have success in life. And people have success like, oh, this is gonna be hard. Okay, if I have enthusiasm, I'm excited, I'm gonna go do the thing and be successful. So you take action, we're not action with like, oh, like dread or remorse or, you know, tiredness or whatever, it's doing it with enthusiasm. I do it, okay, if I'm gonna go accomplish this definite aim, my chief purpose, the thing I'm going after, I'm gonna do it with energy and excitement, I'm gonna go attack it, right? So rung number six is enthusiasm. Rung number seven now is self-control. He talks about like the importance in here of being able to control ourselves, or control our anger, control our frustrations, control those things, because as you are going on this path and moving towards being successful, there's gonna be things come up, right? And if you can't have self-control, be able to stay focused, be able to keep doing the thing you're supposed to be doing to continue to take action, to not get frustrated, mad or angry, all those kind of things, if you can have that self-control, it's gonna help you be more successful. One of the quotes I loved, he said in here, no person's ever became a great leader of other men until he first learned how to lead himself through self-control. Self-mastery is the first stepping stone to real achievement. Okay, so the question for you is like, do you have self-mastery? We're in this constant battle in our mind, like we want to go do something, but our mind's like, oh, but it's easier to go and watch Netflix. I want to go run and lose weight, oh, but it's easier to go to Krispy Kreme and get donuts, right? Like there's this mental battle that we're going through every single day, every single one of us, and learning how to control our mind is one of the big keys to success. Okay, we're gonna continue to move up the magic ladder success. Rung number eight, he says it in more words than I'm gonna say it, so I'll say it his way first. He said, run number eight is the habit of performing more work and better work than you are paid to perform. I like to call this principle the principle of over-delivering. Whenever you are in any circumstance or situation, you always want to do more than you were paid for. He talks a lot about this and thinking, Grr Rich talks about it in a lot of success, like this is one of the principles that he goes deep all the time. It's just like, look, you want to be successful in life, always do more than you are paid for, always over-deliver. If someone pays you 50 bucks an hour to do something, give them $100 an hour worth of effort. And if you do that, over time, people will continue to look at your value and it'll increase. Always over-deliver in all aspects of your life. If you over-deliver in your relationships, you're gonna have good relationships. If you over-deliver in your marriage, you have a great marriage, you over-deliver with your kids, you have a great relationship with your kids, over-deliver in your job, sports, your athletics, your business, whatever it is, like serving your customers, if you're over-delivering every single aspect, then that's how you're gonna be able to help guarantee your success. So that is Rung number eight. Rung number nine is an attractive personality. Oh, this sounds interesting. If you've read any of my books, all three dot com secrets, expert secrets, and traffic secrets, I talk about this concept called the attractive character, right? The attractive character is all about, like, who are you putting out there in the world that's gonna attract the right people to you? And in this book, he talks about attractive personality. He said the same thing, so that people aren't gonna want to work with you if you're always depressed or sad or not putting those things out there. If you want to attract people into your life to help you to reach your goals, you have to have an attractive personality. Doesn't mean it to be good looking, that doesn't matter, but like an attractive personality where you're nice to talk to, you're pleasant, you're not angry at people all the time, like people can have conversations with you. A good book that isn't this book, obviously, but another one to go deeper on to if you want to go deeper on that is Del Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People. Like, how do you do that? Like, if you understand those principles of how you present yourself, it's how you, and like Del Carr, you said, it's how you win friends and influence people, which is a big step in the ladder of success. Rung number 10, accurate thought. This is one that most of the world struggles with. Every time they hear any knowledge or information, they think it's the truth. And sometimes it is, but oftentimes it's not, especially today. Think about it, and Paulie Hill wrote this back way before the internet, way before computers, back when they were just typewriters, right? Before we were having all the social media where everyone in their dog has an opinion, everyone's telling what they think, and there's, you know, anybody can publish anything, it's insane. One of the biggest things I've learned in my life that, that when I hear something and I'm not just always going to be, oh, this is true, I'm going to take it and think through it, I'm going to test it out, and if it works, right, then okay, this is a good thing. I mean, the Bible talks about how this is the principle of the seed, right? Like you have a seed, like it's a good seed or bad seed, I don't know. What we need to know is to plant the seed and see if it grows. If it grows, like, oh, this is a good seed. Same thing is true with information coming to you. Like don't just take everything as this is the truth until you've planted it, you've watered it, you've tested it, you've seen what's happened, if it grows up into something good, it's like, okay, that is true. Therefore, I'm going to continue to use that for the rest of my life. All right, rung number 11, concentration. Are you able to concentrate long enough to actually get the project or the thing done? Okay, can you focus enough to like, despite all the distractions, then back again, this is, I keep quoting what year, but let me make sure I have the right year. The year that this book was published, 1921. So 1921, how hard was it to have concentration, right? Probably not hard, like they had telephones, I'm assuming, they had, I don't think they had TVs in their houses, like, and he was focused on concentration then, like, they didn't have, you know, texting and Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and YouTube and Skype and Slack and Zoom and, you know, all like the chaos, right? And he was concerned about concentration back then. Today, it's even worse, like, how in the world do you get concentration so you actually focus and get things done? Right now, I'm in a room with a whole bunch of walls and a bunch of books and nothing else. There's a computer, but even on my computer, I try to turn off the internet so I can focus and actually get things done. Like, what is it you're doing to be able to make sure you can concentrate on the goal at hand so you can actually be successful? Because there are a million things that are fighting for your attention every single second of every single day. And if you're not careful and you give in to those things, you never can get to the finish line of what you're trying to accomplish. So concentration is key. After concentration, the extra on the ladder is persistency. And persistency is going to lead into the next one. Well, persistency, though, is like, continue to try and to try and to try. Okay? It's not a one-time thing. Success is not something that most people stumble upon immediately. Right? If you were to watch a movie and you watch this hero's journey and the hero, when he tried something, just had success, what would you think about that? I won't let you down, father! Good luck, son! You like this movie's really boring. He tried it and the very first time he tried it was successful, right? Like, persistency is what helps you to grow, what helps a character in a movie to grow and develop and become something amazing. And same thing is true for you, right? Your goal of getting success is not to make this an easy path to the end. It's for you to grow and to become something different, become something better. True success and true happiness and fulfillment in success comes from like, getting through the trials and like, and struggling and persisting and growing and becoming the person you're supposed to be. So, rung number 12 is persistency, which leads us to rung number 13, which is failure. One thing he said in here was interesting. He said that this brings us to the lucky 13th rung of the latter, which is failure. He says, do not stumble on this rung. It is the most interesting rung of all because it deals with the facts that you must face in life, whether you wish to do so or not. It shows you as clearly as you might see the sun on a clear day, how you can turn every failure into an asset, how you carve every failure into a foundation stone upon which your house of success will stand forever. He also says that failure is the only subject on the whole ladder, which might be called negative. We shall show you how and why it is one of the most important of life's experiences. Persistency and failure, these two rungs, they go hand in hand. Like, we are persistent, we are going to fail, we are persistent, we are going to fail. And like, that process of failing is how we get things closer and closer and closer until eventually we're successful. I think people who have been athletes a lot of times have more success in most aspects of life because they've had to fail over and over and over again, right? Like, as a wrestler, I stepped on the mat hundreds of times and I didn't win every match, I lost a lot of matches, right? I went out there, I lost a match, I came back, we looked at the film, we figured out what did I learn, like how do I fail, what are the two different? We persisted, we went and figured out a new plan, we came back and we tried again. And eventually through that process, the refiner's fire became so good that I was able to beat most people. If you haven't had a chance to fail in the past, like it's one of the keys to understanding, like it's okay, just because you failed doesn't mean you're a failure. But the process, the plan that you had tried before failed, right? Okay, cool, that's okay. Come back and retweet the plan, like refigured out between persistence and failure, persistence and failure over time is how you actually find success, okay? So that is rung number 13 is failures. Now as you move to rung number 14, this is tolerance and sympathy. This is starting to look outward, not just for yourself and you should have tolerance and sympathy for your own failures and mistakes, but also for the people that are around you. And one interesting thing about the magic ladder success, you'll notice, is that Holy Hill, one of his core principles in Law of Success and Think and Grow Rich is the power of a mastermind. And he doesn't talk about a mastermind here. He hadn't developed that principle, that concept yet, but this is, I believe, part of it. Talking about tolerance and sympathy towards the people you're around, right? Like if you're working towards a goal, chances are it's not just you. There's other people on this journey with you and like how do you have tolerance and sympathy for them and the struggles and frustrations they're having as well, right? By doing that, it helps you get more people to come, want to help you along your journey as well. Number 15 now is work. Actually going out there and doing the work necessary to be successful. You'll notice that like, suddenly every four or five rungs are about like making progress, right? There's action, initiatives, work, like it's doing the actual thing. But I think it's important because most people think that like, if I don't, like they're hoping that they're just going to think and grow rich, right? But it's thinking, grow rich, but in the process, like your thoughts have to become actions. And this is what we're talking about, Step number 15 is work, like going out there again and doing the work to be successful. If you notice in Napoleon Hill's writings, he always likens things back to nature, like how are things happening naturally in nature? And then how does that relate back to us? And in this principle, he talks about again, says, all nature's laws have decreed that nothing may live, which is not used. The arm which is tied to one's arm and removed from active use will wither up and perish away. So does with any other part of the physical body. Disuse brings decay and death. Likewise, the human mind with all of its qualities will wither up and decay and less is used. Okay, so we got to work, got to keep putting these motions in process, make our muscles grow, our mind grow, whatever it is that we're trying to work towards. And then this brings us to run number 16, the top. The last one before success, and this is the golden rule. And the golden rule is interesting because Napoleon Hill, I think back in 1912, back in the early years, like people talked more about this, right? The golden rule, do unto others as they would have, as you would have them do unto you, right? This is a biblical principle, it's a biblical statement, but we don't talk about it nowadays. But it was, it's such a heavy thing in Napoleon Hill's mind, like he actually launched a magazine called Hill's Golden Rule. When I was at the Napoleon Hill Foundation, he had a golden ruler, his actual, I got a holy guy, pitched me, holding like, this is the golden ruler, and Napoleon Hill carried around with him everywhere to remember this principle of like Hill's golden rule and the golden rule, like, it's such a key thing, like, do unto others, you'd have them do unto you. And so it's the last step on the ladder here to success is the golden rule. And I can't tell you all the details, but the Outwitting the Devil book, the part two of that book, I won't tell you the title yet or anything, it's gonna want to ruin the surprise when you get to find out about it. But in this book, it talks about Hitler and has Hitler's one of the most successful people of all time. He says, like, he followed all the laws of success except for two. And I won't tell you all, but one of them was the golden rule. And so that's why Hitler was successful in doing what he did, but ultimately not successful in life because he missed one of the runs, the ladder, and one of them was the golden rule, doing to others as you would have them do unto you. I mean, you start looking at this as a filter through all the choices and the actions you're making in life. It keeps you on the straight and narrow path of success and harmony and mental, like not being stressed and like all those things right when you start looking at through that lens of the golden rule. So this book, The Magic Clouds, success, you guys. I dueled it out here as I was going, like I wanted to map it all out.
