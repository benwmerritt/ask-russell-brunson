If I didn't have these five apps, ClickFunnels might literally explode. The man, Russell! Pay to sell your product. I love this guy! Love this guy! I honestly believe the Archbruers are the only people that can actually change this planet. Hey, my name is Russell Brunson and today I want to show you guys five apps that we use here inside of ClickFunnels to make sure that we're able to communicate and keep our teams moving forward. Because we have over 450 employees right now, without these apps, literally our life would be chaos. Now our company was actually remote before the craziness of 2020 hit. So we were kind of had an advantage because of that. And the reason why we were remote prior to COVID even hitting, clear back when we got started five years ago is because about that time, there was a book that came out called Remote by Jason Freed and DHH showing how base camp built their entire company remote. And because of that, we modeled that with our company here at ClickFunnels when we first got started. But now because of 2020, so many people are getting forced to go remote. We want to jump in and show you guys the tools we're actually using to do that and how we've been successfully doing it now for over six years. So you can have success as well. Unless you like doing all that stuff through email. Then if so, that's totally cool. Okay, so these five apps I'm going to share with you. These are my personal favorite. Some people, I think I might be the only one besides me and my teams who actually use these apps. But it doesn't matter. They are the best. I think you should be using them as well. All right. App number one is a tool we call Voxer. Now Voxer, I started using back before we launched ClickFunnels and it's kind of like a walkie-talkie through an app. I'm not a huge fan of meetings. Most companies have meetings after meetings after meetings. And so because of that, instead of doing meetings, I can create a group inside of Voxer. I can bring all the core people that need to be part of that meeting. I send them one message in two to three minutes that gets my idea out of my head so my entire team knows what it is, how to execute on it, and they can ask questions and follow up right there inside the chat. And that way we turn long 30 to an hour long meetings into five or six minutes. Best part is people can listen when they have time. They don't have to listen to the exact second we're doing the meeting. If they're working overseas or two in the morning, they can listen to that, get exactly the information they need and the download and make sure they're moving forward. And my favorite feature is you can go up to 4x speed so I can take a five minute conversation and listen to it in half. I'm going to talk to the world, tell you about what's happening, and then when you're in my territory, you can come to the hotel, just come down to the bar and say, what's the point of texting your correct name? In fact, I was so excited to meet the founders of Voxer twice when we were in San Francisco. We went to their offices, we found the place, we got in. First time no one was there and the second time they had moved. So I'm not sure where the founders actually are, but if I can refine you, I want you to know that I love Voxer. Tom Kattis is the co-founder of Voxer. He explained that during an ambush in Afghanistan, he attempted to coordinate reinforcements and rescue a medical team in the middle of the fight. He sought a way to talk to all the parties at the same time, but the government issued walkie-talkies didn't have that functionality. Therefore, he created Voxer. And as of today, there's one superfan who lives in Boise, Idaho. The second app I want to talk about is called Slack. Now, the reason why I like Slack is when we first started ClickFunnels, we had people who messaged each other on email, Facebook Messenger, Voxer, Yahoo Chat, MSN Messenger, AOL Messenger, IRQ. Every single person did a different way that I communicate. We were trying to communicate all these different places and it became chaos. Luckily, about that time is when this amazing app started becoming popular called Slack. First, I was resistant to Slack because I really love Skype. That was my personal favorite, but as Skype started getting worse and worse, we started plugging in our entire teams to Slack and it's been amazing. The nice thing about Slack is I can have individual communications with people. Every single person here inside of ClickFunnels is built into that. So I can talk to anybody in the company at any given time by clicking a button, sending a message, and that fast, my entire team or a single person can know the information we need to let them know about from the top. The way we do this, we create channels for every project. That way, everyone working on the project can jump in the channel and inside there, we can do all the communication for that certain project until it's done, and create a new channel to brainstorm and really flush out the ideas. Because in any company, especially ours, now with over 450 employees, there's so much communication and chat and file sharing happening, Slack gives us a spot to be able to have it all in one spot so we can find it easily, we can document it, we can get our questions answered quickly. One of my favorite channels we use is called Cot Being Awesome. This is where everyone on the team has a chance to start watching what all their coworkers are doing and when they catch something amazing, they can share it as a team and get recognition from their peers and the people on their teams. The third thing about Slack is the fact that it integrates over 2200 other software apps. Pretty much any app that you can dream of integrates into Slack so you can pull in your sales details and a whole bunch of other things and have it all there inside of Slack as well. Alright, for number three, if you know anything about the stock market, you can probably guess what this one is. The third app we use all the time is called Zoom. Now really quick before you say, oh, Russell's jumping on the Zoom bandwagon, we were part of Zoom way before they were cool. Before your mom and your grandma never knew who Zoom was, we were using them here inside a ClickFunnel. So we were Zoom fans way before they were Zoom. So I want to make sure you understand that. I want to make sure everyone knows like how much work is going into this. Our favorite thing is about Zoom. Number one, it gives us the ability to communicate in groups in real time and be able to see each other's faces. It also gives you the ability to have the energy of the room. The same thing you would have if you were in an office over here and you have that thing virtually as well which makes communication, team building so much more easy and so much more powerful. In most offices, people can have standard meetings whenever they need to get together, brainstorm an idea, how to get through a sticking point. And so as a remote team, we do the same thing. We have Zoom rooms that are open all the time, 24 hours a day for our employees. They can jump in and have conversations, get things moving and brainstorm. Now, on top of that, every single morning, we have what we call our Pulse Meeting. That's where all 450 employees from all around the globe all log in at the exact same time for a short seven minute meeting where we go through all of the big wins that are happening inside the company. Jump everybody! One of my favorite things is at the end of every one of those daily Pulse meetings we have a session called What We Do Matters. This is where we find somebody from our community who's using our products, using our tools and having success and we case study that story. So every single day our entire team sees why what we do matters. The developers see why programming the software and why it matters. They see the lives it's changing. The marketing team sees why it matters, why they're getting more customers. Every single person on the team has a chance every single day to see why the work that they're doing, why it actually matters and how it's changing people's lives. And a hot tip, these meetings are short and they're powerful and we're the most energetic person on the planet who starts these meetings every single morning. Good morning! ClickBulls Family! How is everybody? Recently we did an event and typically we do live events where people come into a room because of the lockdowns we decided to do a virtual event through Zoom. We had almost 5,000 people register for this event. For three full days we had a chance to teach our users in a user conference that was happening all virtually. And if I'm completely honest, while all the other stuff was pretty cool, you gotta admit the best thing about Zoom is the virtual background. Like... Ha! Fun fact, Zoom gained more new customers in March of 2020 during the lockdown and they did the entire year of 2019 combined. They have over 2,500 employees working out of their offices. Which doesn't... Why don't they just work from home? I don't know. Number four. Number four is my new favorite tool called Workflowy. Now what is Workflowy? Workflowy is a virtual endless outline that keeps going forever. Before the COVID lockdown I had pads of paper. A lot of pads of paper. And every single time I go to any meeting I had notes. When I was trying to write a book I had notes. And soon I had all these note pads everywhere and then I went to lockdown. And all my note pads were left at the office. And I didn't know what to do. And so I found out about this thing called Workflowy. You can sit down and you start creating an endless outline. And each outline you can go deeper and deeper and deeper. And I was able to take all of these things that were right out of my head. And put them all in one spot. That's super organized. And then each bullet point or each project I can share with my team. And that way people can know exactly what's in my head. Into their hands. And now we can start moving forward with the next step in the process. Now I understand that Workflowy is not revolutionary. Pretty sure Todd, co-founder of Clickphones could have built this mic. I don't know, 30 minutes. But it's very simple. It's very powerful. And that's the thing you got to think about when you try and figure out what kind of note taking app or paper or whatever you want to use. What's something that's simple that you're actually going to use. If you're not going to use it and it's going to be stacks of piles of paper, it's not going to help you. This is how it works. When it's fully open, there's enormous amount of lists. But once it's collapsed, it looks very simple and easy. And it looks like you can only see what actually matters. But then you can dive deeper and deeper to see everything you want inside of your outlines. The nice thing about this is it hides the complex parts. And gives you the ability to focus on just what you need to do today. Fun fact, one of my favorite authors, Nick Bilton, who wrote American Kingpin, one of the greatest books of all time. When he wrote his other book called Hatching Twitter, he actually used Workflowy to outline the entire book. And so as I'm working on my next book, I wanted to be like Nick Bilton. And I'm literally outlining the entire thing here inside of Workflowy. And the last one is my personal favorite project management system. Now, the truth about it, different departments inside of Clickphones have different tools they'd like to use. Some people like Mondays, some people like ClickUp, some people have other processes. But for my team, the tool that I still use and my favorite is called Trello. Trello describes it as the Kanban version of organization. Now Kanban is a Japanese word. Break that down into simple English for someone like me. It's basically a visual scheduling system. It's basically like a big, huge whiteboard with sticky notes on it that you can write on and you can move from thing to thing to thing. Trello is really simple because it gives you the ability to create a card and assign some of that card. And then let's move from step to step to step inside the task until it's actually completed. Inside of each of the Trello cards, you can add images, you can put videos, you can see checklists of all things that need to get done and you can assign them to the people on your team to set deadlines and a whole bunch more. Trello is my personal secret to getting projects done and out the door. I've used project to create tasks as small as like I need to get my car cleaned all the way up to. I'm trying to rewrite three books in one year as well as a workbook to be able to launch as part of the secrets trilogy. So that's it. Those are my top apps we use to manage our ideas, our teams, our projects, and everything running a virtual company with over 450 employees. My question for you is what other apps are you using? What things do I not know about that I should know about? And maybe you'll make it one of my upcoming videos.
