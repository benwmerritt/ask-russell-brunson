That peach was actually really good though. Holy crap. I bought this company called Zoom & Juice and I remember getting to FHL. I hadn't actually tried the finished product yet. I was so excited. It's brand new. This is no one knows it yet. We're about to bring it back from the dead. And guess what? It did not taste like peach rings. It tasted like green drink. And my heart sunk. I was like, oh my gosh. Hey, this is Russell. Welcome back to the Marketing Secrets show. Today we're gonna be showing you guys behind the scenes of one of our virtual real estate companies called Zoom & Juice. Which I'm really excited. I'm gonna talk to you guys about the reason why I started this company. Why I was excited by it. What we've done. How we manufactured the product. How we created the funnel. The people we funnel hacked and why. Who was the target market. How we launched it. The flops along the way. Me on stage at Funhacking Live. Being too embarrassed to even talk about it because of some of the mistakes. And a whole bunch of other stuff. I hope you guys enjoyed this episode. Also don't forget you can always go to marketingsecrets.com and there's a section there where you can actually leave voice questions for me about this product, this funnel. And I will be answering those live on future episodes which is really cool. Also as you listen to this episode, I want you to set your intentions. I'm showing you guys behind the scenes of a business that I'm building and launching that eventually I think I will sell an exit for eight figures. But I'm showing you guys the entire journey. And the end of this episode, spoiler alert, we're ending on this not doing well yet. And so I want you to set intentions as you're listening to this to just kind of think about like your business. Like I'm guessing that you're not trying to launch a green drink company. My goal is not to like give you the blueprint for a green drink company. But all the lessons I'm learning along the way, thinking about your business as you're doing it right now. There's one piece like I can apply that to my business. Like, oh, I didn't, I missed that step in the process. I should do that. Or, oh my gosh, like Russell failed and it's okay. I can fail and be okay as well. So listen with ears to hear. And if you do that, there'll be something in here for you. And the last thing is that this episode is actually brought to you by one of my favorite sponsors. The sponsor for this show is Zuma Juice. Actually, no, I'm not gonna sponsor Zuma Juice because the funnel's not live yet. So take that back. The sponsor for today's show is actually Dan Kennedy.

With that said, you guys, I hope you enjoy this episode of the podcast. You're listening to marketing secrets. With your host, Russell Brunson. Okay, I'm excited today. We were talking about the Zuma Juice funnel. As you can see here, if you're watching the video version, we've got the samples of the boxes, the packaging, everything here for both Zuma Juice, the green drink and the red drink. People always ask me, why did you buy, why did you buy Zuma Juice? Why did you buy a green drink company? There's a lot of green drink companies. And so I'm gonna tell you guys a lot of the reasons why, what we've done so far, things that work, things that haven't worked. And yes, I do things all the time. They don't actually work. So hopefully that'll give us some comfort as well to know that I do things all the time that flop and we're always testing and tweaking and trying to get things working. In fact, literally on my way over here today to record this, Kevin told me they stopped all ads to Zuma Juice funnel, which means it's not converting, which means, I'm sharing this even though it's not like crushing it and doing a million dollars or anything. But I wanna show the journey with you guys because I think there's a lot of cool things you can learn along the way. And it'll help me unpack just the thoughts in my head as well. So this is partially therapeutic for me and hopefully beneficial for you guys at the same time. So the backstory behind kind of where we found Zuma Juice, one of my friends, Luke Jayden, and if you know Luke, he's an awesome marketer. If he does a lot of direct mail, postcard businesses, but then other things. And I remember a few years ago, he launched a new company called Zuma Juice. But I remember when Luke launched, and my favorite thing is the sales video that he made. You already know you should be eating more fruits and veggies. One way to get more of the good stuff is green juice. Do you like yours, Chunky? I like mine a little, Chunky. It was so good. One of the best sales videos I've ever seen. And it looked like something the Harmon Brothers had made and I messaged to Luke, I said, the Harmon Brothers do, and he's like, no, I messaged him. They didn't respond back to me. So he's like, I actually wrote the script myself. And we had some guys who published it and everything. The first person in the video, they launched it and it started going viral. And there's a scene where the girl's a fruit ninja, she's chopping things in the kitchen. It's awesome. And they ran the company for another year or two or something and then some of his business partners, I don't know the whole detail, but they ended up turning the company off and it shut down. And I remember for a long time, I was like, man, that's such a cool company. I wish I could have it. The sales video was done. I remember messaging Luke like, hey, would you ever sell it? And he was like, let me ask my partners. And they never could figure it out. And so every year or so, for the next five or six years, I messaged Luke like, hey, can I buy the company? And he's like, oh, let me ask my partners. And it never worked. And finally, I think it was in the middle of like, right when COVID hit and I don't know what would change, but they're like, yep. And so I bought the company. It wasn't that expensive, but it was cool as I got the entire sales video. So I think I spent about $250,000 making the sales video, plus all the assets, plus the formulations, plus all the work you've done I got for not that expensive, which is really cool. So that was kind of the reason I was like, this would be a cool company. I know the sales video, I copy is the hardest part about any business is the copy and the video. So that video was really, really good. And so that's kind of why, initially why I bought it. And then it was gonna be just a fun project and it was my kids and some of my friends and that was kind of the original goal for it. The very first thing we did is we did a call with Luke Jayne. So again, Luke's a great marketer. He's also the brainchild behind this whole brand and the company and the copy and everything. And we just picked Luke's brain for now. Like, why did you create this? What was the reasoning? Like, what was your goal? Who is the target audience? Who is the actual market, right? You have green drink companies, like Athletic Greens, for example, which just got bought for a billion dollars. But if you drink Athletic Greens, it's literally like drinking grass clippings. But it's like the hardcore people like inject it in their veins because it's like, it's the best stuff, right? And then you got other green drink companies that taste like candy, but they're like, it's not even healthy for you. And there's this whole spectrum and it was like, who are you trying to target with this? And so we talked about the target market and who it was. It wasn't like the hardcore health junkies. It was like people who knew they need to be healthier, but they wanted something that tasted good, but it weren't like trying to drink cool either. Like they're kind of in-betweeners. And with Zoom and Juice, it was like we want something like you would enjoy where it's like, hey, I want fruits and vegetables and breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So I'm gonna have it three times a day because it tastes good. It's really good for me. And so that was kind of the market segment he was going after. We also learned about the tone. Like just from the sales video, like the fun tone, the email sequences they'd written the past. So we could see the playfulness of how Luke communicated with the audience. We wanted to keep that recapture of that. I drink this every day. Then we had to go like to the manufacturers. We found a manufacturer we liked. We sent them the recipes. This one he's looked like. These are the things that are in it. But the original flavor was mint. I wasn't obsessed with the mint flavor. I'm more of a candy guy. So I was like, I want to do the same thing. I want it to be exactly identical. Don't change anything, but instead of mint flavoring, I want to make it taste like candy. And like, what kind of candy? I'm like, peach rings, because come on now, peach rings are amazing. And so that was kind of what we gave it to the manufacturer. And then Luke had also created a red drink. So, difference in red drinks and green drinks is fruits and vegetables. Green drinks are your vegetables. Red drinks are your fruits. And I love red drinks because there's so many vitamins, nutrients from reds that we need, but typically with reds, you get a lot of sugar as well, right? He'd built a really cool recipe for zoom and juice red, but it didn't have all the sugars and stuff in it, which was really cool. And so we took that to the manufacturer. Like we want to make both reds and greens. Greens aren't making it taste like peach rings and reds, like some kind of fruit punch flavor. And so we sent those and that started the process. Now, manufacturing for any supplement company is the longest hardest. It's not like an info product where you can have an idea and you create it and you launch it. Supplements, it's like months and going back and forth and then making stuff and then sending it to you. And you got to taste it. We did tons of taste tests of like this flavor versus this versus this. And some of them were good, some of them were bad. And then we write a huge check in the manufacturer. They start ordering the right ingredients putting them in the batches and stirring them up and making what was going to become the zoom and juice. Then if you watch the sales video, the main person, the hero in the sales video is a girl named Ariana. And she's an amazing actress and model and like someone who's really, really cool. And so I was like, man, she's in the video. Like I want to, I want to use her for ads. I want to use her for the sales page. So we ended up having a time where she flew out here to Boise and then we got a whole bunch of pictures of her like holding the box like this and putting down and like holding the packet and ripping the packet. We got a million pictures of like all the things we would need for like sales pages, upsells, downsells. We need these images for funnels, for ads, for social, just for all the things, right? So we did a whole bunch of pictures with her. And then we also thought as long as we have her, it's still a whole bunch of ads. So we filled the whole bunch of really funny ads. And then we wrote where, you know, she's eating Peatrings and drinking juice and just a whole bunch of short form ads we can use as well. Oh, and don't worry. Unlike other green juices out there, this one doesn't taste like sipping swamp water. She also owns a video production company. So then she went back home to California and we had her make a whole, you know, dozen or two other ads first as well. So we had a whole bunch of assets. So when we did have the funnel live, we have these ads we can use to push people into the funnel. One of the big mistakes people make is they, and I'm honestly guilty of this a lot. I've spent so much time working on the funnel that you figured out the ads and it's like, oh, what are the ads gonna be? And it's almost an afterthought. Whereas now I try to be more conscious, like as we are producing one of the product is we're creating ads along the way, right? Because now we have all these cool assets while we were creating this and that now become the eventual ads. And then it was coming back down to like, okay, now we gotta build out the funnel. So step number one for building out a funnel is what? It's funnel hacking. I wanna see for everyone who's selling green drinks, like what are they doing right now? Like what's the best practice? What are people using? And so we found every green drink company we could find online and we funnel hacked them. Funnel hacking simply means we went and we bought their product and took a screenshot of here's the sales page, here's the one, here's the two, here's the sales videos, like I'm transcribed, here's the ads and we just get, there's many screenshots as we can of every single funnel, right? And so we probably funnel hacked a minimum of a dozen different funnels. And so I gave some ideas like what are other people doing? Whether it hooks, what are the angles? And this is where most people get funnel hacking wrong. They think funnel hacking means like, oh cool, I like how Organifi did it, I'm gonna copy them. It's not what funnel hacking is. I don't know how many times I get in battles with people on social about this. Like, in fact, some other day it was like, someone ripped off their thing, like well Russell told people we can rip it off. I'm like, I didn't say that. And the guy said, yeah, you said that as long as you changed the words, you can steal everything else. I'm like, I never have said that ever. Like it's unethical, it's illegal. I get ripped off more than anyone to use my colors. It makes me angry. Like that's not what I'm saying. I say funnel hacking is about understanding like what's in the market right now, right? It's doing your homework. So you know like, here's what the athletic greens, here's the market they're targeting. Here's Organifi, here's who Skinny Greens, here's who Patriot Greens. All of them are targeting different audiences, right? Patriot Greens are targeting like the Preppers. And so they're messaging us for Preppers, right? Organifi is targeting bio-hackers. You got athletic greens, you're targeting, you know, it's like they all have their segments and it's like, where do we fit in this ecosystem? I don't wanna be another me too. I'm not trying to make another green drink. I'm trying to figure out, here's a segment of the market that doesn't have a green drink yet, that we're trying to target. Like so I wanna get a glimpse of the ecosystem as a whole. That's one big reason why I'm doing funnel hacking. Not to copy, but to see what, like where they are and where they aren't so I can be where they aren't, right? So that's a big thing why people understand. Number two is like understanding structure. Structure doesn't mean I'm stealing their graphics. Structure means like, like are they doing trial offers? Is they doing, you know, straight sales? Are they doing a VSL to one bottle, three bottle, five bottles? Are they doing it to the continuity? Or do they not understand like, what are people doing right now in this specific market? That's what funnel hacking is. It's just, I'm trying to get, trying to understand what the best practices are working today, right? So we laid out the structure, he'd throw the copy, we had the videos, we had the pictures from Ariana. So we had funnel designers who designed it and then funnel builders who hooked it all up. And we got the very first person done and live about the same time that funnel hacking live last year, which is 2021. And so the product was about done. And so I said, hey, we shipped like a thousand satchels of Zoom and juice to FHL. We're gonna put them in everybody's bag. It's gonna be amazing. So the shipping warehouse, shipping directly to there. And I remember getting to FHL and I hadn't actually tried the finished product. I was so excited. Brand new, this is no one knows the end. We're about to bring it back from the dead. And guess what? It did not taste like peach rings. It tasted like green drink. Yeah, I've never been stronger before. So I wonder if I'd spend more in last time with less water or... It was almost like they created it and they forgot to put any of the flavoring in. And my heart sunk. I was like, oh my gosh. But I don't wanna say anything. I'm like, maybe I'm just, maybe I'm sick. Like maybe I got COVID, maybe my taste is gone. Maybe I'm just, so I started making it for like Colette. I had Colette drink. She's like, oh, it's good. I'm like, you know, if you don't know my wife Colette, she's very much like, just like, oh yeah. And I was like, no, like please be honest. And she's like, it's not very good. I'm like, oh crap. And other people taste it. Everyone's like, I thought it wasn't supposed to taste like peach ring. Yeah, there's pictures of peach ring on the packet, on the box. And it didn't taste like peach ring. And I was so embarrassed. And like our first grand entrance, 5,000 funnel hackers all have a packet of it. And I'm like, I hope they don't drink it. I don't want them to try it because that's gonna be the first sample and it's not gonna taste good. And I remember being like devastated. But not only that, like we had printed 5,000 of these satchels for FHL, but we printed like hundreds of thousands of these things that were now done in a warehouse. And then we're going back to the manufacturer and I was like, hey, this doesn't taste right. And I was having the red drink, the red drink is the same thing I bought. Like neither of these tasted right. And so what they did was just super cool of them. They went through and took all the packets, reopened them, dumped them all back in, add them more flavoring in and eventually got one that tasted really good. Sent it back to us. I was like, oh my gosh, it tastes good again. Finally we got a new versus done. We got a box that we got in a warehouse. We're like, hey, finally we're gonna launch this funnel. It's gonna be awesome. We started launching it. Now we started getting sales coming through. But our cart value wasn't as high as we needed to be. If you guys know the funnel game, there's two metrics. Like how much you pay to acquire a customer, cost to a CPA, cost to acquire a customer and their average cart value. So we're spending more to acquire a customer than we were inside the funnel. And I think in my head, still to this day, I still think the biggest problem is we don't have the full sales load at which we need to really get the conversions where we need to be. But then as I was meeting with the funnel team and went back and forth, I found out something that's like devastated me on this product. So this is for anyone who is launching a business and you're frustrated because things aren't working the way it's supposed to be. I was talking to the copywriter, I'm like, where's like this element? Like these things were missing from the funnel. He said, oh, we had to pull them out. I said, why? He said, well, the actual recipe that I built the sales funnel, if you look at the ingredients in the actual Zoom and juice, they don't sync. So I had to pull out all of these ingredients that had claims for like the benefits they had. I had to pull these out because they're not actually in the product. Like what are you talking about? He said, yeah, like the recipe that I wrote the copy on that you gave me, which was the recipe we got from Luke Jayden. He's like, this recipe does not match what's actually in the product. I mean, what are you talking about? I gave him the recipe, I said, build that. And like I go to the manufacturer. I'm like, this is the recipe I gave you. This is what's in here, right? And they're like, yeah, that's what's in there. I'm like, are you sure? Copy told me, anyway, we'll go back and forth. And also I get a message from the manufacturer. They're like, oh my gosh, we're so sorry. We see the mistake. You're right. Like the recipe you gave us is not what the Zoom and juice is. And I just sat there and I was like, oh my gosh. Like literally probably, I mean, my hard cost for inventory are over six figures, $150,000 or more inventory that's now sitting there and it's not the right formula. And I'm like, oh my gosh, like what do I do? Do I just like not say anything? And just like, oh, well, we'll just tweak the copy. But I was like, man, I didn't want to go create a product that just tasted good. I wanted to create a product that matched the promises we were trying to make for the audience we were trying to make it for. And so I went back to the manufacturer and they're like, well, fix it. We're so sorry. But I was like, you know what? There's just been a couple of mistakes. And so we decided to transfer over to a different manufacturer we used for other products in the past. I gave them the new recipe. And right now we're literally in the middle of doing taste testing with them. Going through the same process of like, okay, how to make peat string taste good with the formula has all the stuff we need to. I think that's part of the problem is like, they couldn't get it taste right with our formulas. They pulled some of the things out to make it taste right. It's like, no, we can't, we couldn't do that. And so we're going back and forth. In fact, we have a couple of different flavors we're taste testing like a sour apple, which is really good kiwi strawberry. And there's like a mojito one, which is really good. And then on a fruit punch, we're testing a bunch of flavors as well. So we're doing the whole process over again, which sucks and it's slow. So we were working on the new version, but in the interim, we have $100,000 worth of inventory of a product that's good and it tastes good. But as you guys know, my belief good is the enemy to great. And if I want this to be something I'm proud of, and it's gotta be great. And so right now we're doing testing in the funnel. We were testing another version of the funnel. It's a short form like free plus shipping. They can't get two packs of peat string, two packs of fruit, you know, red and green for free, cover shipping handling, and then from there, pushing it up self funnel, just testing them things at a small scale to see what we can do to get the conversions right. So when we do have the new product, we can blow it up. And so this is the game, right? This is a game we all signed up for. There's the ups, the downs, the positives, the negatives, the pros, the cons. But that's what I wanted to share inside of these episodes. I hope by listening to the Zoom and Juice stuff, you got some ideas, you got some thoughts about the process of how we do it from, like why would I pick this business? Like what is the most valuable asset to me? It's the copy, right? Like I bought this company because of the copy. That was the reason why. Trying to figure out like who's the actual avatar for this? And funnel hacking to figure out who the, which avatars are already being served and who which the avatar that we need to actually go after. I'm also understanding that like, look, just cause I'm Russell, just cause I'm the funnel dude who builds funnels, who's obsessed with funnel hacks, 15 funnels before we built this one. It doesn't always work the first time I get it. Usually in fact, it doesn't. Hopefully it helps also knowing that like, I have problems with manufacturing. Hopefully when you grow the manufacturer, you make sure that when you get the sample, that you know this is the actual formula. It's the correct formula. Like, okay, this tastes good. Is this based on this exact formula? But the cool thing is like when this is done, when it's right, then we start growing and we get to 100 customers, then a thousand, then 5,000. And then, you know, I was talking to Ryan Moran about this. He talks about supplement companies. Like you get 5,000 active customers on supplement. You can sell that company for $10 million. So from my mind, this is the goal. Like how do we get 5,000 people on Zuma Juice and then exit for $10 million? Like that becomes a fun virtual real estate property. It's like building a house on park place and like adding the people and all sorts of stuff. And then you sell it for, you know, for eight figures. And again, if you enjoyed this episode, please, please, please share with other people. That is how you can get back to me the most cause I'm doing these for free cause I love sharing number two, but a number one with number two, hopefully you get some value from it. So if you do, please share it with other people. Talk about it on Facebook, share it on forums, post it on your feed, like whatever it is, let people know about it. And if you have questions about this product or any project, go to marketingsecrets.com. Again, there's a block there where you can submit voice questions and I listen to those questions and we'll pull those ones back in. Maybe my next Zuma Juice episode, if you guys ask questions specifically about this or maybe if you watch the YouTube version, you post it down below. My team can pull those questions and we can answer them. At the beginning of the episode, you know, the next Zuma Juice episode, and that way we can kind of have this as an open dialogue, which makes it more fun for me and hopefully for you as well. So that's kind of the game plan you guys. I hope you enjoyed this episode. We'll see you guys on the next episode of the Marketing Seeker Show.
