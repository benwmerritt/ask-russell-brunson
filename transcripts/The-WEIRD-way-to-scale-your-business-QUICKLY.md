How many of you guys are selling supplements or you'd like to sell supplements? Cool. How many of you guys have heard of Dave Asprey, the bulletproof executive? So he sells supplements. He sells fat and coffee and oils and much stuff. He actually launched a brick and mortar coffee shop called Bulletproof. Dave was smart. He wrapped this entire company, the supplement company, the retail store, everything in the information business, right? So if you back it up, he's got events like this and he's biohacking. He's got his books. He's got his podcasts. He's got his blog, right? So he led first with building this community, building his expertise, getting people to think he's an expert. And now guess what happens? Every time Dave comes out with some new magic pill, he's like, hey, here's my new supplement. Guess what people like me do? We don't read anything. We don't look at his sales letter. We're just trying to find the added cart button as quick as we can because Dave said this is awesome. Like he's interviewed like eight billion people on a podcast for this huge blog. Like he's awesome. I trust him. I'm in whatever it is. Half of you guys, this is not your business model, but I still think that this is the key to you growing and scaling a business. First off, if you guys do this, it will completely simplify your sales process. A lot of businesses you guys are in, you're selling commodities, right? Especially local businesses and things like that. When you follow this, this process, it makes it so the price is no longer relevant to the conversation. If you want people to buy into what you're doing, it's more than just I'm selling this thing, right? It's given him value. It's given him information. And the best way to do that I believe is through positioning yourself as an expert. The last one is it gives you the ability to generate customers for free. I know a lot of our businesses have very low profit margins. And so it's hard because it's hard to create a funnel because I can't break even. I can't make a profit on these funnels. If you lead with an information funnel, you can use that to break even, be profitable, and then the next thing you sell your real business, whatever that thing is, becomes pure profit. People always come in all the time and Russell like, I'm selling tractors. My profit margin is 3% on a $85,000 thing. How should I do this? I'm like, well, it's hard. Like your profit margins are horrible. It's hard to buy Facebook ads to sell for $80,000 tractor. It's hard. I get it. And so the way we do that is we take a business and we wrap it around an expert, around something like that. And when you do that, what happens is this info business now could stand by itself. It positions you differently. The dot com secrets book, we sold a lot of them, right? So one of the guys that bought the book, he got it, he read it, and he was like, this is awesome. And he called our office like a week later and he said, I want Russell to come out to our office for two days and train my entire staff at everything in the book. And I was like, I don't really want to do that. And so Randy comes like, this guy wants you to do that. I'm like, no, I don't want to do that. And he's like, okay, I'll tell him. He comes back. This guy's willing to pay whatever it takes for you to fly out for two days and train his staff. I'm like, okay, tell him for $100,000, I'll fly out there for two days. I'm like, kind of like, all right. And then Randy comes back. Okay, he's in. Like what? But the best thing is that info business is all profit. All right, so I can go and I can buy Facebook ads. I can buy Google ads. I can buy, I can do all these things. And even if I don't ever make a penny ever, if I just break even, all of a sudden I'm getting customers for free. Now I can send them my sales guys. I can buy my other things. I can do all sorts of other things. This, I've learned some Nankanese. Whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins, right? And so if you can't spend a crap ton of money to acquire a customer, you're going to struggle. You have a store this vacant all the time. You put in these front end funnels that are profitable up front. Now you can spend a lot more money to acquire a customer. Now you can fill up your whole store and have a bunch of stuff. When we launched ClickFunnels, it completely bombed. It was the most embarrassing thing. We spent like a year and a half. We spent all this money, time, effort. We're like, this is going to be the greatest thing in the world. Our initial projections when we launched it was 10,000 customers in the first seven days. Imagine our disappointment seven days later, we had like a hundred. And I was like, does everyone not understand what we're giving them? This thing is amazing. And nobody did. I was like, and we tried about three months thing after thing after thing. We could not get people to understand this. They'd come there and most people didn't know what a funnel was. They didn't understand the process or why it was even important. It was just there needed some education there. Three months into launch, this company came back and we wrote a webinar. During this presentation, I'm going to cover three secrets. So secret number one, I'm going to show you guys how to ethically steal over a million dollars worth of funnel hacks from your competitors within the first 12 months of launching that webinar did over $12 million in sales and built ClickFunnels from the ground up. And same thing with the book. We put it out there and it helped the world to understand the crazy stuff happening in my head. Like what are the funnels and how do they work together and what are the scripts we use? And this was really what kind of began this transformation, this mission for us. This is kind of like the playbook. The second book, expert secrets. I have some friends that have written like big diet books, right? Like Dave Aspery told me, he's like, yeah, most fitness authors, they write initial book teaching their plan. And the second book is a cookbook with like, here's all the recipes to execute that plan. Dotcom secrets was like, here's the overall strategy. So funnels work and how all the, all the different pieces work together. Expert secrets for me is kind of like a cookbook. Right? I didn't write the book because I wanted to sell a book. The real reason I knew was that anybody who reads that book, they're indoctrinated in my way of thinking, who here's selling information products and becoming an expert.
