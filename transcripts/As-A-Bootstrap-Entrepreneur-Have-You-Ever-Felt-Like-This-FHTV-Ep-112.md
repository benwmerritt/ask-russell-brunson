Hey, come on in. We're gonna show you the big room villa of our suite room. So we're not this. Wow. Wow. Duh. Ha ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha. Every day when you have success, there's a story there that's more valuable than a success. When you fail, there's a story there that's more valuable than the failure. It was the story you need to inspire people to sell your next product, to do your next thing, to create your movement, to call a new segment of people into the marketplace, whatever it is for you. Like the stories, the key. So keep your eyes open for stories that are happening around you. Okay, we are packing to go to the launch for the year of in. We're so excited. Hey, Collette, what are you doing now? Hey, we're getting ready to go to some event. I was a black tie event. Oh, man, you're so excited. And we're living out of the basement. So that's why everything's out here instead of in our bedroom. There you go. Earlier this year, I submitted for the entrepreneurial year of our region and I won it, which was really cool. And then basically all the regions get together and do a national tournament. And so I was all excited to go to this national thing and compete and see if we can win the national entrepreneurial year award. Are you sad? Are you happy? Mom and Dad are you gonna be playing with grandma? Are you so fun? Oh, I love you, baby. Always late, I don't know what it is. Always late. Dave, what's going on? We're late to the airport again. It's always my fault. This was kind of Dave's fault though, a little bit. This was so my fault. I really thought, oh, no problem. We got plenty of time. Mom and Dad was like, doesn't the flight leave at 1.30? I'm like, yeah, what time is it? It's 1.15. I'm like, okay, I better pack. But this is the thing about flying private. They're on my schedule. I'm not on there. So we will show up when we want to. So Dave, how are you feeling about the competition this weekend? I'm so nervous for us. You have no idea because there's nothing more frustrating about competing when you can't do anything. I think it's the lamest type of competition you could ever have. It's like, we're just gonna think about what you did and talked about and whoever said it, we're gonna use their recommendation and hopefully that's good enough. Unless we win, then we thrash them all because we deserve it. If we lose though, we have tons of excuses. I thought like, if we're gonna do this, we should make an experience out of it, right? So that way we can do an episode fun on our TV. That way it's not just like me going somewhere on an event because I go to a lot of events and it's just like boring. So I'm like, how to make this memorable for me and for my wife and for anyone else I want to bring. So the question I have for you guys is quick funnels was to get its own jet. What would you think about that? I was actually visualizing the gears on the fin last night. Ooh! Yeah! I love that! If you can visualize it can happen. Absolutely! We made it! How late are we Dave? For context. 27 minutes. 27 minutes. Like we can just fly there or we would have been like, did it upright and like ran into private planes. So we ran into private planes. We were like, what's the point of this? We ran into private planes. So we ran into private planes. We are landing in Salt Lake right now. To pick up some of my special guests. And I'm excited. It's my mom and my dad. So this is fun. So my mom and dad, amazing human beings. My dad's a great entrepreneur but they've been very frugal their entire life. They always fly coach. They always do everything. So last time we flew to Boise and I bought them a ticket. I bought them first class. And they were like, well we can't do first class. Anyway, my mom saw a video of me in a private jet. She's like, you can't fly private. Everyone dies private. Like, anyway, so she's convinced it's like, it's really bad. I mess with my dad a couple of days ago. I said, dad this is the plan. We're picking us up in a private jet. Hope that's okay. Your job, you don't tell mom. I'm convinced it's okay. So her first thing is she started freaking out. I guess like, thinking it was like a little puddle jumper plane. And then if I know it's an actual airplane, she's just gonna be alright. I flew down, picked my parents up at Salt Lake. My mom was certain she was gonna die on the plane. She read a book about someone who got on a plane wreck one time. So because of that she was convinced that she was like, certain death was the only possibility, the only possible outcome for this vacation. It was really hard to convince her to go. But she agreed finally. We don't even fly first class. So to get on a private plane is just almost unbelievable. Incredible. We're excited. Dave, you're talking about bombing just flying the airplane? Very good. And... How was the mom? Did you survive? Yeah, I'm so far so good. Thank you. My mom just started telling these guys about what Russ was like as little kids. Let's hear the real story. He would get all this mail, this junk mail, and he would just put it in his bedroom on the floor. He also, once they got to high school, or junior high, I can't remember, I made him do their own laundry. So he'd do his laundry and he'd just throw that after it was all clean onto the floor with all this paperwork. Because it couldn't be on the bed because he had to sleep in the bed. And the room just kept it. As a junk mail hoarder. You would think that we'd be able to be treated with the utmost respect. And unfortunately for some reason we have all double beds. Now, it usually would come here to celebrate and you would want at least a king-size bed to be able to celebrate the success that you're having. So if we're getting one that has a king-size bed, it's a big Murphy bed. So it actually pulls down from the wall. Hey, come on in. We're going to show you the big reveal of our suite room. He's so excited. He's so worried about this. He's so worried about this. He's hilarious. He's so good. Oh, no way. He's so good. Here it comes. Wow. Ta-da. We flew private because we want to make a nice, serious experience. But they don't have a bed. That night we got there, they did it right. They had this huge dinner with this amazing buffet. And it was amazing. I've been to a lot of buffets. This was like four steps past anything they've ever been to before. They just deserve bar. They literally had a donut wall. All right. This is the donut wall. And then they had chocolate covered bacon. And they had this thing. It looked like a big ice cream bar with tons of types of ice cream flavors. But it wasn't ice cream. It was cookie dough. It was a cookie dough bar. What in the world? What kind of cheese did you get? I got chocolate chips. Chocolate chips. Chocolate chips. Chocolate chips. Everyone picks chocolate chips. It was insane. They scooped out tons of cookie dough into the thing. And the desserts alone were, ugh. So I just felt like we're at Pleasure Island. I'm Pinocchio. I'm turning the donkey in any minute now. I'm driving cookie dough bar, donut bar, marshmallow bar. So actually getting sick of my stomach right now. It's so worth it. Anyway, it was amazing. And then there was the Kelly Clarkson concert. She did this huge show for us, a private event. Mike, for example, Jennifer Gardner came and spoke. And she, it's funny. I tease my wife. I think everyone's allowed to have one celebrity crush, right? She's totally my celebrity crush. Ever since 13 going on 30, I was like, she is the coolest ever. I'm a little nervous about what she can get out of me. So it all has to stay in the room. She was so amazing, not just from the point that I have a crush on her, right? Like just like insanely amazing. Give yourself room to not be a perfect parent, to not be a perfect, you know? But when you get the chance, be perfect. Ready for our black tie event? Already. Feeling good? I don't know. Looking good. Dang. I literally forgot my name tag. That surprised you. I forgot it. No. But you know what does surprise me? What's that? That we're not going to be late. We're going to be on time. Russell Brunson on time. It's really close. Unusual. Look at this guy. I hope you're chilling that around. You actually look a ton better than I do. So pretty. Alright, so what's happening right now, you guys? What about to do? We're about to go on a fun little yacht. Actually a little dingy. We'll call it a yacht. You excited for this? Yeah, I'm excited. Treasure moments that are special with your man. Most of the companies who were there had all raised money. I think there's probably half a dozen of us who were bootstrapped, entrepreneurs, and the rest were all like VC backed. And it was funny because I was talking with Dave about this ahead of time. I'm like, you know, in the bodybuilding world there's two competitions. There's one that's like the bodybuilding competition every comes and there's no rules, right? Like they never say like, oh yeah, go do steroids, but they don't test for it, right? And so because of that, that's what we get guys like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno and these dudes who are insane who are just like, you look at them, you're like, that can't be human. And you're like, oh, it's because they're not human. They're on steroids, right? So there's that term. But then there's the natural bodybuilding contest where you have to like, you have to like not be on steroids to qualify, right? And those guys look way smaller. Like they look amazing, but like you put them like standing next to each other. It's like, well, that dude's on steroids. There's the difference, right? I feel like the same thing here. Like the entrepreneur, the year award was like all these dudes who were on steroids, who took, you know, venture, cat, who got $2 billion in funding. And there's people like me who are the natural ones who showed up and like, you look at us by ourselves, look good, but you look stand next to somebody who received $2 billion in funding. It's like, how do you compete with that? Like it's just, it's, it's fascinating. All right. So we just got done with EY entrepreneur year award. Our battery's almost dead. So we didn't win, but we lost to that guy right there who started Groupon and this is his new company. So that's okay. And then in our category, we lost to Thomas Siebel who is Mark Benny Osseld boss. So we lost to a billionaire who's given 300 million to philanthropy. I can't say we're philanthropic. So we'll take the loss, but. So I lost to the billionaire, but the billionaire was all roided out. So I don't feel too bad because yeah. And then the usual one entrepreneur year overall of all the categories was the guy who started Groupon, which actually was really cool. Groupon is his sixth business and then took a public analysis, his new business, which I didn't get it. It was a confusing, but they went from zero to $2 billion valuation or excuse me, a billion dollar valuation in two years. Good morning. Good morning. We are packing up and heading out of this place, heading out of Paul Springs. So what's your favorite part about the week? Oh my gosh. Actually having my wife who is the favorite part, but it's life. Actually being here with Russell is a ton of fun too. Yes, I think so too. I didn't win the contest, right? And it's funny because some people reached out and they're like, oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. And like it's funny because like I didn't care. Like I wasn't going into it to do it. Like I'm always going into things looking for the story. Like what's the story I'm going to be able to tell because of this experience. I'm always talking about with you guys that you need to be building up your roll decks of stories. Like when I do a webinar, the reason I can do webinars so fast and I can crank them out, I can sell well because I've got this huge roll decks of stories I've been building up for over a decade. I can pull out really quick in a moment's notice, right? And so I'm like, what are the stories that I can pull out of this experience that I can use in other things, right? Like when I spoke at the 10X event and I did the $3.2 million in sales and everyone's like, oh my gosh, you made $3.2 million in sales. I'm like, yeah, that was cool. But I've got a story now and that story will make me 10 times that $3.2 million. If you'll tell a story about how I'm the highest paid public speaker in the world, how I net $1 million an hour, how all those things, I will sell way more product from that than I ever did from the money that I made at the event, right? I'm looking for the story. So for me, it's like this whole thing happened. I didn't win it, but for me, the story is this whole thing I was kind of sure at the end of the day, this natural versus unnatural. And I promise you, we're going to be building a bootstrapped entrepreneur of the year award and a thing and it's going to be a movement and a big thing based on this story, right? The fact that I lost, like I'm so grateful that I lost because now I have this story about, hey, I lost, but I was going up against people who run steroids. And so it's like, it's not really, it's like bringing a gun to a knife fight. Like let's come back and let's build the natural bodybuilding contest for entrepreneurs. Like now I have a story I can share and a reason and a purpose and I think it's going to call to all of my people, right? It's going to call out to the bootstrapped entrepreneurs, the people I love serving are going to hear that message and be like, yes, that's who I am, that's how, and they're going to hear my voice and they will come to me, right? And so that's the magic is like in the experience I'm looking for the story. Again, I respect the people who took on money who build these companies. Some are curing cancer, some of them are doing artificial and today amazing things. I'm grateful for them, but I want to celebrate entrepreneurs who didn't do it that way. Entrepreneurs who are bootstrapped, they have to figure this out on their own, they have to risk their own money, their own energy, their own time, like have you got all online because that's, those are the stories that really inspire me. If so, we're calling our shot. We're going to have the Bootstrapped Entrepreneur of the Year award called Shot. It's going to be amazing. So that said, we're going to go inside, get warm because Dave is freezing over here. We're at Coat, Boise, and 26 degrees out. See you guys next episode. you
