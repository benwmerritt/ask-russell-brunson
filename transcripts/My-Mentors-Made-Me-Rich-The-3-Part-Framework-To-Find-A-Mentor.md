Hey, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the channel. On today's video, I'm gonna be showing you guys a special presentation I did for my top level mastermind students, where we talked about how do you find a mentor? There's a lot of people who claim to be good mentors or people who wanna help you, but how do you find a mentor who's actually gonna get you to the finish line to get the result you're looking for? And Milwaukee is through three criteria points that are essential to make sure you're listening to the right people. And also on top that we're here inside of my brand new Napoleon Hill Room, where I'm surrounded by books from a whole bunch of my mentors, people who have passed on, who have literally changed my life. And so that's what the new scenery is here right here. With that said, I'm gonna load up the video. If you have any questions or comments, let me know down in the comments. I'll be checking those out. And also like and subscribe to get more videos just like this. With that said, here are the steps. Make sure you find the perfect mentor for you. One of my friends, Preston Eli, he wrote this blog post. This is probably 10 years ago. It's my favorite blog post on the entire internet. And it's the funniest thing ever. But he goes through like his routine, his daily routine, thing after thing after thing. And it's like intense, like second by second, like second number one, I wake up, second, I blink three times, second number one. He goes through this. It's like the most insane. And like, I literally, every time I read it, I send him on my, dude, this is literally the best blog post on the entire internet. And, but my favorite line is he goes through this whole thing about supplements he takes and all that kind of stuff. And then he stops for a second in this blog post. And he's like, you ask why? He's like, because Tony Robbins told me so. He says, I obey all giants with money, helicopters and stage presence. And actually Jenny, we need to make a t-shirt with this for this group. Like this would be insane. I obey all giants with money, helicopters and stage presence. Now for all of us, like this principle is key. And I'm not saying to blindly follow people, right? Not like just like everything I say, you shouldn't do it. Like I'm not saying that. But I am saying is that you need to do your due diligence to figure out who your guide is going to be. And when you find a guide who you believe with, you connect with the same values and things like that, then you've got to do this. You obey all giants with money, helicopters and stage presence. Okay, when I hire someone to be a coach, I spend a lot of time up front vetting them. Similar to your spouse, right? They always say like, when you're dating someone, you date with your eyes wide open and after you marry, you close your eyes down, right? That's how it works, I think. Same thing, like I'm going to go look at everything, make sure that my values aligned with the person I'm going to hire to be my guide or my coach, whatever it is. And after I've done that, boom, now I obey everything they say. That's the whole like hashtag do a Russell says thing came out of his brand and came in with the first really to blow up a company inside of our coaching platform and what we were doing. And they came back and that was what they did. Like whatever Russell says, we're just going to do it. And they just blindly followed everything I said because they had vetted me ahead of time. They decided that I was going to be their guide and then they put on the blinders and they just did it. Russell Brunton, we're having a moment, dude. So we're having a serious moment. They just got our dream home under contract. Love you, man. Hashtag do a Russell says. And so for me, I've always, when I'm going into something where I've picked something with definite a purpose, the first thing I'm trying to do is who's already been there. I do not want to troll blaze this thing on my own. Okay, I might not make it, but if I can find a guide and someone who's done it before, then it's not going to be that difficult, right? So who is the guide? A couple of things is number one, if I want to have someone to be a guide, that person has to actually have a strategy. They've got to have a framework. For example, how many of you guys love Gary Vaynerchuk? When I listen to Gary, the reason why is because Gary creates a certain belief pattern in my mind. I hear him talk about over and over and over again. Guess what Gary does not provide? A map. He doesn't have a framework. There's nothing. So like people will sit there and listen to Gary for the rest of their life and they're going to change their belief patterns, but they've got no map. They've got no guide. Dan Kennedy, I love Dan Kennedy. Dan Kennedy is really good at this, right? If you listen to his courses, it's like mind hacks. It's one of the greatest courses of all time. It's like 47 different mind hacks to do in your cells in your market. It's amazing, but there's no frameworks. It's like, here's a whole 47 cool things you can do. Like, whoa, this is amazing. But I don't know where to go now. So which one do I do first? I don't know. There's no path. Okay, so I love listening to other outside influences that are going to help shape my belief. I listen to Dan Kennedy all the time because I start thinking like Dan Kennedy. I listen to Tony Robbins all the time because I start thinking like Tony Robbins. I listen to Gary V because I start thinking like Gary V. So there's value in other people, but if they're not a guide, do not hire them to be your guide. Find somebody who has a proven step by step process. So I pick the mentor who's got an actual strategy I buy in and I have to look like I have to make sure that their strategy isn't just like, here's the overall strategy, but inside the strategy do they have tactics? Like step one, step two, step three, so I have a path I can actually follow. If they don't have these things, they can't be my guide. Okay, they can be an influence, but they're not going to be my guide. Otherwise, they'll be spinning in circles for the rest of your life. There are multiple ways to get to the end result, right? I don't have a monopoly on the only way to build a business, right? Like if you're end goal, the definite purpose, I want to make money. There's a lot of paths there. There's Russell's path, which is funnels. There's this one on eBay, there's Amazon. There's this, like there's a million different paths and the reality is most of the paths will actually get you there. That's what's crazy about it. You can do it. It doesn't really matter, but you got to pick one path. But the way you're not going to ever get there is if you got one foot on Russell's path and one foot over here on this path and you got an arm, it's like that twister game. You're like this. Like you're never going to get to the end ever, right? Because you got to make sure that you are picking on one. So you pick the path, put on blinders and do what that person says. Otherwise, you're going to be this and spinning and you're never actually going to get there. Okay? My biggest frustration, we used to have this, Mandy can remember this, we used to do these calls with the intercircle members back in the day, we called them decade and day calls where I had a 30 minute call with every single person. I can't tell you how many times people get to fight with me over something. But Sohnso said this, Well, Sohnso said that funnels don't work anymore. Sohnso said that, I'm like, Oh my gosh, like hire Sohnso then. Cause they apparently didn't know, like, but this way works for me. It's worked for like, I got tons of case studies I can show you what were 15, 16, 1700 people have hit two common couples. So like there's a process, there's a path that they're over and over and over and over again, like just focus on the thing you have right now. When you succeed on that, then do the next thing. This is one of the epiphanies I had this week where I was like freaking out. If you ever heard that phrase, people are like, you never want to meet your mentors. You never want to meet your heroes cause they're going to disappoint you. Like for example, Dan Kennedy, Dan Kennedy and I share a value. We both have value in marketing, right? We share that value. We're all passionate. And so I studied him, I loved it and everything. And I have a chance to meet him. What happens is you meet somebody and it's like, Oh my gosh, like I have this value that's the same. But these other values aren't in alignment. And we freak out like, Oh, I don't like this person anymore because our values aren't the same. And like it destroys relationship. Okay. It doesn't have to be that way. I can love Dan Kennedy because of the things we share, the value we share. He may not be able to have the same religious beliefs as me. He may have the same other beliefs in me. That's okay. Okay. If we think that the only people we can like are people have 100% same values as us, it's going to be very, very lonely, miserable life for you. In our church, there's a Joseph Smith, what's he called the Articles of Faith, the different Articles of Faith. And one of the Articles of Faith says, if there's anything virtuous, lovely, of good reporter praiseworthy, we seek after these things. In every relationship I'm with, when I have value that overlaps, I can find something virtuous, lovely, of good report inside of that thing. And I can love that person because of it. I don't have to be able to agree with everything to get value from the relationship. I want to stress that because if not, you're going to struggle. Some people in this room probably are like Russell, I don't align with some of these things. I don't believe in a God. I don't believe in it. It's like, that's okay. We share this common value. We're trying to change the world inside of our businesses. So like let's focus on that. So when I'm picking my mentor, I'm picking somebody who we have the same value, right? They've been where I'm trying to get to. And so I'm looking at this. The person I picked my mentor, what are their beliefs? What are their roles? What are their habits, routines? If I want to model people who are successful, and if I pick that person as my guide, I want to understand what they're doing, why they're doing it, how they're doing it. It's going to save me all the time and energy trying to figure these things out on my own.
