## Transcript
Alright, it is official and it is true. I have officially stepped down as the CEO of ClickFunnels. Kind of the back-store behind this. A lot of you guys saw our video that we filmed in Fiji with Tony Robbins and that was about a year ago and ClickFunnels has grown over the last seven years. We had some really high goals and we reached those goals, we shattered through them and I was kind of in a spot where I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. I didn't know what I wanted to do moving forward. I was stuck a lot in the administration side of the business, being the CEO, running things, meetings and all sorts of stuff which, if I'm honest, I'm an entrepreneur. That's not why I got into this business. I was spending like 5% of my time in creation and 95% in administration and I just wasn't happy. And so when I flew to Fiji, I was part of a mastermind group and I had the chance to ask Tony Robbins any question that I could dream of. You know, he had a chance to ask Tony who's been doing this for so long and seen everything. Like, what would you ask him? And so the question I finally asked him was, should I step down as CEO or should I keep running it? Like, I don't know what to do with my future and I was kind of stuck. I love the art of what I do and that's what I'm passionate about so I love it. It's like, it's all about that for me. As a business has grown, I'm still in the CEO role and I think that's been one of the hard things is that my ability to do the art has shrunk. Tony gave me some amazing advice and a big part of it was... I think the difference is the art matters to you emotionally. That's why I brought it up to you when I was talking up here. It matters to you so much. So you've got to decide, I can keep running it and I'll do my art and I'm going to hire someone to be the CEO and I'll be the chairman. That's what I would do. That's what I am in my company. I'm the chairman. I'm no longer the CEO. And now that it's been happening now for a little while, I can tell you it was probably one of the greatest decisions I've ever made. If you look at how ClickFunnels started, it wasn't like, you know, we had this big idea and we got a bunch of money and we hire a bunch of people. It was me and Todd in a room and Todd was coding and I was like the marketing guy and then we had this product and we started selling it. We started selling it and then I was doing customer support and he was doing customer support. You know, Todd and I kind of looked at each other and he's like, well, I'm running the product. You're in charge of the business. And so kind of by default, I had to pick up the hat of CEO and put it on. Even though I didn't really know what that meant. I'd never been a CEO. I didn't know what the CEO even did. I just knew that that was the role that I kind of grew into and was in charge of for the next few years inside of ClickFunnels. And the new CEO is Dave Woodward. They already knew that. So after the video and VG came out, I started like looking around like what should I do and who can I hand off all these responsibilities to? And Dave every day would come to my office like, how can I help you? What can I do to take things off your plate? And so I'd give him one thing and then the next and the next, the point where he was kind of running everything anyway. And I had a chance to start doing more of the things I like to do. The only person I really felt like I could trust to not only just run the company, but to really take my vision and run with it while he's taking care of the internal team and making everybody even better, which is awesome. I felt like I've been really good as a leader to our community, but I've never been a really good leader inside the company. Dave's taken those reins on. He's a numbers guy. He's spread his attribution and growth and all these amazing things that I should have been doing, but I don't understand. He's doing them now. Russell is the very best marker in the entire world. And the one part that you never really liked was the management side. I felt like I was really bad at it. So much stuff's happening. Internal culture is changing. Everything from ground has been rebuilt in a way that's going to serve you guys at an even higher level, which we're so excited for. Okay. So now you know who it is. Now I want to tell you why. Why did I decide to make this change? When we started this company, I was the person in charge of building funnels and the marketing and the brainstorming and the creative part of it. If I was to go get a job at a new company, I would apply to be the chief funnel builder. That's all I literally wanted to do. I remember I used to go into the office next to the guys in our team, the designers and the funnel builders. I would tell them, I'm so jealous. I wish I had your job. And they'd look at me like, seriously, why don't you just come do this? I'm like, I can't. I have to do all these other meetings and things. During this transition, I've had a chance to step back into that side of the business to be able to go and focus on the creative side of things. And so what that means is a couple of things. Number one, we have a lot of new updates and changes coming to click funnels. Todd's doubling down on the product side, which is amazing. And I have a chance now to double down on the education side. So you have a chance to see more education, more professional education, more videos like this. We're spending a lot more time and energy on our channels just to give people better insight and better understanding of how to be successful with the product. The second thing is I'm going to be actually building more funnels, which is exciting for me. I don't feel like my role is just to build funnels for fun. It's to build funnels to give you guys examples of things you can do inside of your business. You see me build a summit funnel or a challenge funnel or something like that. You have a chance to see them. They go, Oh my gosh, I could do that inside of my business. I want you guys funnel hacking. I want to create things that will give you guys the ability to grow your companies as well. Part of that is this content is going to be behind the scenes showing what we're doing and how we're doing it and why we're doing it. And hopefully it'll give you guys more insights on how to create better funnels to grow your companies as well. It's going to be nice also because in the last couple of years, I've had to shut down most of my coaching programs, my inner circle and things like that. And with making this transition, I'm going to have a chance to have more time to be working directly with you guys as a community. I'll be able to do more seminars and events and workshops and potentially reopening my inner circle and my mastermind groups. I just be able to chance to work with you, get my hands dirty again and really get back to the art. I want to give you one warning because as you start growing, like one thing that happens, a lot of you guys, you become the CEO and there's ego tied into that and there's status tied into that. In fact, my first hold, one person that I was going to be stepping down from CEO, like why would you do that? Like you're the number one person in the company right now. I was like, I don't care about that anymore. I just, I want my customers to be successful. That's the most important thing. If you are worried, like you can still be the founder, you can still be the chairman of the board, whatever it is that gives that ego, but doesn't necessarily mean you have to be the CEO unless you really want to. Okay. So with that said, the big question is what is changing? And the answer is nothing and everything. Okay. The product is going to be getting way better. We got some amazing things coming up. The training is going to get better. After more time to focus on you guys, that means the YouTube channel is going to be getting a lot of love, a lot of attention and maybe create some amazing things for you.
