This is what I'm really excited for, especially for the kids. I've been preaching to your parents for like a long, long time. So if they're not listening yet, your job as kids is to elbow them and be like, come on, let's go. And for the kids, I want you guys to set the example because some of you guys are going to kill it with this. It's really fun. It's time to start publishing your own shows. We're in such a unique, amazing time right now in the world. For all of you guys, where this phone right now is where everything's happening. I tell you what, like I remember the very first time I heard about podcasting was 10 years ago. And I was like, podcasting is for nerds. It took me a decade before I started podcasting. And looking back at it, if I had been podcasting for a decade prior to when I started, can you imagine what would have happened? Would have been different. I want to stress that like the opportunity is better now than ever. So that's the first thing. Okay. The second thing is like, why do you need a show? Well, I'd be like, well, I'm just going to buy ads. I don't need my own show. And I get that. But I want to stress why this is so important. And I think my favorite illustration of this is from this guy right here, our senior hall. There's this guy named our senior hall, like in the early eighties, he had a late night talk show for like five or six years. He was really popular. In fact, so much so that Bill Clinton, when he started running for president, he was an unknown candidate and nobody knew he had no shot of winning. Our senior hall booked him on the show. He came on the show and he played saxophone. And this whole young demographic were like, this dude who's playing saxophone on TV is running for president. And he swooped up all of the younger voters, all the age demographics started following and started loving him. And they said that was the swing in him becoming the president was being on the our senior hall show. The show was on for a long time. Eventually got canceled and nobody heard from our senior hall again for another decade or maybe longer until celebrity apprentice came on TV. And our senior hall is on there. I'm like, that's the dude that like, he's on the show. This is so cool. I'm watching him and he's going through the tasks. And one of the tasks, I think some guys are raising, you know, millions and millions of dollars for their charity and bringing things in and see our senior hall and couch calling the first person, calling the next, calling the next, calling the next. And nobody's answering his call. No, nobody's coming in. And when the whole task is over, they show everybody how much money they all made. Everybody made money except for one person, our senior hall. He got $0. And he's kind of frustrated. Man, he's like, when I had my own show, everybody returned my calls. Okay, this is why it's important for you. When you have your own show, you have a platform. You have a way to provide value to other people. And walk you through this because you guys got to figure out what your show is going to look like. Okay. Now, what's interesting is that all the online shows kind of mimic offline stuff. Okay, so Facebook has like, you can do Facebook lives, everyone Facebook page. It's very similar like a talk show. Okay, your own email list is like having a direct mail. A podcast is very similar to radio. YouTube is very similar to having a sitcom. Instagram is very similar to reality show. Blogs are very similar to newspaper. None of the media is new. It's just new how they kind of deliver it. So the first thing you guys have to think about is what kind of show fits you the best. Now, when I started doing my podcast, I knew it had to be something that I loved or I would never do. I would do it three times. I would stop. Okay, you have to pick something you're going to be consistent at doing because as you'll see here in a second, you have to publish at least 100 episodes before you're going to get a traction. So you got to do something you're so excited about that you can do more than just one. You would do it even if nobody was listening because at first nobody will be listening. What's up, everybody? This is Russell Brunson and welcome to the marketing secrets podcast. So for me, the podcast, I started podcasting and luckily for me, I didn't know how to track stats on a podcast. I just knew that if I did a podcast and I did it in my car every single day on my phone, I would be consistent. So I knew every day I'm in my car, I'm in my phone, click record on my phone, and I would drive and I would just talk. And I knew I could do it every single day because every single day I had to get in the car and it was consistent. Okay, you got to feel what's going to be consistent for you. Do you know what you're going to keep doing? Because you got to do a lot of it or you're not going to be consistent. One of the common things happens to everybody. It's wondering like, what gives me the authority to talk about this thing? I can't tell you sometimes I'm on a stage like this. And I'm like, why am I the one up here talking about this? The secret is you have to say one chapter ahead of the people that are following you. If I waited until I knew everything about marketing before I started talking about it, I still wouldn't be there. So what happened is I started learning stuff and I got excited. I'm like, oh my gosh, I started like talking about like, and I got right here and everybody started following me like freaking out too. And I'm like, I know this is amazing. I was just staying ahead of my, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. You don't have to be the best. You just have to be a chapter ahead of everybody else. That's the key. That's the secret. I guarantee you in a year from now, things will be different than today, but I didn't wait until a year from now to start talking about it. I started to do it today because here we are. The best time the plan of tree was 20 years ago and the second best time is right now. So step number three is you have to be consistent with this. You have to publish daily for at least a year or for at least a hundred episodes. When I met Stephen Larson and he first came into our office and we're talking about podcasting. I think at the time I was on episode like 300 of the podcast or something and he said something in passing. He was like, yeah, like the first like 40 or 50 episodes you did, like they weren't very good. I was like, oh, he's like, but then after that, like, like you got your voice and like start hitting it and they get better and better. Like, and every single one since it's gotten better and better and better. If I would have stopped at the very beginning cause I was bad, I never would have got to hear when the kids yesterday asking outside, I said, what was the thing? What was the big aha of where you went from me to shy, awkward, nerdy person that you guys saw on camera or on stage the very first time to be super comfortable on stage? Like there was never an aha. We just kept doing it and kept doing it and kept doing it and kept doing it. And in the process of you doing it is where you find your voice. Next question people always ask like, well, Russell, this is cool, but what do I talk about? I don't have a hundred things to talk about over the next, next hundred days or whatever, right? He said the big secret to creating content is documenting the journey. Today I went to the singing. This is what I learned. Oh, today I read this book. So I did this and you're sharing the story of the journey that you were going on to get that result. Right. I thought I'd be done teaching this stuff five or six years ago, but it's not. I'm still here. I'm still following up the mountain. Still going, still going, still going. Number two, this gives you the ability to start testing out different material. Have you ever, have you ever like seen a comedian who's on like late night TV and they stand up with a microphone and like every joke just slays it. People just go crazy. Everyone thinks like that person's naturally talented, but they don't understand what actually happened is that you rewind two or three years and the person's past and they were persons like, I want to be a standup comic. It's the sad job. They wrote 10 jokes. They went to the very first dive bar. They stood with a microphone and they slowly awkwardly delivered their 10 jokes. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And they said, you know, I delivered 10 jokes. Only one of the 10 jokes landed all the rest were just like, booed. It was horrible. Like, oh, so when back home, he kept kept the one joke that was awesome. They deleted the other nine and they wrote nine new jokes. Boom, boom, boom. So they do that over and over again. They do, they, they test it, find the truth, your new jokes, go back to drawing board. Come back again, do it, go back to drawing board three or four or five times. Eventually they have 10 jokes that they know are perfect. They know we're going to land. So they have a chance to stand up from the audience when they speak. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Everything hits, everything lands and they become the funniest person in the world. And that's the same way this works for you guys. You're doing these things to find out what are the things people listen to. Okay. When we were designing this entire event, guess what we looked at? What are all the things we talk about that land and the most of people, the things that connect the most? Like those are the things we're going to share. If you guys didn't care about something, like there's definitely things that even in this event as Joy and I, and I go through the, the workbooks, like that thing I talked about did not land. Like let's say they killed that. I got to teach it differently next time. And so publishing all these times gives you a chance to test your material and find out what things are the best. And when you find out those things, those are usually things like, okay, let's go deeper on, let's make a course on that or a product on that or whatever that, that thing might be. Okay. It's always fascinating what things people connect with, what things people don't. And this is an example of two different hooks I threw out. This is after Conor McGregor got tapped out by a wrestler. Which was awesome. Me and all my wrestling buddies were like, yeah, and I got 12 comments from my wrestling buddies and then it just stopped. I was like, dang, that hook was funny for me, but nobody else really cared. Then a couple of days later, I post this one. I said, this is my thoughts about the F word. I post this thing about how I don't believe you use the F word and how I think it hurts your message and help. And I kind of post that thing there. Anyway, it blew up. And I'm like, okay, that hook was good. People like that. But the more you're publishing stuff, the more you find out what did people resonate with? I got one more thing I want to share and then we're going to do a workshop here. This comes back to publishing consistently for a year, for two years, for five years, for the next decade. You know, a lot of times we think that a year's a long time, but a year goes so fast and 10 years goes even faster. Anyway, so Nathan Barry, he's the owner of ConvertKit, one of my competitors slash friends. Now he's awesome. He lives in Boise as well. He said this, it was endure long enough to get noticed. How many great TV shows have you discovered in season three or later? I started watching Game of Thrones after they had released five seasons, seasons. Pat Flynn had released over a hundred episodes of his podcast before I even knew it existed. I discovered hardcore history years after Dan Carlin started producing it. This is such a common experience. There's so much content to be produced that we can't possibly discover at all. So instead we wait for the best content to flow to the surface after time. If step one to building an audience is creating great content, step two is to endure long enough to get noticed. So for all of you guys who've committed in a year from now, if you do this, you publish a hundred episodes from now in a year from now, I promise you, you will be successful. You'll have people listening to you. Your voice will be heard. You will develop your voice to a point where people will care and it will change everything for you and for your business, but you have to be consistent.
