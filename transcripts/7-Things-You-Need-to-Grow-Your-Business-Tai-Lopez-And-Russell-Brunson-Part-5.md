## Transcript
Hey, this is Russell Brunson again, walking to part five of my exciting interview with Ty Lopez. If you missed any of the past episodes, go back in the playlist and make sure you watch all of them because this interview was really, really fun. It was exciting. It took place from 1 a.m. to like three or four in the morning. Some of the stuff we said is something that I wouldn't normally tell people in a normal audience, but because I was tired as I was tired, I was showing off, we could drop some really good value and some cool things I think you would love. So with that said, we're about to start the fifth episode. If you have not yet, make sure you subscribe down below. I know this is the last video in this series, but we got a whole bunch of other cool series coming out. I'll make sure you are not missing any of them. During this last of the series, we talked about a lot of really powerful things like proximity is power, how to build a team, how to surround yourself with the amazing people that help you get to where you want to get to. So if you're struggling at all and you're like, I know the people are doing it, but I haven't figured out how to do it yet, I think this interview is going to help you a ton. A lot of really cool things in here. So with that said, let's check out this video and afterwards I'll jump back on and kind of have some final words for you. I appreciate you watching this series and we'll talk to you after the interview. What is the one and only thing you must have in your business model to succeed? The foremost, most important technique in building the overall business model. Is it marketing, is it having, you got a good business partner, that I think is super important. In my opinion, business partner is huge. Man, there's so many important things. Good book on that called Working Together by Michael Eisner. You'd be surprised how many, what percentage, large percentage of billionaires had business partners. Whether it's number one guy for 18 years straight was not right now, but Bill Gates. He had Paul Allen and then he had Steve Ballmer. You have Warren Buffett who's been number two on and off. He had his Charlie Munger and you just go through the list and there's been people who did it without a partner, but the majority of people ever. So that's my answer, what's your answer? I think I'm gonna double on down on that. I think it's huge. I had a lot of businesses prior to ClickFunnels that marginally did well. It wasn't until we did ClickFunnels. And it was fun because when we built it, Todd, who's my co-founder, built the software, he was working with me, kind of as an employee. Not really, but kind of as an employee. And we had that for ClickFunnels. He's like, okay, I wanna do this, but I wanna be your partner. At first I had this fear of like, oh, but this is my business and my, it's always the kind of thing. Right. And luckily I'm so grateful that I was like, you know what, I'm gonna do it. And I opened it up and what's so cool is that he then went and took that and it became his business. So it wasn't like nine to five, it became his life. And then after we launched ClickFunnels, I'm starting adding people, instead of doing typical people doing like a higher bunch of employees, I think it was because Avengers had just come out and I love that movie. I was like, we need to build an Avenger team. Like we can, and I read an article, I wish I had kept it because it was so cool. They said that an A player is worth 3,200 times more than a B player. Yeah. That's 3,200 times. Think about a good programmer. Yeah, so I was like, let's just get a whole, let's say get a handful of A players and let's put them in like, that's gonna be what we do. Like your partner, he asked me, he's like, so how many developers work ClickFunnels? And I was like, and I was kind of nervous because he just told me it's the last company had a hundred or something developers. And I was like, we've got 12. He's like, what? There's only 12 developers in ClickFunnels. I'm like, yeah. He's like, how's that possible? I'm like, we only have A players. Like we literally, like that was the whole model. It was like, get the best in the world. And they can do, one good person can do the work of 10, 15, 20 other people. So that's how we've done things. And so with programmers, they say one good programmer is good 30 to 60. We have a drink game campaign coming on India Go Go. How about people who want to use Kickstarter, India Go Go to raise money, you worked anything and then ClickFunnels helped them at all on that. It does that's its own kind of funnel. Yes, I have been personally not, but I've seen some people do it where these ClickFunnels not sell the product, but for lead gen ahead of time. Okay. So they try to build up tons of pressure and excitement about their thing. So they thought and they'll take their Indiegogo video or their Kickstarter video and put it on a ClickFunnels page and just get opt-ins like pre-sell it. Yes. And then they had this huge list of big following and then when their thing goes live and they had this huge following, they can just push it right there and get a lot more traction off faster. So you can use it to generate free clients, free emails versus just paid. Be honest, you can use Shopify has some similar things. ClickFunnels, each of them have kind of their pros and cons. So when you are selling on Amazon, making a lot of money and honestly, let's talk about that for a second. So to be unbiased here, do you think there's a time when it makes sense to maybe be up on ClickFunnels and up on Amazon? Our biggest growth right now on ClickFunnels are Amazon sellers. Okay, so tell us how those work, how is that going? So a couple of reasons why. One is like some people get spooked because they lose an account or they know something or they lose an account. They're like Amazon shuts me down, like my business is gone, right? Yes. And so some people come because like I need to control my destiny and have two. And so that's a big reason why a lot of people do just be able to have two places they can sell it. Another big thing people do is a lot of times they're using Amazon to generate customers. And for example, we had a buddy who sells the cell phone cords, does like 100 grand a day in cell phone cord. What things? He gets them in China for like a penny. He sells them for like 20, 30 bucks. It's crazy. So the thing comes in the mail, penny, the box comes in the mail, you open it up, there's your cord and then there's a big card in the thing that says, hey, if you want a second cord for free, go to whatever.com, goes to that page, ClickFunnels page, you put in their shipping address, boom, now they got their customers contact info from Amazon over here. Now they're selling all the other stuff they sell. Power banks, they sell all the other, that type of products. So using, cause it's only a penny. Yeah, okay. And what did they get in? They tell them to, you get another cord, if you sign up to the email list or something. Yeah, you basically go to this page, fill out your address, the ship, your second cord for free. Let's talk about email for a second. Huge thing. What is ClickFunnels and what do you see the future of email marketing? I think in my business, I probably make, anywhere from 200,000 to a million dollars a month. Just having a good email list in just one of my businesses. Do you see in the same trend, email's still important, it's not completely replaced? I love email. I don't think it'll ever be completely replaced. What I'm finding fascinating is, we're doing a blend now of email and also like Facebook, Messenger messages. Yes. And it's, but like using both of them together has been really powerful. It's like you have a message here and then the Facebook thing that compliments it. Walk us through that for people who don't know. What are you saying? We all know, we've been to websites, put your email in and you get on some newsletter list. What are you doing with bot? When we hear the word bot, we talk about auto bots, we talk about transformers. We talk about auto inserting a message into their Facebook Messenger. Yes, so the way, so in ClickFunnels, we're finishing our platform that'll do bots and basically we're called, someone will fill in like, put their email address and they'll be able to button it and he says, you also want to send you this and follow through Messenger, right? They opt into both at once? Yes. So people check a box. Do most people check both? Yes, both. It's really high percent, yeah. So it's interesting, if you look at, so we have like over a million person email list and I think we have like 40,000 people on our Messenger list. And if we broadcast both of them, we get almost the same amount of clicks from, Really? From just 40,000. So if you had a million on the other one, it would be destroying. So we're putting a lot of effort and energy into the migration of people from here to here and getting in both places. Cause I also think it's also scary cause it's all on Facebook, all Messenger, Zuckerberg one day wakes up and he hates the size, he hates marketers. It's gone. So I'm not saying get rid of email, but I'm saying using both together and like that's, there's power in that. The more platforms you're on, the safer it is. What can an affiliate either to be an affiliate to ClickFunnels or to any product? How are they, what's your- Listen to me, how many of you guys want to be an affiliate and make Tyler Pesmore money and make you guys money in the interim? Do you guys have an affiliate program? It's like MentorBox. I say, I will. I don't know, that was my feet we earned in the venture. Okay, yeah. Does MentorBox have an affiliate program? MentorBox does. And so does TylerPes.com. Okay, so what would I do? This is what I talked about earlier. So I would go to YouTube and I would find all the coolest Tyler Pes videos you can find. There's a bunch of them, right? Find the ones that meant the most to you and probably like FEMA mouse, like here's all ties thoughts on cryptocurrency or all ties thoughts on whatever. Find the videos and then make a page that says, I'm gonna give you the top 10 Tyler Pes videos about cryptocurrencies. Put your email address in here and I will email you the top 10 videos I found. They're amazing. You're gonna learn about this, this, all that stuff, right? That's step one. So number two then. To get their email address. I go to Facebook yet and I target ties audience. My audience and entrepreneur audience and Mark Cuban's audiences and Tony Robbins audience and I say, come to TylerPes.com. You have TylerPes's 10 best videos on this topic and you spend a little bit of money. People come, they opt in. You start building email lists and then after them comes in, you email them. Here's the 10 links to the 10 videos. And then by the way, you know what, Ty, every single month curates. Him and his partner curate the best books they find and there's really cool thing called MentorBox. If you click on this link, you can account to MentorBox. Now you can get these videos. Now you're gonna get all their books, their best books every single month, blah, blah, blah, blah. And now they're affiliate for you and they've got a really unique offer they can go out there. The reason why affiliate's lose is because they'll go and the sign for your affiliate program, they'll get their affiliate link for MentorBox and they'll send the same link that everybody else on our sending. They want your product, it's not everyone's product and they can't be profit, because there's nothing unique about what they're doing. Yeah, you gotta make some content. So you take, and it's nice about it. Same thing, I tell my people, like, go to my channels. Put out every single day. Find the stuff you like the most, package it, give it away in an opt-in and then you build a list and then sell my stuff. Yeah. So let's talk about this for a second. Content. A lot of people are scared of creating a video. They don't wanna put their face on there. What do you say to somebody who has a false belief that they can't create something, some cool videos, cause they're introverted or they're nervous or what do you say? Probably two things, they can go to both directions. One is like, even introverted you can do. I'm actually super introverted. If you ask my friends at home, every time they see a Facebook Live, they're like, you talk a lot on the camera. You don't talk in real life. I'm super introverted. You can still do it. That's number one, don't be afraid. Second thing is though, maybe you really are and it's super huge fear. I look at my company, I got some amazing people who work with me, partners and founders and stuff, and they're not on video all the time, but I am. So it's like, if you can't be that person, find the partner who's like, they wanna do that thing, they wanna be the person in there and make that the partnership and that can work as well. Todd Dickerson would have, the code of ClickFunnels. Like he wouldn't have ever wanted to be on camera talking about ClickFunnels all day. That's like, I can't code, but I can do that. So we found each other and made it work. Most cases, introverts and extroverts are the best match. So if you're looking for a business partnership, if you can partner up, if you look at Warren Buffett, is extroverted. He likes to crack jokes. If you go to the Berkshire Hathaway, I mean he's funny and then Charlie Munger, he'll turn to Charlie Munger who's an introvert and be like, Charlie, what's your opinion? And he'll go, I have nothing to add. Your business partner's an introvert. My business partner, Alex, is visiting and guess where he has been all day? Locked in a guest room in my house. He's like, I'm working on something. Don't bother me with humans. That's a good partnership. Let's talk about copywriting, somebody's asking. How can people make their website the words matter? Like it needs to say something awesome. We created a software that helps that because the copyright is the hardest part. You build a page and they look really pretty, they look nice, but if people come and the words aren't right, no one's gonna buy it. That's what all comes down to. The funnel doesn't matter without the right words, the copy that converts people to buying. So I have a partner named Jim Edwards. He went through all marketing advertising for the last 100 plus years and found all the best converting headlines from all the way back from the beginning of Copyright, like Gene Schwartz and Gary Halber, all these people and combined all these things, put in software. Basically you could type in your product name, it's like, I sell this, this is one of the benefits, this is the feature that you talk about, you fill in some blanks, you click a button and it pops out like 800 headlines based on the best headline templates in the world. And you can copy it, you look them all. It's called Funnel Scripts. Funnelscripts.com. I have a bunch of friends who are high-paid copywriters who charge anywhere from 15 to 25,000 dollars a letter. And they used to go and they'd give a client, huge client questionnaire, they'd fill in the whole thing and they'd go and spend the next six weeks writing copy. Now what they do is they take a client questionnaire, they fill in the funnel scripts, they click the button and it pops out the copy and they tweak it a little bit and they send it to the client, start the same fees. It gets, it's legitimate. If you don't know how to write, yeah, here's the thing. There's a catch for what I need to do. If you don't know how to write, most people don't know how to write. You're not gonna make a lot of money. One of the best things they should have taught us in school is copyright, how to be persuasive. So what's some copywriting simple thing? There's my simple thing. A lot of you guys need to fix your website. If you're a physical location, put the hours, put the buy button high, you know, something. I remember one time I couldn't buy something. I was a website, I wanted to buy something. I searched, I actually sent it to my assistant. Can you find how to buy? I honestly think they forgot. I want to give you money. No, I think they forgot to put the buy button up. They were, it was like long and they had written in, they forgot to buy. So what's, my technique is keep it simple, stupid. Find out what people want on your website. Hit them with power words. The most powerful word in the English language they say, according to Frank Luntz, he's a famous political consultant. He says the word imagine, it's a power word. Imagine if you lost 50 pounds in the next 50 days. Imagine, you know, people like to, especially in America. So that's my quick hack. What's a hack for you to be simple thing? Besides using this website. My favorite headline in the world, or almost everything is how to blink without blanks. It's how to, and then you insert like, the thing they desire the most. Yes. The thing that causes them the most pain. So for example, I could be like, how to read all these books without actually ever reading a book. And then I'd like give you money because I want to watch the videos and get the whole download, right? Yep. Because like every, every market, I always start with that. It's like, okay, what do people actually want? Like, so how to, and insert what they desire the most without the thing that they're most scared of. I have a course where I've taught over 20,000 people how to build a social media marketing agency. So they're offering social media to, to any clients. To businesses. They go around to businesses, they charge one to $10,000 a month. How do they get customers using your techniques? So if I was going to a business owner, and I was like, what do they desire most? They want customers coming in their place, right? So how to get, how to get- Doctors, let's say doctors and dentists. They're gonna specialize, or in restaurants. Okay. So let's, okay, let's use dentists then. So how to get, how to get cash paying clients to come into your clinic, they call clinics, the dentistry. Dentists office. Without having to, or how to get, how to get, yeah, how to get cash, whatever, whatever their thing is, right? The paying clients. Paying clients. And then I don't think most dentists want to sit there on social media. So without spending time on Twitter, Instagram, or Snapchat. Okay. Because they want to fix people's seat. They don't want to be doing these things, right? Yes. If you have a social media marketing agency, you make up, click on the landing page. The landing page at the top says how to get, so if it's a dentist, how to get 17 new dental clients this year from social media, and then you put, without having to ever log into Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. That's a great headline actually. You like that one? Right there. Take that. You should use that. If you don't use it, then you hate money. That's the only reason we're doing it. You hate money? I gotta use that. I can't lie on people. I can't lie on people. Yeah. So they build it on click funnels. They get the headlines up. How would you get dentists to start going to see this page? I would go to Facebook and target dentists. Pretty easy. That'd be the first spot. Another thing, I know a little bit about the dental market. If I was going after dentists, I'd go to dentaltown.com. dentaltown.com has an email list of like 80,000 dentists. You can rent for like five grand. Really? I'd add, I'd pay them down, I'd have a whole bunch of clients overnight. So you can basically rent email lists. They call it email drops. You can do an email drop to 80,000 dentists. And you have them click. And most industries have those kind of things. You guys have to know dentaltown.com does it for dentists, but most of them have those type of things where people have aggregated the industry and you can rent ads to go out in their email box.
