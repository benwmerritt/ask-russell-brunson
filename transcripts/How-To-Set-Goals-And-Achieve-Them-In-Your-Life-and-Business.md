Those is tuning in, my name is Russell Brunson, and right now we're answering a whole bunch of the top marketing, sales, funnel building, traffic generating, cash producing questions you guys are asking, and today's question is about goal setting. So how do I effectively set goals for my life and also for my business? And so this is a great question, and I actually learned a lot of my goal setting principles from one of my buddies, Alex Sharfin, and it's funny because he taught them to me in the business context, and then since then I started using them with my family. If you guys know much about me, but I have a beautiful wife and five kids, I was like, how do I set these things for their goals for our family as well? I think a lot of times the problem with us entrepreneurs is we get excited, so our goal is like, I wanna make a bunch of money, and then we're like, whoa, we're running around, and then a lot of times nothing ever happens, and we're running, and we run out of runway really quick, or we just don't have a good vision of everything we want. And so as you start actually building a company, you start trying to grow a team, you start trying to do something amazing, you start looking at things differently. So what Alex taught me, and that we're doing really well as a family, and we're incorporating now more and more here in our company inside ClickFunnels, is a couple of things. So Alex talked about it, if you look at a traditional, here's a football player, right? In fact, let's just say, that nose is horrible, there we go, there's a football player, this is a coach, here's the whistle, so you can see he's the coach. Okay, so let's say it's Vincent Bardi, so the first day of Vincent Bardi has a meeting, what does he say, the very first area of football season, right? Gentlemen, this is the football, right? Now he's got his team, here's all the players down here, he's like, I gotta get these players to help me win a Super Bowl, okay? So the first thing they set as a team is what they call a Hall of Fame goal. So what is your Hall of Fame goal? As a football player, they all wanna be in the Hall of Fame, right, so it's easy, they wanna be in the Hall of Fame. Hall of Fame, okay? So if you have my questions, what's your Hall of Fame goal? Okay, if you do this for your business, what's your Hall of Game goal for your business? If you do this for your family, what's your Hall of Game goal for your family? I stand with my wife, my kids, and I ask them this, what's your Hall of Fame as a family? Like, in 10 years now, 20 years now, how do we know we succeeded? Like, what is it that looks like? And so we developed a Hall of Fame goal as a family. Then here's a company, like, what's our Hall of Fame goal? Here's ClickFunnels, okay? So now we know like, this is where we're trying to go long term. Then we gotta step back, say, cool, cool, that's where I go long term. Number two then, what is our Super Bowl goal? Okay, for football players, it's easy, like, we wanna win the Super Bowl, right? They all have that, so that's the goal. Okay, so now we look at this, okay, what's your Super Bowl goal? And the next 12 months, what do you wanna accomplish? Okay, and one of the big mistakes, and I'm as guilty as this is everybody else's, we set these goals, like, I'm gonna make a billion dollars, and it's like, the problem with that is, if you don't hit it, then everybody fails, right? Like, and so we wanna set realistic goals, we wanna set goals that stretch you pretty far, but you also wanna make them like, like realistic, we could actually, it's possible you could potentially actually hit those things, right? So your team's like, yes, I'm gonna go, we're gonna go for the Super Bowl. So you set a Super Bowl goal, okay? Now you got that, now it's like, okay, for this team, like, if they wanna win the Super Bowl, what do they need to do this month at practice, okay? And this season, so then, yeah, because this is like the season, right? So then you come down, you're like, okay, we're gonna do this month, then we're gonna gotta do this week, and then what do we gotta do each day? Day. And so for you, if you're setting goals, it's the same thing, okay? With my family, what we did is, we set our Hall of Fame goal, then we set our Super Bowl goal, then we said, okay, to hit our Super Bowl goal, what do we gotta do this month? Then we broke down, what do we gotta do this week, then we're gonna do each day. And then, me and my kids and everyone, we use Trello, we have a little checklist, my kids know every single day I gotta do these things, and they do all those things every single day, then at the end of the day, they get a reward, okay? And then we have our weekly goals, okay? Each week, we gotta do all these things, and one of them is do the daily task list for entire week, right? And then we have a couple other weekly goals, then we have our monthly goals, and then we have the Super Bowl goal, right? So now every day, we're coming in, we know exactly what we gotta do, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Then every week, we're gonna do this week, boom, boom, boom, every month, and then boom, boom, and it moves you towards the goal, okay? And so that's how I do my goal setting here, as a family, also in a company, but any entrepreneur, again, the biggest problem we have is all that most of us see the Hall of Fame goal, I'm like, oh, I want that, and then we start running. We have no idea where we're going. You have to understand, you have to reverse engineer that to like, okay, cool, that's awesome, but what's this, what's this, what's this, and what's this, because this is what you're doing day by day. And sometimes people struggle, because they don't have a Hall of Fame, they don't know where they're going either, and they just have these daily task lists, and they're going through tasks, you know, to-do lists like crazy, and that's also tough as well, because in fact, I bet if I was to ask you guys, like, hey, where do you wanna be in 10 years from now? For most of you, let's say, let me draw this a little differently so you can kind of see it, but if I said, where are you gonna be in 10 years from now? You'd be like, okay, here's me today, here's me 10 years from now, and I'll have you explain it, and you're like, I'm gonna be doing this, and this, and this, and you have a whole list of all the stuff you're gonna be doing, right? And I'm like, cool, what's your to-do list today? And you're like, here's my list of stuff I gotta do today. And I'm like, okay, does anything on this list here have anything to do with this right here? And 99% of you guys would be like, there's not a single thing on today's to-do list that gets me even a step closer to that. Yet that's what we're doing every single day, right? And next day, we got our new list, then we got our new list, we got our things we're doing, but we never actually are focused on things that get us to that, okay? But going through this process of like, okay, here's our hall of fame, boom, now let's backstep this, okay, what's our Super Bowl, boom, now let's backstep it, what's our monthly, what's our weekly, what's our daily? Now, everything you do in here is moving towards here, so we're moving towards here, which moves you towards here, which gets you to there. And that's how we do goal planning, and goal setting here in our company. And with my family, I hope that helps any of you guys who are trying to figure out how in the world to set your goals, so you can actually achieve them, both in your life and in your business.
