## Transcript
Hey, what's up? Great to see you again. Today, I want to talk to you about something that I think is going to help you a lot. I'm going to show you guys how in the next 30 days how to get your first thousand leads and then turn that into your first thousand dollars. If somebody has me aggressive and you're going to go and try to get 10,000 leads and 10,000, you know, if you want, I don't really care, but I'm walking through a process that's improving to work over and over and over again. It's something we teach in our highest level coaching programs to people to actually launch their project, launch their Webinar or launch. Whatever it is they're trying to sell, it's a really simple process. I think if you follow it, it's going to be really effective for you. So that's kind of game plan we're going to cover during today's video. So if you want a thousand leads and you want to turn those leads into a thousand dollars in the next 30 days, that's what this is all about. We'll walk you through it step by step, day by day process. Also, as I'm going through this presentation down below, as you have a ha moments and ideas that come to your head, please post them down below. The more a ha's I see, the more excited I'm going to get about making you more videos. So post all the a ha's down below. And also, if you want to click on the like button, I would mean the world to me. I'm not going to lie. My love language is physical touch. And since I can't give you a physical hug right here, my second love language is words of affirmation. So anything you put down in the comments down below will mean the world to me. So with that said, let's jump right in. Now again, the format I'm going to show you guys will take about 60 minutes a day if you do it consistently. So if you block out one hour a day for the next 30 days, that's the goal. So some of you guys, that means getting up an hour earlier than you're used to. Some of you guys, that means getting up an hour or staying up an hour later. Maybe it's during lunch hour, but you have to carve out about 60 minutes a day to change your life forever. Is it worth just taking 60 minutes? I think it should be. So that's kind of game plan. 60 minutes a day, who's going to take? All right, day number one. The first question I want you to ask yourself is who is the person you actually want to serve? And I always start any training with this because what a lot of people do is start creating something because they're excited about creating the thing and then because they create something that attracts the wrong customer, they end up in a business that they hate because they have the wrong customers. In fact, if you've ever read my book dot com secrets, literally chapter one, I talk about this. Like I had been building a business. I had a whole bunch of customers and I woke up one day so miserable because I didn't love my customers. I remember laying in bed thinking, I wish that I had a boss that could fire me, but this is my own company, so I have to go in. It was a little while after I remember sitting down and thinking, okay, how do I get to a spot where I'm excited to go to work every day? I'm excited to create. And it was shifting who my dream customer was. And so I identified this is who my dream customer is going to be. So my question for you, number one is like, who do you actually want to serve? Who's the person that you would serve them anyway for free because you love it. You love them. You're excited about the topic. If you can figure what that is, it'll change the dynamics of everything. If you're trying to like pull teeth to go and like make money, this is a miserable job and you should go find something else to do. But if you want to serve people and you're excited about those people that you're serving, this becomes really fun. Now, partially this is important because the first two weeks or so, we're going to be serving those people. We're not going to be getting money initially. We're going to be serving, serving, serving, providing value, doing those kind of things. And by doing that, people are going to start getting magnetically drawn towards you, which will set up the last two weeks, which will give us to the thousand dollars from the thousand leads. So that's going to get planned. So step one is that a lot of times people ask me, who should I serve? And the reality is for most of you guys, it's you five years ago. If you look in this little image here, there's growth and contribution. Like you've been growing over the last five years. You've become something special. Like who have you become? So think about who are you five years ago? Like those are the people you're going to go and contribute to now with the knowledge, information, the things that you've learned in the last five years as you've gone on this journey to become something amazing. So day number one is who is the person that you want to serve? All right, that moves us over to day number two. Now, we know who that person is. We got to figure out what is going to be the lead magnet or the bait that's going to get that person to come into my world. Right? So we got to create something. Dan Kennedy, he coined the phrase lead magnet and lead magnet can be simple. Back in the day, people thought like lead math has to be a book or has to be this huge thing and they've stressed about how much effort would go into it. But the example right here, this lead magnet, this is one of Brendan Bouchard's lead magnets. It's called the one day productivity planner. It's one piece of paper. Okay. And he's built the list of millions of people by giving away a one page productivity planner. So it can be simple. Right? Nowadays with AI, like it's almost too simple. You can create lead magnets and very, very simple. Just like, hey, I'm looking for blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. All right. Aschat, GBT or whoever and they can pop out and you can create a really simple lead magnet. The key is just making something really sexy that somebody is going to want because you're going to be trading them this lead magnet information in exchange for their email address. So it's got to be good enough that they're going to give you the real email address. Okay. You make something crappy or something that's not that cool. No one's going to give it to you. So I think what is the thing that me five years ago would have given my email address, would have went and tried to find out, you know, the bar is in his credit card to buy like, what's something so good I can give away for free. And that becomes the lead magnet to get your dream customers to come to you and give you their email address. Okay. So that's, that's what's going to be happening on day number two is actually creating that lead magnet. And like I said, you can use AI to help, but I wouldn't use it completely because AI, as of today, as I'm making this video, the content comes out. Okay. So make sure you go in there and add your own stuff. You want to add a video or add, you know, things just to make it unique to you. Be sure to do that. But the power again is to creating a really powerful lead magnet. For example, Brendan's, which is so funny is the one page productivity planner. And then what we're going to do is then we're going to be putting it on a landing page like this and basically says, Hey, if you want this free lead magnet, give me your email address in exchange. You can see right here, it says free download, the one page productivity planner used by CEOs and achievers worldwide. And then they opt in, they give you the email address in exchange for this lead magnet. All right. So that brings us to day number three, which is actually creating the lead funnel. Okay. The lead funnel is the most simple type of funnel. There's two pages. There's page number one says this is the lead magnet you're going to get. And the page number two is where you actually give them the lead magnet. It's pretty simple, right? It's two pages. This is what one looks like. This is like one of the most simple ones. This is the going pro manifesto. That was the name of the lead magnet that Brian Moran created. And again, if you look at this, it's very simple. Page number one, there it is. Here's the lead magnet. Give me an email address, page number two, give me the download. You create a lead funnel like this in about three minutes. Since I click funnels, it's one of the easiest funnels we have. In fact, down below in the comments, we'll put some swipe files for some lead funnels you can use. Click on the link and it'll literally take that and install inside your click funnel account. If you don't have a click funnel account, it'll give you a free trial. So I'll put it down. A whole bunch of really cool lead funnels down below you can use. And then from there, you just basically plug your lead magnet into it. And that way, now when you request your lead magnet, they will be put on your email list. And that's the big secret, getting the leads. Okay. Now, some of you guys are wondering like, Russell, why are like, why are we getting the email address? Like, what's the big deal? Especially my kids, I tell them about the stuff my kids like, God, no one reads email anymore. And they're like, it's all in Snapchat or Instagram or whatever, right? And that may be true in the next decade. People would tell me now for almost 20 years, the email is dead. I'm 20 years into it. My email list is like five or six million people large and it still makes me money every single day. So building an email list is still the most important like foundational element you need to be doing inside your business. And the easiest way to do that is by giving away lead magnet, right? So they come in here and what I want you to understand is this concept that the money is in the list. I remember people used to tell me that back when I got started, like, the money's in the list, the money's in the list. I didn't understand like, how is the money in the list? I didn't, it didn't make sense to me. And I remember I actually found an article from somebody, again, this is man almost 20 years ago, I was in college at the time, and it was explaining how email marketing works. And he says, you've probably seen people online bragging about, oh, I made $30,000 an hour, I made six figures in a week. And in your mind, logically, that makes no logical sense. That's not possible. And the guy in this article explained to me, no, this is how it actually works. He says, you know, all these different gurus who are talking about it, he said they have an email list of 10,000 or 30,000 or 100,000 people, right? So when they create a new product, a new offer, they put it out there and they send an email to a list of 30,000 people, right? And obviously 30,000 people aren't going to buy it, but if you get 30,000 people, you send the email to, from there, you get 10,000 people to open the email. By the way, this is what a funnel looks like if you hear me talk about funnels, right? 30,000 people get the email, 10,000 open, from that, 5,000 click on the link, you know, from there, 5,000 go to the page and from there, maybe 1,000 click on the order form, 300 actually buy the product and boom. And 300 people buying a $100 product, boom, you just made, what's the math, not $30,000, right? And he's like, that's how the gurus make their money. They focus on building a big list and then they create offers to sell to that list. And when I heard that, I was like, oh my gosh, that makes so much sense. And so for me, my focus began like 20 years ago, like how do I build a list? How do I build a list? Like let me focus on that. At the time, it was funny, I'd bought some real estate and I had this house we bought, we bought like $150,000. We had a rehab it, we got a renter in there. And when all of a sudden then it was cash flowing like 200 bucks a month, you know, and this is how everyone's telling me to get rich. And I was like, this is so much work to do this, right? While I was doing this whole real estate thing, I'm like, cash flowing 200 bucks a month. This is so stressful, cost me $150,000 up front to buy this thing. That's what I learned about email marketing. And I'm going to finish this story after I show you what somebody showed me. They talked about the money in the list. And my friend told me this, he said, you should be able to average $1 per month per name on your email list. Okay? So again, $1 per month per name on your email list, which means if you have a thousand people on your list, you should make a thousand dollars a month. If you have $10,000 a list, you should be making $10,000 a month. You have $100,000 a list, $100,000 a month, so on and so forth, right? So my friend told me that. I was like, is that true? He's like, so far, those are numbers in my business. And I was like, okay, I'm going to try this out. So I started building a list. I remember I was doing all sorts of stuff. Some of the stuff I'll show you guys today. I started building the list though. And from that, a month and a half ago, I got 217 people who joined my list. And sure enough, that first month, I made about $300. This is while I was in college. So I'm kind of freaking out. I was like, I got this list for free. Didn't cost me any money to build the list of 270 people, whatever it was, right? 217 people. It didn't cost me money to build that list, but it made $300. I'm like, I spent $150,000 on this duplex and I only made $200, right? And I was like, this is such a better way. I don't have to go and spend a ton of money. You can go and buy money and spend ads to build your list, which is a great strategy. Not what I'm going to be showing you guys today, but it just changed my whole perspective. I'm like, I'd rather invest in building a list and invest in the house because this now, I can make money every single month from that email list. Does that make sense? Okay, so that's why the money's the list. That's why it's so important. All right, this is what Brandon Bouchard's Leave Funnel looks like. Again, landing page. He asks for email address in exchange for the one-page productivity planner. Thank You page. He has a video explaining it and gives him down the link to it. Okay, this is one of my Leave Funnels. This one right here, this page is very simple. There's an e-cover of the lead magnet and then asked for the email address. This page right now gets 58% opt-in rate and so far has generated me 185,136 leads. So I don't know about you, but if you do the math on that $1 per month per lead, this has been one of the most profitable properties in the world. Let's like buying a condo in Manhattan and renting it at top market dollar every single day. I got that by making a simple two-page funnel. Squeeze page, thank you page. That's it. Day number four. So right now, we know our dream customer is, we've created a lead magnet, created a lead funnel, started getting those people to give us their email address. Now it's all about getting people to come to you and give you their email address in exchange for your lead magnet. That's the next step. Okay, you guys want to see how this works? All right, so day number four. I'm calling this a social media reset. Okay, because I want you to shift your mind. For most of you guys right now, you're probably a consumer of social media. All right, because right now you are literally consuming this video. Okay, a consumer is on their phone and they're consuming videos, consuming videos and reels and shorts. They're like, they're consuming social media, right? If you want to start being successful, we transition away from being a consumer of social media and become a producer of social media. Right now, what am I doing? I'm producing social media. From this video, I'll probably add 10,000 people to my list or more, hopefully. That's the goal, right? We're shifting from being a consumer of social media to a producer. And this example, I'm going to show you this Facebook, but you can do the same thing in other platforms. But let's talk about Facebook. So in Facebook, I'm going to do first off, then I go to my personal profile. Now your personal profile is no longer for your mom and your grandma and your friends to come see who you are. Okay, this is now a business you are running, right? So I'm going to change my social media profile. I'm going to change Facebook so that my cover photo explains what I actually do, right? So check this example, Megan Taylor. It says, social media mastery summit. Sign up for three clients in just three days. This must tend event, blah, blah, blah. Right? So she has information in her header on Facebook about what her lead magnet is. Okay? That's number one. Number two, the very first post you make is going to be giving away your lead magnet. Okay? The reason why, when somebody comes and click on your profile, they show up and say, oh, what does this person do? The header graphic tells you what you do. And the very first post is like, hey, give me your email address in exchange for this cool thing. They click on the link inside the first post and it takes them over to your lead magnet. And now they start joining your list. So we're structuring things to start getting people from the internet to give you the email address. Okay? That makes sense. Change the cover on your Facebook profile and then make a post that's giving away your lead magnet. It's linking out to your click funnels funnel. Day number four. The next thing we're going to do is we're going to go into Facebook and we're going to join between five and 10 groups. Okay? Now, the coolest thing about Facebook is Facebook has already congregated all these people together for you based on the things that they're interested in, right? So in this example right here, I typed in the word photographers in Facebook and Facebook has all the different groups. If you look at the groups here, there's a whole bunch of different ones, right? The first one's got 11,000 members. Second one's got 11,000 members. Third one's got 49,000 members. Next one's 96,000 members. Next one's got 215,000 members. Okay? So if I'm a photographer, where am I going to find other photographers who are going to want my lead magnet? They're already on Facebook and Facebook already put them together in a group. So I would do this. Okay? I'm going to join five to 10 groups on photography or figure out what you're about, right? Maybe you're into stock trading. I'm going to go to Facebook type in stock trading, stock markets, whatever, and try to find a whole bunch of groups of people talking about stock trading, right? Or again, whatever it's cooking or fishing or whatever your market is, whatever your dream customers, we're going to find out where they're congregating in Facebook groups. Okay? This is the strategy. So type in photographers, find all these things. I'm going to go, I'm going to join this group with 49,000 members, the group with 96,000, group with 215,000, I'm going to join between five and 10. My goal is to get groups to have at least 100,000 people. So in the meetings, if I have, if I join 10 groups, they each have 100,000 people, now I'm in, in ponds of my dream customers over a million of them, right? On Facebook right now. Okay? Now again, my goal right now in the next 30 days is not to get a million people. This is fun, right? There's a million people in these Facebook groups. My goal is to try to get 1,000 of them to join my list. And then from those thousand, I'm sure I turned those thousand people into $1,000 in the first 30 days. Sound good? Okay. So we join these groups. Now, what you don't want to do when you join the groups is what some people do. And they jump in like, hey, I'm so excited to be in your group. Yeah, download my free lead magnet here. Okay? That's called spamming. Nobody likes to spam. It's like going to a party and you walk in, right? All these people talking and hanging out. You jump in really quick and you're like, hey, everybody, I want to sell you something, right? That's not how it works. Instead of what we do is we come in these groups and we start building relationships, start getting to know people. Okay? That's how this is going to work. All right? So day number four, the next thing we're going to be doing is we're going to be providing value. This means I'm going to make one value post and I'm going to get to answer three questions per group. Okay? So for example, let's say you are in the how to make money on the internet market. I've got a group, the ClickFunnels group has over 225,000 members in here, right? So if you join this group and if you went spam, we kick out instantly, we blacklist you, everyone will make fun of you. So don't do that. Instead, we usually come to this group and we do two things each day. We make one value post and then we go find other people who are asking questions and try to answer those questions. Okay? One value post, three questions per group. So if you're in 10 group, it means you're going to be doing 10 value posts. You can use the same value post in each group. That's fine. Then you're going to answer three questions in each group. Okay? So for example, here in the image, this is one of my friends, they went into our group, they posted this value post. It was amazing. It said, top 10 hooks to track the dream social media clients and had 10 hooks. I popped them out, posted it, right? Great value and not selling a thing, not pitching anything, just posted that in there. And in from this one thing, she got like 50 or 60 comments people like, that was awesome. Thank you so much. Oh, so grateful. Right? All these people are seeing like this person's very useful. Right? Next stage came back, posted again. This time it was top five objections you'll hear as a social media manager. Boom, boom, boom. Posted those in there. Next time 150, 200 people like, this is amazing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All sorts of good feedback. Now, what happens when you're in a group and someone shows up and they start providing value and they've read value the next day and they're answering questions like, who is this person? They're so cool. Right? I say, having a party and some person comes in and they're in there connecting and hanging out. They're the cool kid in the group. You're like, this person's awesome. I want to find out their name. This is what starts happening. You're in these groups, you're posting, you're providing value. Again, one value post per day, three questions answered per group. All of a sudden, these people start seeing you like, who is this person? They click on your name, comes over to your Facebook profile. Very top. They see the banner out of what you do. They see the very first post, which is you promoting your lead magnet. Then they click on that and boom. A million people inside the groups. You know, from there you get 100,000 people that see your posts. From there you get 10,000 who click on the link. From there you get 1000 people who start joining your email list. You guys getting this? This is all free traffic. Russell, this is a good theory, but it didn't work for you. Literally, this is how I built my business. I built my business 20 years ago before we had Facebook, Instagram, YouTube. Before Myspace. You guys remember Myspace? Before Myspace, there was a thing called Friendster. I tried to use Friendster, but Friendster, you couldn't buy ads on it. This is when I got started in this game. What I would do back in the day, this exact same strategy. I went to forums. This is before Facebook was down. They had forums. You joined a forum. They have 300,000 members and guess what I would do? I had 10 forums I was a member of. Every single day I went and made a value post in all 10 of these different forums. I went there and answered questions every single day. From that I built my list from zero to over 10,000 people in the first 90 days. That was the big secret. You didn't spend a single ad, not a single dollar. What I'm telling you now is the exact same thing that I did to grow my list initially. Only Facebook makes it so much easier because you don't have to go find the forums online. Just go to Facebook and all the groups are already there. They're already active. You see exactly how many members are in there and you go participate really quickly. Again, come back here. One value post, three questions per day. From there they see your profile. They click on it. They end up going back here to your Facebook page. They see your banner ad. They see your very first post and from there, boom, they click on it. They go into your ClickFunnels account. They put their name, email address in it. Now they are a lead and now you are in business. Now you got people who have joined your list. That's day number four. Now between day five and 14, guess what we're going to do? We're going to be awesome. We're not going to sell you guys anything. We're going to continue to provide value for two full weeks. Day five, day 14, one value post per group. Answer three questions per group and consistency is the key. Do not sell anything. Just be awesome. Provide value. Show people how much you know, how much you care and by doing that, every single day you're going to watch your list go from five people on your list to 10, to 25, to 50, to 55, to 100, to 400, to 500, to 1,000. The goal is in those first 14 days to get from a million people in the groups to 1,000 people who are on your email list. Now obviously for some people, they get less than that. Some people get a lot more than that. It all depends on how much value you provide, how often you're in there. But again, the key is understanding that you're not getting drowned in these 10 groups. We're not consuming social media. We're producing it. We're coming here giving answers, providing value. That's how people start finding out who you are and start joining your list. All right, so here we are right now. Week number one, we've been focusing on list building. Week number two, we've been focusing on list building. I want to note that this process doesn't stop. You don't just do list building for two weeks. You're like, I'm done now. You just start selling stuff all day long. Continually do list building. I'm in business now 22 years. And guess what? I still focus on every single day. List building, okay? You never want it to die. It is like the lifeblood of every single business. Whenever a company comes to mind and they're failing, they're struggling, I look at them. What normally has happened is they stopped driving traffic into their business. They stopped bringing in new leads. They have their existing customers that keep selling these people over and over and over again. But over time, there's attrition. It gets smaller and smaller. They're like, my business is collapsed. I can't figure out what's going wrong. I'm like, how many leads do you generate today? We're not focusing on the lead generation. We're selling to our existing audience. That's the big problem, okay? So, week one, week two has been all list building. Continue to do these processes. Don't stop doing it. You block out an hour a day. You can do these value posts, answer the questions, and keep doing that. Your list will keep growing. So, when this 30 days is over, you still go from again, from a thousand leads to 5,000 to 10,000 that your business will keep growing from there. Now, we're moving into week number three, which is called pre-launch week, okay? Now, we've got a thousand leads on our list. These people are excited that you provide value. You haven't sold them anything yet. They want to give you money. They want something more, right? They're looking for something. So, this is when the pre-launch week starts. So, this is where you're going to start actually selling your thing, okay? But there's a strategy. When I do the pre-launch correctly, the audience is going to tell me what they want because you may be thinking, I don't have a product to sell you. I don't have anything that I can actually sell these people. The good news is you don't stress about it because they're going to tell you exactly what they want and you're just going to give it to them, okay? So, this is how it works. This is what pre-launch looks like, okay? It's a five-day pre-launch. So, day number one, the first thing you're doing is you're going to send an email out to these thousand people on your email list, okay? And basically, I'm going to do is I'm going to ask them what they want. Say, hey, right now, I'm putting together a course or a training program or whatever you want to call it about my topic, photography, wrestling, you know, bad men, whatever your thing is, right? I'm putting that course on bad men and I've been providing a ton of value in these reforms trying to find out what people are looking for. And I'm just curious for you, like, what's the number one thing that you're interested in knowing about how to insert whatever you're good at, right? And then you send the email out and then your job is just to say back and let them tell you, okay? They're going to respond back and like, oh, I'm curious about this. Oh, I saw your, you know, they all joined your list because they know that you provide value. So, they look at you as an expert already. So, like, well, my question is what about this? What about this? And let them start telling you exactly what they want. Okay? So, that's day number one is just asking what they want you to create. Okay? My favorite question is like, what's the number one question you have about blank? And then fill in the blank, the thing that you have, right? And the more specific you are in that question, the better. For example, if I say, what's your number one question about making more money? Like, that's such a generic question, it's not going to get really good responses back. If I make it very specific, what's your number one question about how to add 500 people a day to your email list? What's the number one question about how to sell more things on eBay? Like, the more specific it is, the better questions you'll get back from people. Okay? All right, that's day number one. Day number two, you're going to send out your second email to this list. Okay? Day number two, what you're going to tell them is like, oh my gosh, I asked you guys what you wanted. The response was insane. I got so many good feedback, so many awesome stuff. I'm excited now. From that, I got like 20 questions came back in. This is going to come the outline for the course I'm going to be putting together. I'm so excited for it. And just want to thank you guys so much. If you have any other questions, please send them along my way that way. I can finalize my outline from B creating today. And thank you so much. That's it. Okay. Day number one, ask them what day number two told them how excited you were. Get some more feedback response. All right, that takes us to day number three. Now, this is where you're going to ask your audience to actually hold you accountable. Okay? This is basically what the email says. Hey, as you know, I'm putting together this course. I'm really excited. The problem is in the past, you know, I would have an idea and I would just kind of push it out and push it out and push it out. And sometimes it would take three or four, six months or longer and I never get it done. And so, I want you guys to hold me accountable because I want this to get done because I know how powerful and how important it is to me and to you. So, my game plan is I want to launch this next Tuesday. And so, what I need for you guys to do is put, I'm putting this on my calendar now. I'm holding myself accountable. Next Tuesday, this is going live. I want you to put on your calendar as well. Make sure you're, you have the date down that way you can hold me accountable. We know next Tuesday, this is going live. Like no matter what happens, we're going to make this thing and it's going to be amazing. So, now they're like, oh my gosh, this is actually happening. It's Tuesday. It's coming out. They start getting some anticipation, some excitement. You're, they see your excitement about it too. So, it starts building some of that energy and that brings us now to day number four. Now, day number four now is where you're going to take them from your email list and you're going to have them move on to an early bird list. Okay, so this is what it looks like. Email will say something like, hey, all right, you guys are holding me accountable. Tuesday is happening. I just put up a page that shows that this is coming soon. It's an early bird page. And if you go to this page and you put your email address, then you're going to get on a special early bird list. Now, the early bird list means you're going to get access to this course before everybody else does, about an hour or two before everybody else does. This is kind of a free thing. So, if you want to get an early bird list, there's a link down below. Send them to a new ClickFunnels page that basically is an early bird list and go over there to the email address. And that way you're taking your thousand email buyers and figuring out of all these people who are the most excited and the hottest. Right? So, from there, save it again. This is a funnel, right? Million people, 100,000. We've got a thousand leads right now on your list. From a thousand leads, you might get 100 to go and put it on the early bird list. Okay, now you know that, okay, if my thousand leads, 10% of these 100 people are excited. They're ready to buy. They sent it for an early bird so they can buy it earlier than everybody else. Right? All right. Day number five is all about getting as many people from your thousand person list onto the early bird list as possible. So, we do a closing cart and this is not closing like a shopping cart. This is closing the early bird list. Right? So, that means it's basically the email is going to say, hey, this is your last chance to get on the early bird list. We're going live next Tuesday, as you know. So, if you want to be on this list and get access to the course before everybody else, now is the time to do it. That way you go from the thousand people on your list to maybe 100 on your pre-launch list, maybe 150, 200 or so. Right? Again, the goal is get as many people from your core list to pre-launch list as humanly possible. So, that takes us through week number three. So, right now, week number one, we build a list. Week number two, we build a list. Week number three, we did the pre-launch. Now, week number four, guess what we're doing? We are going into launch week. This is where you actually start making money. So, we take all the effort we put up to this point. We're going to transition from leads into actual money. Now, before I get all the way into launch week, I want to make you guys a really quick special offer for my bestsellingbook.com secrets. People always tell me like, if you want to start an online business, the very first book you need to read is dot-com secrets. If you don't have a copy yet, you can get a free copy at dot-comsecrets.com. This book's been read by over 300,000 people. In fact, Tony Robbins said, it's a simple process that any company can use to geometrically improve their traffic, conversion, sales online. Dan Kennedy said, go to this book searching for deep understanding and profound clarity about the structure and the science of effective marketing to be applied in the online media universe. And again, thousands of entrepreneurs, just like you see most of the gurus online. Most of them read this book initially before they launched their business, which means you need to do that as well. And again, you get a copy for free at dot-comsecrets.com. Okay, with that said, let's jump into launch week. Here we go. All right, so launch week. This is what the structure looks like. Day number one, to the early bird list, you're going to send an email saying, hey, guess what? The course is live. It's amazing. Go send it right now. It's going to be open to the general public in two hours from now. You guys get early bird access. Okay. Now, again, these are the people that are your super fans of the most exciting. You provided so much value to them. They went from your core list to your early bird list. And so what happens is you're in that first two hours is where the majority of your sellers are going to come before the car even opens. Right? So you send that out. Now, some people do an early bird two hours before. Other people do it an entire day before and give early birds a full day. Either way, it still fits into the structure. All right, day number two now, what you're going to do is you're going to email the early birds again and your full list. So I send the entire list and email saying, hey, we're officially launched. Go sign up. The course is ready. You send them all to the page right there. The most emotional buyers have already bought. Now, we're transitioning on day number three to starting to get the logical buyers to be interested. Right? We're trying to send out more messages just to give them a reason to buy and reason to go relook at the sales page and things like that. So day number three, what we do, we send out a message about why. Why did you create this product? Why did you create this course? Why should they actually care about it? Right? So email is basically saying, I created this course because I've been in these forums for the last couple of months. I've been writing value and everyone keeps asking the same questions over and over and over again. I wanted to create something that would put all these things in one spot to make sure your question got answered. Right? And you explain why you created the thing and you put a link back to your sales page. Day number four, this is where we start trying to speak even more to the logic. Right? Help them understand like, hey, if you buy this course, this is the positive ROI you're going to get from it. Okay? Now, ROI doesn't always mean how much money are they going to make. Sometimes it does in the business thing. Like, you buy this course for $1,000, you're going to make $10,000. Right? There's an ROI there. But sometimes, let's say you're in the dating market. Like, the ROI is like, you buy this course, return your investments, you're going to need to find a girlfriend. Right? In the fitness industry, right? You're going to buy this course, the return isn't more money, the return is going to get more health. So, here I share the facts and the figures of what's the ROI they're going to get when they invest in the course today. That moves us now to day number five. This is where we start introducing urgency and scarcity. Right? So, here it's like, hey, tomorrow the car is going to close. This is your last shot to buy the product. You got to go right now and we push people to the car close. And day number six is the last call. We're basically saying, hey, last call, we're pulling down the order form here at midnight tonight. And you send out one, at least one. Usually, I send three or four emails on cart close day. And what's crazy, we see, is normally what happens is on day number one, the early bird launch, you'll see huge spike in sales. Day two, you see another spike in sales and the whole full list gets it. And day three, four or five, sales can come in four or five, five, they start going in day number six is where the majority of your sales, usually half of your sales will come from day number six as you start closing down the cart. And now you are at the end of our 30 day cycle. And if you guess correctly, we spent week one, week two building a list. We also kept building a list on week three and four, but we'll talk about that because we don't stop building a list ever, right? Week number three to the pre-launch, got people excited, got to be part of what we were creating. And then week number four, we actually launched it. We closed down the cart. And if you follow this process correctly, the goal was to get 1000 people on your list and from there to make your first thousand dollars. Again, this is the process we've used over and over and over again. This is how I got started, is how you get started as well if you're trying to figure out how to get a list and start making money very, very quickly. Now, I've had a ton of fun making this video for you, but I hate talking at you. I love to talk with you. So I set up a really cool group.
