Good morning, good morning. Alright, we're at I forget how bad that is. It was a crazy day. I took an Uber ride home and I was taking an Uber. I think the Uber died. I just got done pushing an Uber driver up the hill. Cars broken. Hope to make it. Okay, so we are in an Uber. And now the car is working again. We just gotta do what we can already. We gotta pack up this room. We have to get all of our garbage to fit into one bag to take to the Masamar and to the safari. So tomorrow we are heading out. So it will be a fun day. I am taking on the trip tomorrow and we will see some lions and zebras. We are about to jump on a safari. Check it out. These are the private planes we are taking to the safari. Hopefully we survive. We are about to go to on Sporey. Oh yeah. Hey guys. You guys can see the fight week. There is like all of these tents, tents, tents and way back there is our Masengan. I was so excited. Alright, welcome to our tent. Welcome to the Masaimara. Let me show you the tent. Lamping at its finest. We have these cool little African Masaimara lamps which are pretty cool. Nice little makeup station per se. And here oh you have a fire alarm. You know it is real camping when there is a fire alarm. Hot water, cute little lamp, tiles, tiles. The best part of every day is that we wake up with a guy who wakes us up to go safari. He doesn't knock but he just peeks his head in and goes hello, hello, good morning. It is so peaceful the way that he wakes us up. Last year we actually asked him to do the voice recording of him waking me up. So I would hold the cell phone up to him and I would say can you just do that thing how you wake us up in the morning? And I saved that on my phone and I made it my alarm clock and it really scares people. Good morning, hello, good morning, hello, good morning. Good morning. So we are going in the higher balloon and we are going to go above all the animals and see them. It is a wish pod. You excited? No problem. So excited. I can't wait. Those baskets over there.
