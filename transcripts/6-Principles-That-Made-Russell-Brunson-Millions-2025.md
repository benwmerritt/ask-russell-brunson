## Transcript
What's up everybody? This is Russell. Welcome back to the show. Okay. Today's episode, I want to talk about something that most people don't talk about. They don't share outside of their own internal company. So, and that is your values. What are your company values? Do you have those yet? I'm asking because for a long, long time, I always thought that I was like, values are cheesy. Why would you do those inside your company? What's the purpose of them? I would read people's values and they'd be a bunch of words. I'm like, that seems so stupid. Like I don't want to do that. So I fought it for a long time. So I had to click funnels. We never really had a formula like these are the core company values. We had values. We had things, but was never like finalized and like printed on the wall or was like a thing. And I remember over the last year, I had a chance to go to a couple people's offices. I remember going to Ryan Panetta's office and he had a big old thing, like his values like on the wall is like, that's kind of cool. And I went to Andy Elliott's the same kind of thing. And then recently, just so you guys know some internal workings inside of ClickFunnels, we basically took our company, we separated into two companies, just to be able to handle employees and management, a whole bunch of stuff differently, right? Also different goals and focuses. And so one side of our company is ClickFunnels, which is the software side. And one side is called Prime Mover, which is the education coaching info products side of the business, right? They still work tandem hand in hand, but we've set up separate them differently. So now we have two different CEOs, two different, like all different things, right? Which has been a really, really cool move. So we made that separation officially started January 1st of this year. And then the new CEO we brought in for the coaching side, his name is Bill Allen. Bill's been an Atlas member. He's built a huge company. He's awesome. And we brought him in to be like the official CEO of the Prime Mover company. And one of the first things you want to do is like establish our company values. I'm like, no, it's company values are cheesy. It's like, he's like, no, you don't understand. It's like this completely radically transformed our entire business doing it. They're really cool. So we actually did a two day planning event, planning a whole bunch of stuff. And then one of them was like, my homework was like, Russell, you have to figure out what value like what are your values? Like what are those things? And, and again, in the past, I always hated values. I look at people's value list and it's like hard work, integrity, you know, and those things are all great. But I don't know, there's something about like, I just didn't connect with me. And I think it's because obviously they weren't my values. They weren't the things I was focusing on. And so I had the last two or three weeks to think about this for the Prime Mover company. What are the core values one as a company as a, you know, and, but also it bleeds more than just the company also bleeds into the community. And so I want to share with you guys for a couple reasons. Number one, I think there's really cool lessons behind each of the values, which I think you get value from. Number two, if you're looking for like company core values for your own company, hopefully this will help kick off kick start the exercise in your own mind. Maybe you can borrow some of our values. And number three, these also should be can and should be the values of our community as a whole. And so I thought I would share them for those reasons and hopefully enjoy them. And it's going to be a lot of fun. Okay, so that's kind of game plan for today's podcast. And I hope you guys enjoy it. I hope you get a lot of cool ideas from it. And hopefully it motivates you and inspires you. So first off, I want to lead with like the name of the company, right? When we made this separation, I was like, what's the name of the info pride info side of the company? And a lot of you guys know, I've talked about this concept of a prime mover for a while, right? I ran in her books Atlas shrugged and found that she talks about a prime mover. She talks about the prime mover in like in an engine or in a train is the engine that pulls everything around, right? The poles that they most of her characters are the prime movers. If you read out the shrug, right, Dagny and Hen Henk Reardon and like a John Galt, like they are the they are the prime movers of society who are changing things, right? Or if you read, found head like Rory gives the prime mover, right? It's the person that's like moving societies and moving things. And I thought that was an iron ran term. I didn't realize going back in time that like Aristotle, I think actually found something I think might have said before Aristotle, Aristotle talks about this concept of a prime mover, right? And when he talks about it, he talks about God being the prime mover of the universe. And he talks a lot about it. But one interesting things he said that I thought was really powerful was that God is the prime mover is he doesn't go like he's like moving people, right? He sets a standard and people move towards him. And I was like, ooh, that's such a cool like analogy. And so for prime movers, like for me, it's like the prime movers are the people in the world that are changing the world, right? Which are entrepreneurs and creators and like the people that I serve anyways, like we are prime movers. But number two, it's like, and what's the prime mover do? It sets the standard that draws people to them, right? And so I love that like analogy. And like, and so for our company, like with my employees, my team, like we are the prime movers, like each of us have to become prime movers. And that's like, that's this top level thing, right? Who we are. And so that's kind of where it all began with. And then from there, it's like, you know, what are the core values of a prime mover? And again, these are for my internal team, internal company. But I think for a lot of you guys, who are prime movers, like you're the prime mover in your business, you're the prime mover in your community. Like these are values, I think that you should think about and adopt as well. Okay. All right. So as I started doing this, this values exercise was tough for me because there were so many things I started value, I started, I started making a list, the list got really like way too big. And I was like, I'm like, Bill, how many values can I get? He's like five or six. I'm like, Oh, because I got like 40. He's like, no, it doesn't work that way. He's like, you got to pick one of the core things. And so the goal with the values too is like to set this as a standard for the company where it's like, in any interactions, like you can run it through these core values that fit our core, our core values. If it doesn't, then, then we need to change it, right? Or if it's like an interaction, if you see somebody on your team doing something, it's like, ah, this doesn't fit through the lens of our core values. It gives you a way to coach and to motivate and to, to readjust and realign somebody on your team as well. And so, um, yeah, so hopefully these values will help you for yourself as well. Just kind of look at things through this lens of just like, okay, these are, these are the values. And I'm checking the things I'm doing based on these, right? Okay, so I'm going to go through these in no particular order, the other than the way that we kind of presented them to our team today. So the first one, and this was tough because like initially it was two different values. And then over time, I tried to figure how to put them into one value. So the two values were growth and contribution. Those are the two values that kind of started with, right? And if you've heard me talk about Tony Robbins, Six Human Needs, like this is kind of where this concept first came from. He talks about there's needs of the body or the personality and there's needs of the spirit, right? And needs of the body without going too deep. There's like, there's variety, there's certainty, there's love and connection, there's significance. Those are the four needs of the body, right? And all humans would figure out ways to get those needs all met. And I'm not going to go deep into the philosophy of Tony Robbins, Six Human Needs, because this is one of my favorite things to talk about. And I could and I would love to. Maybe that's the podcast episode of the day. There are basically two of the needs like love and connection, significance or opposites, right? Which is funny. And then certainty and variety are opposites too. So we have, but we have these four needs and like everything in our lives, like based on like, we figured out how to get those needs met. And sometimes it's positive, sometimes it's negative. And like, that's the first thing that everyone figures that out. But after those needs are met, then you transition to the needs of the spirit, which a lot of people never get there, but the needs of the spirit are growth and contribution. Those are two needs of the spirit, right? And so I love that. Like, as soon as you get your body and your personality under control, then you can transition to the needs of the spirit, which are growth and contribution. And again, that's where I think happiness fulfillment, everything happens there inside of growth and contribution. And again, so growth is like personal development. How do you become better? How do you, how do you achieve more? How do you become more? How do you do more? Like, growth is like that, that driving, it's the driving value, right? It's, again, it's one of our needs. Like, it's one of the needs of the spirit. And so growth is one that I love, especially as a prime mover, right? As a prime mover, right? We need to be the ones at the forefront. We're growing and developing and like becoming the person we're supposed to become, right? Growth, growth, growth, growth. Okay. So that's one of the needs of the spirit. And then the second one is contribution, which is like, is like taking your tools and your talents and your gifts and contributing and helping other people, right? And expert secrets book, I talk about this a lot. I talk about like, those who've become an expert, right? They're, they're coming in and they're in this phase of growth, like, I'm growth, growth, growth, like they're personally developing. And then eventually it's like, I want to contribute, like I'm learning so much. And that's when you become the expert. And like, now you're shifting from a growth mode to contribution, right? In the secrets of success business is the business about personal growth, growing, growing, growing, growing, growing. And you transition to the Russell Brunson, you know, to the marketing side, click funnel side, like that's contributions. Like now I'm starting a business. So for me in my mind, like this growth and contribution concept, I think about, I talk about all the time, like the two important things, like we should be growing and developing as prime movers. And then after we get these skills, that's we got to be contributing, right? And so those are the two extremes. But I titled my value for our company, we tell it growth through contribution. And the reason why I shared that is because, and I'll tell you guys a story. So this in a lot of years in my background, as you can tell about for my cauliflower here, I'm a wrestler. It is my core passion to this day. Like if I could, if I could quit business and just become a full-time wrestler again and actually compete at a high level, 100%, I would do it. As much fun as I have making money and growing businesses. I've never felt more value. Like, I don't know, I love wrestling more. So that's all. When I'll send out, I'm like, the feeling of being my hand raised in a wrestling match is the greatest feeling I've ever had. Like, bar none. I've never been able to sync it with anything else. I love that feeling. So I love wrestling. And I learned this lesson. So when I was in high school, I was, I was, I was an athlete, and I wanted to grow, right? So I was learning how to grow through like strength training, cardio, skill sets, wrestling mindset. Like it was this growth phase. And I loved it. I was obsessed with it. Right. And I grew, grew, grew. So in high school, I was a state champ. I took second place in the nation. I was an all-American. Right. And so I grew to the top echelons of our country, like in wrestling. Right. And I remember after my senior year, took second place in the nation. And that summer, my coach, one of my coaches, Greg Williams messaged me. He's like, Hey, he's like, do you want to come coach at a wrestling camp? And I was like, why would I do that? Like I'm, you know, in my head, cocky, you know, 18 year old Russell is like too cool for that. He's like, well, pay $100 a day if you come coach. I'm like, done. Cause like I was making $0 an hour. And so I went down this wrestling camp and I was there for five days. I got a coach. I got 500 bucks from it. But he had me coach these kids. And so there's a lot of moves that we're coaching on. But for me, my, the thing that I'm the best at, if you look at like all the moves in wrestling, there's a move called the cheap tilt. I'm obsessed with that. I think it's the greatest movement all wrestling. If you ever wrestling, I'll hit you in it a hundred times. It doesn't matter how good you are. Like it's just, it's my move. I get out of the best in the world. And so they like, Hey, teach, he's got the cheap tilt. I'm like, okay. So I'm, I go out there to teach the kids a cheap tilt, which isn't a hard move, but there's a lot of like, Ooh, intricacies. I go out there. Here's that. I do guys, I show them, okay, go to the move. And then what happened is the kids all went out there and they all did it wrong. 100% nobody got close. I'm like, you guys are so dumb. I didn't say that, but in my head, I'm like, they're so dumb. So I bring them back in, come back in, you guys. Let me show it again, show it again. Okay, go out and do it. They go out to try to do it, and they don't do it again. I was like, so fresh. I bring them all back in again. Okay. So I get down on the map. I'm like, okay, this is how it works. And so I'm looking at all the movement. Okay. Your elbow has to go here. Your knees got to go here pointing towards the mouth. This is how you pinch your hips. This is how I started like, I started breaking down all of the pieces to get it to actually fit together. Right. And they had that I showed at the move and I was like, okay, here's how it works. So then the kids went out, they start trying again, and then they were able to do it. Like they started to actually connect and say, okay, elbows here, hips here. Right. And then they got up, they were still missing pieces of prime back in my okay, well, actually also your head's got to go here. Your arm goes here. And so I kept going back and forth and back and forth like an hour with these kids breaking down the move, trying to figure it out. And as I was doing that, I started realizing all these reasons that the move actually worked, which I didn't even know consciously. Right. I knew from a feeling standpoint, because I'd done it so many times, but I didn't realize. And so that became aware of it all of a sudden, like, I was like, oh, I realized in that, in that match, I lost the stone. So it's because I wasn't able to hit it. It's because of this and because of that, like positioning wrong. And I started growing again. Right. There comes a time in our life where personal growth, we hit a growth ceiling, right? Like you growing, like you're growing, you're consuming, you're learning and you're loving and eventually the ceiling. And then the only way to continue to grow is by transitioning to contribution. When I started coaching kids, all of a sudden I broke through that ceiling and I started becoming better. And that whole five days I was teaching the kids move, learning stuff. And as I was doing, as I was coaching people, as I was contributing to other people, I became a better athlete. Like it was, it was like this exponential shift in my growth. Okay. And so contributions next phase. And so the, the value that I gave our company was growth through contribution. Okay. So we should be focused on personal growth, but also like, as you guys are learning things, we got to be contributing back to our community, to each other, to other employees, other teammates. Like we all need to be growing together. We need to be contributing because as we do that, as you learn how to contribute and open up ideas and information and stuff that other people, that's when you grow the next level. Okay. So value number one, as a prime mover, somebody on our team, and obviously you guys as well as part of our community is growth through contribution. Right. And again, I think expert secrets is like my favorite explanation of it where it's just like, you're growing, you're growing, you're growing, and eventually you hit the ceiling and you transitioning to like, all right, I'm going to become an expert. I'm going to serve. I'm going to contribute. That's where you break through that ceiling. And that's where your, your growth becomes exponential. Okay. It's, it's really cool. In fact, if you want to get scriptural, there's a scripture in the book of Moses where God's talking about what his role is. And he says that, behold, this is my work and my glory to bring about the immortality and true life of man. Think about this. Like God is perfect, all knowing, all powerful. Like he doesn't, he's not going to get smarter. He's not going to get more powerful, but how does he grow? He grows by giving us glory. Like when we become better, right, that's how he grows. And that's the same thing that grows through contribution. Like, like as we start helping other people and they become better, that's how we grow as well. Like, I don't know if that makes sense, but it makes total sense in my head. So value number one is growth through contribution. Okay. Value number two, this one actually came from Napoleon Hill, the man. If you've ever read his book, Law of Success, which is a huge book set or you're thinking, Grow Rich, both are amazing. Or any of his books, honestly, he talks about these, these laws of success over and over again. But one of the laws of success that he talks about, and I'm going to pull up the actual definition here so I can, I can make sure I, I quote it correctly. But he talks about this, this concept. And then I took the concept and I added my own, my own kind of name to it. But this is the concept he says, you have to, this is the law of success. He says, build a habit of doing more than you're paid for. Okay. Build a habit of doing more than you're paid for. Now, in the book, thinking Grow Rich, he's talking about how to make more money, right? So he's talking about like, about always over delivering, right? Always do more than you're paid for. So someone pays you, you know, for this job, do that plus more. And says, if you always do more than you're paid for, eventually get paid for more than what you do, right? Like that's the principle. That's the law of success, right? And he talks about it's funny because then point, you know, like he's big, he was big into nature. He's thinking about nature, like nature always over delivers, right? It's like the tree, his big huge tree has all these apples on it, right? And there's enough apples and stuff for the tree to produce and then drops all the excess. And then from there, more trees grow, more things. And so like nature always over delivers in everything, right? And that's how the whole ecosystem, everything works. And so for us, it's the same thing, like we have to be over delivering. And so the concept in Napoleon Hill is build a habit of doing more than you're paid for. Now this is not just tied to like a salary though. This is in every situation in life, right? If the value is always over delivered, that's our value always over delivered, right? And it's about, it's about doing more than you're paid for. So think about this in every interaction you have with somebody, I think about with my wife, right? When I hang out with my wife, if I'm in that situation and I'm just kind of doing the bare minimum, we're gonna have a minimum marriage or it's gonna fall apart, right? If I come to that relationship, I'm like, how can I over deliver with my wife today, right? When I'm over delivering, the marriage blossoms, it grows, right? If I'm working with an employee on my team, right? And if I figure how can I over deliver with this person, every interaction, every content, every time I talk to them, if I can over deliver in that moment, what happens, right? The relationship grows, it blossoms. We're talking to a customer, I'm talking to a coaching student or someone on my mastermind, like in every situation, I gotta figure out how to over deliver. When someone buys coaching from me, right? How do I over deliver at the coaching point? How to over deliver in the course? How to over deliver in social media? Every interaction, if I focus on doing more than I paid for, over delivering in that situation, that situation, everything will grow from it, right? So that's the concept we gotta start thinking through is like, how do we always over deliver? And this is true again for employees, it's like, if you're getting paid for this, but you're doing this, eventually it's like, man, this person always like crushing it. I go to the people in my company who have risen to the top echelons, there's people who show up every day, they're always over delivering, we're just like, man, if this person left, I would be screwed, right? That's the kind of value you gotta deliver at every single level. And so that's the next value is always over delivered. And again, this is true in every situation as an employee, as a contractor, as a, as a, you know, as a, as a husband, as a, as a parent, as a kid, as a, like in every situation in life, it's always over delivered, right? Whenever I'm in any interaction with somebody, how to over deliver? I think about this, you know, again, this is the value for our core company. So I'm trying to tell everyone from the very top down to the sports team, like sports team, when you're answering someone's ticket, it's not just the answer to get it done, like how do you over deliver every single ticket, ticket after ticket after ticket, if you're always over delivering, like it changes everything, right? And so that's kind of the concept. This podcast, I'm trying to over deliver, right? I'm trying to put more effort, more energy, how do I always over deliver? So if you're going to dedicate 30 minutes, you're going to have to listen to this, they're timing you're like, holy crap, I got that from Russell in 30 minutes for free. Like imagine if I go and buy the next thing, the next thing, like where's it going to over deliver here and over deliver here and so on and so forth, right? So always over deliver is value number two. Okay, you just go to that so far. So number one, growth through contribution, number two, always over deliver. All right, let me transition now to value number three. So this is one that has to do with how we do our work. I call this value funnel hack first. And this is the reason it's funny because like when we launched the ClickFunnels community a decade ago, I taught this concept of funnel hacking. And I still remember a night. So we were, so when we first built ClickFunnels, it was me, it was Todd Dickerson, and then we had another co-founder named Dylan Jones, one of the most brilliant guys I know. And I remember we were all, all, Todd and Dylan flew out to Boise. We're in our little tiny office working on ClickFunnels. And then Todd was coding, doing all the genius Todd stuff. And then Dylan was doing the UI design and stuff. And I was writing copy. Right. And so what I was doing is, is very first step, I'm trying to write copy for the ClickFunnels launch, right? And so I'm going through, trying to figure out like the scripting and the, the VSL, what I'm going to say and all that kind of stuff. Right. So what I'm doing is I'm going back and I'm literally pulling every single VSL I can find, every single software funnel. So I'm funnel hacking and finding all these things. And I'm listening to sales videos, I'm listening to things. And so I'm going through this whole concept. And I remember like three or four hours, it was probably, it was probably two o'clock in the morning where three or four hours into work. And then Dylan, again, one of our co-founders, and Dylan, by the way, is the one who built the original ClickFunnels editor, did the original ClickFunnels UI, like he's brilliant. And he came over to me and he's like, he's like, so what are you doing? So I'm like, oh, I'm writing copy. So I'm trying to find as many examples ahead of time. So I have my swipe file that I'm going to work off of. I was funnel hacking, right? And he said, he's like, so interesting. He's like, when I do my design, I'm the same way. I'm like, really? So I walk over to his desk and he shows me, he's doing the UI design for ClickFunnels, he's doing the UI for the editor stuff. And what he is, he's on, I think it was dribble.com, DRIBBBLE.com, which is like this marketplace for designers. And he's looking at UI design and like layouts and stuff. And he was just the same thing I was doing, but he was doing it over there with UI. And he had like, funnel hacked a thousand and everything. And from there, from the funnel hacking, then he started creating the UI for ClickFunnels, UI for the editor stuff like that. And I think what most people do wrong in business as a whole is they try to just be creative, maybe creative. It's like, no, no, no, no, stop. This almost became a value, but it didn't quite fit in. So I am weaving it into funnel hack first, but another value that I had initially was like money follows speed. We have to move quickly. Money follows speed, money follows speed. And so if you think about that, if you're going to go and start from scratch, your time from beginning to execution is long. Right? Instead, I want to go and figure out what's the best practice. What's working today right now? And I'm going to go through everything and then take that. Like we're working off the shoulders of giants. We're taking all of the stuff that's been done in the past and we're building from there. So we're funnel hacking first. Okay. A good example is emails. We had an email copyrighter for a while and it's like every time you do an email, you, this person, to be vague, this person would go and they would write a whole new email and they'd like, here's the email. Like, do you approve it? I'm like, it's all right, but I'm like the thing you're promoting, I've written emails for this eight times in the last 10 years. I mean, before you ever write an email to promote the thing, like look at what I've done in the past. Like go look at every single email Russell ever wrote to promote this thing or something similar. If it's a webinar, go find every email campaign where I ever promoted a webinar and go look at them all. Right? Look at them all dissect them, figure it out. And from there, write an email. Cause right now you're trying to re-guess, okay, what would be the best way to get somebody to buy this product? Like I've, I have done this hook thousands of times. We've tested it. We have perfected it. Like, like always go funnel hack first, get the data first and from this like, man, this email was great. Or else I'm just going to tweak the headline a little bit here and I'm not touching anything else. Like, cool, that's the bet. That's, that's the right response. It's not like, oh, I was creative. I built some. What do you think? Like, what, why would you do that? Okay. I think that's in all areas of life. Like again, from HR, right? HR, it's like, uh, as people come, like, here's all bunch of different ways to do things. Like, well, what do we do in the past? Like, we have not, this is not the first time we thought through it or what's company we're modeling. How do they do like, like, don't try to like, reinvent the wheel from scratch. It's like finding out who's already done this and that becomes the baseline. So we start from it and from there we work, we work and build something amazing. Right. We can do, we can be creative, but the creativity is built on a, on a foundation of funnel hacking. Right. We funnel hack first and from there we go and we grow. Okay. And this is true in all aspects. And one of my, um, one of our partners does a, does a bunch of, uh, video stuff and then he always tells me, like, before I created a sales video, he's like, and he's the one that does all the big fancy, like funnel hacking, like trailers, like those things. He's like, I go and I watch a hundred trailers. He's like, I'm looking for inspiration a whole bunch of different places. And then from there I get the mindset of like, Hey, now I've seen like what's possible. And like, like my mind was stretched and grown. And now from there, I take what I have and I can build on top of that. And I can add my creativity and add my sprinkles and he's like, I'm not just starting. And he talks about, he's like, he's like, I got to find four or five inspirations. I like the most. I'm looking at those as inspirations that I'm remixing it on top of it. Right. Bands do this music does this, right? Like people are just inventing music. Like let me think of a, just do a C and then we'll do it and a right. No, it's like they're finding inspiration. Oh, here's music. I love how they did the riff here. I love how they did this. I like the flutes and then things and I like, okay, let me go and from there, based on like funnel hacking, first I'm going to build something that's going to be my version, but it's going to be, it's going to be based on these, these principles, right? And so always it's like, if money falls speed, then we have to funnel hack first funnel hack first is the value in every area, every department, every everything, funnel hack first. That's how we're going to beat people to the finish line because we're not reinventing the wheel every single time we do something. Okay. So that is value number three. Okay. We got growth through contribution, always over deliver funnel hack first. Now moving to value number four. And this is one, this one, it's so powerful, so simple. It's so hard to do, but yet it transforms everything. This is based on a book written by Jaco. Jaco spoke of funnel hacking live 18 months ago and I had him just come and speak on one principle that I cared about, which was extreme ownership. Okay. And if you if you haven't had extreme ownership yet, it is probably one that it's just, it's so simple and it's so powerful and so good. And Jaco is a, is a military dude. He talks about how in the military, like every situation you have to, like if it's something doesn't work, it's always your fault, right? And I'm going to read this book and it's like, that's awesome for military. That's not true for me. Like that guy screwed up that person's script. They did it wrong. Like all this kind of things, right? And after reading the book and then hiring him and paying him and for a ton of money comes to be FHL and just like, give this thing great and grain to my head. It's like, okay, if I'm going to be successful, I take extreme ownership over everything. Right? If something's wrong with my marriage, it's so easy. Like, Oh, well, it's because of that person. It's because of them, right? No, no, no, no, no. If something's wrong in your marriage, it's because of you. Something's wrong with your family. It's because of you. Something's wrong in your business. It's because of you. Something didn't go right on the product launch. It's because of you. Something, like, and yes, it's so easy to point out words. It's, it's, it's so easy to point out words, right? But the reality is even if you're pointing out words, like it didn't work because of them. Okay. Well, that's your fault. It's your fault. Either you got the wrong person or you didn't train them correctly or you didn't get the right tools, didn't get the right resources, didn't get enough background information or something. There's something wrong and it's always you. Okay. And the reality is as hard as that is to do because it's like, man, I blew up, I screwed up again. I screwed up again. I screwed like as hard as that can be. It's also very empowering because if it's their fault, I can't do anything about it. Right? But if it's my fault, it's like, I can actually do something about it. Okay. What can I do different? How can I change my approach? How can I change the inputs? How can I change? Like, I get opens up a whole world of possibilities when you start pointing in towards and you take extreme ownership over the concept. Right? And so that's the key. And so in all aspects of business, right? And it starts with you as a leader. Okay. You as the prime mover of your business, of your community, like you have to take extreme ownership initially. Okay. You take extreme ownership first. And what happens is as you start doing it, then your team will like your managers and the employees, but you have to like building a culture of extreme ownership from top all the way down to the bottom. And that is one of the keys. If you, if you don't do that, that's where everything kind of starts falling apart. Okay. So extreme ownership is, is one of the values. And it starts with you taking extreme ownership, focusing on it and really focusing there. Okay. And then trading your team through that. Right? The employees, everyone else in your team, like if they're not taking extreme ownership, like, again, it becomes a value or someone comes back and like, oh, I tried this thing, but so and so, like the affiliate over here or the email thing or like, they're trying to blame something else. Like, okay, I understand that, but what's one of our core values, extreme ownership, like you have to stop, you have to stop pointing the finger. Like if it didn't work, it's because of you. Something that you didn't do in the process is why it broke. Okay. And there's only you can fix. So figure out what did I do wrong in the process? How can I fix me? If I fix me, then there's a shot at it fixing the outcome, but there's no way of pointing at somebody else that you're ever going to fix the outcome. It's impossible. Okay. So extreme ownership from the top to the bottom, which is such a good solid value for any kind of prime mover. All right. You see, as I'm going through these now, I'm like, I love these values because these values for me are like, yeah, like I don't get tattoos, but if I did, I would tattoo these to my face. All right. Value number five, this one is really cool. This one, I wanted this one because this is actually a value literally in almost every religion of all time. It doesn't matter what religion you are. In fact, it's funny, I was talking to my team about this. I'm like, I actually have a paper somewhere that has the, I looked over and it was all my desk. So the value is the golden rule. You guys know the golden rule is doing to others as they would have to them as you would have them doing to you, right? The golden rule, very simple. And you think about this, like back in the day, this was a big thing. In fact, even Napoleon Hill in 1919, he launched the golden, Hill's golden rule. This whole magazine is based on this one principle, which is following the golden rule. Tons of authors back then wrote about this, this concept of the golden rule. It was like a big thing in the thought mindset of people back in the early 20s. Nowadays, you never hear someone talk about golden rule. At least I don't. Do you ever hear people talk about this? Yet it's like the core fundamental principle of all faiths. And so right here, this little piece of paper I have, it shows the golden rule and a whole bunch of different religions. Some of these religions I've never heard of. And this is a part of this. I found another one later. It hadn't had even more. But almost every major religion on the planet has some form of the golden rule. So I'm going to read a couple of these so you can see like this is a universal thing, right? Okay, so I'll start at the top. The first one says, Brahminism. Bronnism. I don't know that religion, but Brahminism. And this is their version of the golden rule. It says, this is the sum of duty. Do not unto others which would cause you pain if done unto you. Boom. Okay, it's in their scriptures. Next is Buddhism. Here's Buddhism's version. Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful. Boom, golden rule. Confuciusism. Confuciusism. Anyway, everybody sit around. Here's their version. Is there one maxim which ought to be acted upon throughout one's whole life? Surely it is the maximum of loving kindness. Do not unto others what would not have them do unto you. Boom. Okay, next one. Taoism. Regard your neighbor's gain as your own gain and your neighbor's loss as your own loss. Boom. Here we go. Zorotrainianism. I'm sure someone in my search is a follow that faith and you've got it as well. So there you go. That nature alone is good which refrains from doing unto others whatsoever is not good for thyself. Okay, Judaism. Here we go. What is hateful to you? Do not unto your fellow man. That is the entire of the law. All the rest is commentary. Okay, Christianity. All things whatsoever you do that men should do to you, do you even to them for this is the law of the prophets. Matthew 712. I hear it. Islam. Islam says no one of you is a believer until he desires for his brother that which is he desires for himself. Boom. So every faith, every religion has some version of the golden rule and it's something I think we need to bring back into the mindset. So do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Every situation, right? I need this value so when people are interacting with customers or employees or whatever, it's like how would you want to be trained in the situation, right? You submit a support ticket and you're stressed out or something, you know, or the person like comes back and like doesn't give you the full answer. It just gives you that like kind of pushes you off. Like, like that's not how you'd want to be treated. You want something like give you all the answer, all the information and like help give you resources and like hook you up or do it like whatever that is, right? So like that golden rule is like, how would you want to be treated if someone submitted some sport ticket to you? Or if you guys, if you're submitting a sport ticket, like treat that person the same way you'd want to be treated, right? You're on the phone with someone. How would you want to be treated? Like that's the golden rule, right? You meet someone in an event. You meet someone alive. That thing like, like in every situation, right? How would you want to be treated? Okay, the golden rule, like that's the value wanted everyone to have. It's just like making sure that when you're, when you're working with somebody or talking to them or connecting or whatever that is, any points of interaction with another human, that when you're looking at that interaction, you're thinking about, okay, how would I want to be treated in this situation? Yeah. And also do this like as well, like I think about in my company, like I started this by myself 20 years ago, right? And so everything that's growing, like everybody who's we've hired and built a team of like their extension of me, right? In theory. And so a lot of the times it's like also it's like, okay, who's the person that I'm working for? Like, how would they treat someone in this situation? Like if you don't know, it's like, well, how would Russell treat them? I've had a lot of times we've had employees who were going, they'll snap at somebody and it's like, like, you're an extension to me. Like I would never do that. How would you talk to that person if you were me? Like thinking about that, right? I think all those things weave into this golden rule of just like doing to others that you have them doing to you. But then also it's like, you know, the people you're working for or working with, it's like, how would they treat some of this situation? Like I need to match and you sink that I got a funnel hack that and model it in my life as well. Look at that. We're taking values and we're funnel hacking and weaving together. So okay, that's number five. And I got last one last value I'll share and we'll be done for this episode. And this is the one I got a really cool story about. So when I was a kid, in fact, it's funny, we did a viral video on Facebook, we had actors act this whole thing out, hired a Jay, Jay Shetty team, I think built this for us and launched it way back in the day. It was really cool to kind of, they act out this whole situation. But this is the thing happened. I was a kid. I was a kid and it was a Saturday morning and my dad gave us all over chores, listen, my chore was to go clean the car. So go down in the car and I'm, you know, I'm a typical young kid. I'm in there vacuuming, doing stuff down. I'm like, I'm done. I want to go play. I'm gonna play basketball. So I'm like, Hey, dad, I'm done. He's like, he's like, are you? I'm like, Yeah, come check it out. You can see he's done. And my dad stops for the second. He's like, were you proud of it? And I was like, Oh, well, I don't, I mean, I don't know. He's like, well, if you're proud of it, then you're done. But if you're not proud of it, like go keep doing until you're proud of it. So I was like, Okay, so go back down. Okay, I'm proud of it. I'm like, Well, all right, I guess I didn't, I didn't create that well. So I'm like, I'm going to vacuum again, we get all the cracks and we get all the crevices and we do everything, you know. And so I spent more time there for a minute or two or it was good to come back and okay, dad, it's done. I go play basketball. I was like, were you proud of it? I was like, Well, yeah, but well, okay, let me back. So I go back to the end of my okay, let me I keep looking at my okay, well, there's fingerprints on the windows. There's stuff I asked my Washington windows getting clean. So I do this for my dad three or four times, going back and forth, back and forth and find last time I come back, like, dad, the car's done, I could play basketball. I was like, you proud of it. I'm like, Yeah, I am. It's like, cool. If you're proud of it, then you're done. And I remember like, there was like this impact. It hit me. I was like, Whoa, he didn't care. Like, it wasn't what he thought. It was like, was I proud of it? If I was proud of it, then I did the I did the work correctly, right? So our six value created is called the work until proud. Right? Like, when is the work done? It's when you're proud of it. If you're designing something, you're writing an email, you're, you're working, whatever it is, like, when it when all said and done, when you do the work you're supposed to do here inside of our company or inside of your community, whatever it is, like, you got to work until you're proud of it. If you're proud of it, it's like, you're proud of it. Cool. All right. If you're proud of it, not proud of it, good. You know, go for it. And so that's the, that's the, the standard at what we look at, like when work is done, when we're proud of it, we can look at it like, I created that and it turned out really good. I'm proud of that. Therefore, it's finished. Like that's the, that's kind of the, the last value here we had for our company. So let me share with you what we got. These are the, again, the six values that us as the prime mover company are going to be focusing on and embodying inside of our company. It's also the lens that we look at everything, right? Every situation, something like doesn't feel right. It's like, why does that not feel right? It's like, oh, it's because, you know, we're not using the golden rule or, hey, that person's not taking extreme ownership or, hey, that person's not over delivering. Like, like all the, everything comes through this lens of those things, right? And so these are the six values you created. Number one was growth through contribution. Number two is always over deliver. Number three is funnel hack first. Number four is extreme ownership. Number five is the golden rule. And number six is work until proud. So those are the values that I'm very proud of here inside the prime mover company. I think that I think they embody like what I believe, embodies like what I've tried to do from the very beginning. And I think it gives my company, my team, like a framework to look at. I'm hoping also that I've shared this publicly with you guys that it's giving you as a community something to look at as well, like values that us as a community can embody that we can look at, you guys can be doing with your own audiences and your companies, your communities as well. And I also want to recommend you guys figure out like, what are the things that you value most for your company and actually sitting down and doing the exercise and figuring out like, what are the things you want to value and get your team on board. It was really fun today. We did the meeting with our team. We proposed the values and everyone's on fire got message like, that was the best meeting ever. I was like, wow, how interesting. In the past, I remember in click phones, we never focus on the values because like we all should have good values. Like this is just be good people. Like that's the value, right? And it's good when it's a handful of people, but as you grow, it's like you got to have standards for people to look at, right? What are prime movers? What Aristotle say, right? We set a standard and we draw people to us. And so, for us as prime movers of our communities, our companies are whatever it is, like we are setting the standard and draw people to us. If they don't know what that standard is, it's hard for them to follow. And so this is me planning the flag for the prime mover community from our company for our team. This is the standard I am setting. Number one is always going to be like the number one person has grown through contribution between them, always going to try to over deliver everything. I'm always going to follow that person for four, I'm always taking stream ownership, everything. Number five, I'm always going to practice the goal and rule. Number six, I'm going to work until I'm proud. And by doing that, I set the standard and everybody else on our team rises to that. And I hope this is valuable for you guys. I appreciate you guys.
