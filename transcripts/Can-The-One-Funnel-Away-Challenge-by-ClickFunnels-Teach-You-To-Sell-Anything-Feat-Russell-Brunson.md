If you keep doing it, like you have customers and people that eventually like your list get big enough where it's like, I just help people like pushing a rock up a hill, right? And then you get the top and it comes back down, boom, the other side and it starts growing. So it's just having fun and believing that you can actually do it. And then not being so stressed out that like, oh, this is, you know, I'm gonna be successful. It's like, no, like, keep your day job, do some side while you're doing it. Right. So you're not stressed out about money and finances and keep doing it. Have some fun with it and be creative. And then eventually, like, if you keep consistent with it long enough, eventually it's gonna work. If you're like us, you've dreamt of building your own business empire and the freedom it can bring you. But today there's hidden traps on the path of entrepreneurship placed by Big Brother and the Big Brands. So now we're forced to answer hard questions like, how do we grow a real company without taking on debt or giving away ownership? Or how can we get weeds and buyers for our own products when there's so much competition with deep pockets? Finally, those questions are answered and tens of thousands of people are taking the challenge to walk the new path of entrepreneurship. Follow this podcast while I ask about their shocking journey from failure to freedom. You can join them too at onefunnelaway.com. I'm your host, Steve J. Larson, and you're listening to One Funnel Away Stories. What's going on, everyone? I'm Steve Larson. I'm here with a good friend and mentor and brother, I'd say Russell Brunson. What's up, everybody? And if you don't know who he is, you're probably new to this game. So because if you've been an entrepreneur at all, you know exactly who he is. He's the CEO and creator of Cook Funnels, co-founder, and he's been helping millions of entrepreneurs. He's helped me personally create my own business. In fact, everybody that you're actually gonna hear on the show One Funnel Away Stories is actually someone who has come and learned from Russell Brunson himself. Taking the One Funnel Away Challenge and then having success with it. So I'm very excited to have him on the show here. I thought who better to go find and figure out his own One Funnel Away story than Russell Brunson himself. So welcome. I'm excited too. Right now we're on a ship with a whole bunch of Cook Funnels members who are all geeking out on the funnels and stuff. And so this is like my favorite topic in the world. Yeah. It could literally last like a decade and half of my life to talk about this and teach about it. So I'm excited to tell you guys some stories. Super fun. Yeah. We're on the ship. We're right here. It's rocking pretty hard actually. Every wave. There's a big water slide back there. You can see it anyway. It's awesome. The camera falls back or whatever. Just know that it's out of energy. It's sexual. So how did you get started? I know you've answered this a hundred times. But for all the people who are out there and want to go be an entrepreneur and start to get that twitch, the bug, you know, to go do the game. It's the road goes for a while. And it can kind of be a lot of ups and downs. How did you get the, what was the spark for initially? So it was about 15 years ago and I was going to Boise State. I was wrestling there just about my beautiful wife and decided to propose to her. And then after she said, yes, I told my parents and they're like, sweet. So how are you going to actually like pay for that thing called life? And I was like, why don't you support me? And they're like, no, like when you get married, that's where you have the strings and you're on your own. I was like, oh no. And I remember that night I was sitting there watching TV. I was like, how am I going to support my wife? Like I don't want to quit wrestling because that's like my life, my dream. And I was going to school and I was like, you know, she's going to support me obviously for a while, but like I got to figure something out. And right then on TV, there was an infomercial for an event happening at holiday and like the next day, like how to make money on the internet. I was like, I'm in. So I called the number, got my tickets next day on the holiday and sitting in this room with like a hundred other people and the guys talking about the internet and telling all these stories. And I remember I was just like, I mean, this is going to be amazing. And it's funny because there's so many sub stories I could tell, but you know, when I was a kid, I got into direct mail. I remember like learning about how you make money back when I was like 12, 13 years old. And as I was sitting in the hall, they had listening to this guy talk about internet marketing. I was like, this is very similar to what I was learning about before, like how people make money offline. And anyway, me was like, I was in, I got excited. I signed up. I was running the back of my credit card, giving them and I didn't have any money. And but I was charging all this stuff. And I remember that started the process of me learning this whole, this whole game. And I ended up refunding all the money from that event because I didn't have the money anyway. And I wasn't yet married. My wife had probably killed me, but it's like relifted this spark of like, okay, I gotta figure out how to make money. And that's going to be how I'm going to support my wife's like wrestle and be married. And so I started going through and and learning, learning this game, learning how the whole thing worked. And one of my very first, I had a couple of different little product ideas when the first one that had real traction and people heard the story million times is I made a potato gun teaching, excuse me, DVD teach people how to make potato guns. And if you don't know, you take a potato and you shove it down a tube and then you shoot it and explode it. And Steven actually watched this original DVD one time when I was out of town for something and made it on Fun Lacker TV. It was amazing. So the DVD actually worked, right? It did. It was a great potato gun, by the way. It was funny. I was learning about marketing and back then there was a site called Overture and you could go to Overture and type in a keyword and show you how many times each month some of the search is that keyword. So I was like, I typed in potato gun. And remember there's like 18,000 searches a month. I was like, this is my big idea. So I went to help depot with my buddy and we filmed ourselves like buying the pipes and put them together made this whole DVD, which you've seen. It's a great, it's just headshade. It's awesome. It's awesome. I was such a nerd. And we filmed and started selling it online. I put in my very first website, started selling it and started making some money. And it was just like, I was like, this is amazing. I remember every time I make a sale, it'd be like 20, 30 bucks I'd make. And that for me, my wife has date nights to go out and watch a movie or eat dinners. Like this is so great. And then after a little while, I got the Google slap and it stopped being profitable, stopped making money. And through that process is where I learned how to make a funnel. One of my friends who had a similar business, he messaged me and was like, he had a similar business to mine. And it, it, his, it's kind of stopped working as well. And he called me and said, I figured out, I figured out, like, what'd you figure out? He's like, he's like, I started adding upsells to all my products. I'm going to buy my first product and they would add an upsell. It's like a percentage of people who bought my first product bought the upsell. And I was like, okay, well, how would that work for me? And he was like, well, you're selling the potato gun DVD. Like what, what could you sell for an upside? What's the next thing that they need? I was like, well, if they buy the DVD, they stuff to go to home Depot and buy the, you know, the pipes and the, the barbecue igniter. Like all the stuff, you know, is like, well sell a kit then. And so I found these guys who are making potato gun kits, which I'm shocked. There was somebody making potato gun kits. They part of the ship with them. They started shipping the shipping the kits for me and made it or basically something about DVD. The upsell was a kit and sure enough, I started making way more money from every customer that came through, which made it so like they've survived ads again and it put me into business. So that's kind of how this whole, this whole craziness started. That's incredible. So I mean, and to think through just on that one funnel, how many attempts you were on that one funnel to actually make it profitable. That's a ton. I've watched multiple times sitting down and you'll go through and you go, oh, I remember back in the day, I tried this. Oh, I remember back in the day, I tried this and you'll just pull all these stories of all these attempts you've gone through that either went really well for a while. For some reason, he stopped them or they were like, they taint car, you know, and then you just kept going and trying and trying and just ballpark. How many attempts do you think it was once you knew what a funnel was not not all the ones before that just falls. So it's interesting because of my did is, you know, we did an interview with Andrew Warner from Mixer G, the Drybar comedy club. And so he was preparing for it. He's like, he sent me some of the old, your old funnel sites in the context of your journey. So I was like, I sat down and I spent like two days trying to find them all the way back with she, which is this old website archives old websites and went back to all my domain registrar. See every domain I'd ever purchased and bought and not just domains I bought. This is not like how many domains you bought because that's in the thousands. It's like that's way more. It's how many things where you actually had the idea, built a logo, had a product, put up a web page and a funnel had copy written headline. Like how many of those it was like 120 plus of those that we had gone to execution. I gave him a whole word doc or Google doc that had them all. And it was like eight and a half, nine pages of them. And most of them were back, which you need to see the old pages and he's like, I had no idea. He's got not realized that's how many, how many times she made. I was like, oh yeah, it was, it was every month we launched one or two funnels. And at first I was really bad. It's like first one, bomb, the next one bomb. And this is again, pretty quick. Yeah, like all four click. This is like, I'm in front page designing page that looks really bad because I didn't have use for a page. And then I sent it to like a coder guy. I'm like, Hey, here's like 30 bucks. You turn this like, get this thing online somehow and then make the images show up. And then here's my PayPal buttons. Cause I didn't know how to do those things. And so it was a painful, hard process, but it was like the first one in second, third. And it was crazy cause like most of them didn't work, but everyone's one idea. Like I remember it was my junior year in college. I just, I'd been married to a wife about a year and it was about Christmas time. I had like, I had marginal success. And maybe total, total collected in my, in my, you know, two years during that time, maybe, maybe 10 grand total collected. Right. And I had a little list of customers and it was Christmas time. And I was trying to think of like, how do I get something nice and why for Christmas? And I didn't know. So I put together this little offer. I call it the Grinch sale. I was like, it's the Grinch is so Christmas. And I remember in the copy of the, on the page, I was like, Hey, you know, this goes on my plan. It's my wife and new couch cause she really wants Christmas. I can't afford it now. You said that in the copy. In the copy. Oh, nice. I found the way out to show you. Cool. And yeah, I was like, this is the plan and, and I had a little, I had an affiliate program instead of luckily, like I didn't know the time I had like, Hey, I started to make 30% promoting the Grinch sale. I didn't think anyone was going to do it, but it was set up just in case. So I'm sure I emailed my list of like, I don't know, maybe, maybe a thousand subscribers max, right? Right. Go out there and it's like a $37 offer. And they went up every day. Like went up by 10 bucks or something. So like buy it right now. There's my urgency and scarcity. Cool. Launch this thing. And, and I sold, I don't know, a couple thousand dollars worth. And I was like, this is amazing. And then this guy named Carl Gletti, who was on my list, had a list and he's like, he bought the offer. He's like, this is awesome. He sent it without even telling me sends an email to his list. Like, Hey, Russell Brunson's got this cool Grinch offer. You should go buy it. And anyway, in the three days of this little launch, you did $30,000 in sales, which is, that's more than like my teachers in college made in a year. And I was like, year. Yeah. Three days. I was like, Oh my gosh. Like, I don't even know what to do. I'm freaking out. And so it's crazy is after we close the sell down, I went and I bought the couch and then it took a picture of my wife and I look out and send it out to all the customers. And it was crazy because there's people buying it. I had people mess and like, I'm buying this just because I want you and your wife to get that couch. And like, it was so cool. And that was the first like the first time I made like actual in college, like 30 grand. And, and it was crazy. Because we talked about it. Like it wasn't a business. It was a promotion because after they stopped, there's like no cash. I came in for months afterwards. But 30 grand is a lot of money. It's a rest. It's whole heart of money. It's like, as more of my wife was making it her job. And so it's like, we had time to like relax. She quit her double job. And then, and then I was like, I think, like, what, how do I replicate that? And anyway, that's the, that's part of the journey. That's amazing. So I mean, the show title is one funnel away. You go through hundreds. I mean, you, okay. I mean, there were a hundred actually put together and launched, but I'm sure there were hundreds others that somewhere there's somewhere in the, you know, right before a launch between, you know, buying and actually doing them. I mean, what would you say to people? What was it that I guess for you personally that motivated you to keep moving forward and doing this? Cause that's a lot of tries. And most people have a really hard time doing it after one fails. And you're like, that's not really going to happen. I think most people get stuck with the belief of, of like, I believe it works for Russell or something, but I don't think I can do it. And I was the other way around, like I saw other people doing it. I was like, I remember names, Armand Moore and Alex Mendoza, Marlin Sanders, like Yonix Silver, these are the guys who I was watching. I'm like, they're doing it. Right. And I was like, they're really cool guys. There's no way that they're that much smarter than me. So I just had perfect belief, like I'm going to figure it out. And so it was like, okay, I'm just going to keep trying to work. Okay. Nothing else going on. So I'm going to try this one and this one and this one and this one. And it was crazy. The first couple to do well, but then as soon as it's, um, it's, you have one has a little success. The next one you do has, like, because you're, you're, you're getting customers, I see some customers. Right. And then I remember my very, one of my other big ones, um, uh, my very first software product called zip brand is my first product in like the internet, like the marketing word zip brand or, and it didn't do awesome. But like, it was my first big idea and it made a couple of hundred bucks. And then, uh, I remember I had this idea for a product called form fortunes. I found a program, recorded it, and then I took my little customer list and I promoted form fortunes. I remember my first thousand dollar a day. A thousand dollars in a freaking hour. Like that's more than I made it like multiple months before a thousand dollars a day. And then the next idea was actually was a horrible, it was so stupid, but it was called article spider. I was like, I paid a guy a couple hundred bucks, made this thing called article spider. And then I watched that and then when I did $1,700 a day, I was like, what? And like everything's really got better and better. I think sometimes people think one funnel way means I'm going to million dollars. Like nothing, nothing, nothing. And that happens sometimes. Like train well, right? Yeah. Nothing, nothing, nothing. And then I was like, I'm going to make a list of things. Like, but that's rare. Right. It's usually it's like each one's a stepping stone to the next thing. And the next thing is like, it just starts growing. And eventually like if you keep doing it, like you have customers and people that eventually like your list get big enough where it's like, I was helping people like pushing a rock up a hill, right? And then she gets the top, then it comes back down, boom, the other side. And it starts, it starts growing. So it's just, it's just having fun and believing that you can actually do it. And then not being so stressed out. They're like, oh, this is, you know, I'm going to be successful. Like keep your day job. Do something inside of what you're doing it. So you're not stressed out about money and finances and keep doing it. Have some fun with it and be creative. And then eventually like if you keep consistent with the long enough, eventually it's going to work. I think it's awesome. And I like that even you described it as perfect belief in yourself. How does someone get that? Because I feel like that's the thing that people struggle with. Like you said, the most also. And I've seen that and they'll come in and they'll start creating their first funnel or whatever. It's not like, it's not like the models you're teaching in one funnel way. They're not new. I mean, they've been around a while. They're so, they're, they're a bulletproof. I mean, they've been out there forever. It's someone's execution of the model that they really get messed up on. And how does someone cultivate that perfect belief? I think the biggest problem people have is they go out initially and they're like, they're going to start a business, they excited to tell everyone, hey, my wife, I'm going to be rich. Hey mom, hey, and they tell everybody and then it's like, now all is the pressure. Right? Like, that's scary. You gotta say, if I fail, I gotta tell you, like, it didn't work or didn't work. I mean, I had that problem. I think you know, the same thing where you tell everyone, like, like when I was a kid and when I was collecting junk, the way back in the day, I used to tell my mom and my brother and my sister's like, I'm going to be a millionaire. This one's going to be the thing. I'm going to be a millionaire. I remember them mocking me like, oh, Russell, you a millionaire yet? Are you a millionaire yet? Like, no, like, leave me. I try, you know, and they make you scared to try because that, so for me, like when I am restaurant, my business in college, I didn't talk about it. It was just kind of like my side project is my side hustle. And people ask me, I was doing what I did for a living. I'm just working on subsides. I've kind of learned this online business. I never told them, like, I'm going to be a millionaire. My funnel is going to be the biggest because then you have all the stress and the pressure. Like, instead of like fail quietly because if you fail, like nobody even knows. That's the biggest thing that people understand. Like, if you just put something out there that doesn't work, like, you're only going to know. So there's no stress of it, right? And I think that's the biggest fear people have. Why? It keeps them from taking that step. It's a belief in themselves. But even more so, it's the fear of like, what's going to happen if I fail? I mean, that's, that's a scary thing. It is. And so when you just kind of do it and do it on the side, it's, you know, you don't have the fear of it. It kills all the pressure and makes a way. So, okay. So the one phone away challenge then just some context for people who are like watching and listening, where did the whole idea of one funnel way come from? And then the challenge also itself was two separate things there. Very cool. So, so I've been studying for the last 15 years, all of the marketing grades. And one of the guys, I had a chance to actually interview him once before he passed away, which was crazy. It was Gary Halber. He was, you know, a legend called the Prince of Print. And like, anyway, he's, he's like the, he's like the Babe Ruth of our world. Yeah. You don't know. He's the man. He's amazing. So I had a chance to interview him once, but he had, he had a quote or something said, you're, you're one sales letter away from being rich. And I remember reading that back when I was getting started and being really inspired by like, that's cool. I don't know what sales letter is like and what products I kept like, you know, putting things out. And I still remember the very first product I had that made a million dollars was I interviewed this guy named Vince James, who was a 28 year old kid who made a hundred million dollars through, um, selling supplements through Drexel. It's crazy. And, uh, and I interviewed him and it was funny because I interviewed him. So I wanted to learn from him. And then like two years later, I had this interview, six hour long interview. I was like, I should sell this interview. I never even thought about it. I was like, I always had other ideas and products. And I was like, the interview was really good. I wanted people to buy that. So I sold that interview and wrote the sales letter for it, sold it. And it was my first one that remained a million bucks, my first two comic club before there was a two comic club. And I was thinking, I was like, Oh my gosh, Gary, how it was right. I was one sales letter away. I didn't know which one it was, but that was the one that made me rich. And I had no idea that was going to be the product. And often I'd done a ton between there, but that was the one that made me rich, um, initially. I remember, um, that, that was the lesson for me. And then fast forward now to funnel hacking live, which is our big annual event we do every year. I can't remember if it was, was it the third one? You were there with me. We were writing the coffee. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, um, and I'm trying to think of like, what's the headline for, for the event. And also that I remember that we were one sales letter away from being rich. And I was like, that's cool. I was like, Hey, you're one phone away from being rich. And I remember I wrote that as a headline. I was like, it seems so shallow. Like being rich is like a cool thing. But like just so you guys know, like I'm going to fast forward like two years down your journey. It's, it really doesn't matter. It's cool for like three seconds. And you're like, now what? Now what? I'm feeling as if I thought. Yeah. So I deleted being rich. I'm like, well, you know, I'm like, well, you're one phone being rich. Like what else? Like what's more meaningful? Like where you're one phone away from, I was thinking about our customers. Like, well, some people, they have a boss they hate. So I'm like, you're one phone away from firing your boss. I was like, Oh, that's cool. That's cool for a segment. Because some people, a lot of people that are existing business owners and try to take business to the next level. So I'm like, okay. So I deleted that. Like we're one phone away from more impact in your life. We weren't fine. We had like 10 different variations of everything. And like they're all good, but they were all encompassing. So I deleted it. I was like one phone away. I'm sitting back in my chair just looking at the funnel, looking at it. And I was like, wait a minute, that's it. It's one phone away. Like it's different for everyone. Like everyone, like it's going to mean something different to everyone too. Like for, for you, it might be that one phone away from quitting your job might be one phone away from, from, um, you know, starting a new career from, from growing your business more, like everyone's got different things. So I left it more open. And so I was initially it was, we did our whole, the whole event was themed our one phone away. And by the way, since then every funnel I can live in still has always been theme one funnel. If you guys are like, what's the new theme? I'm like, there's no new theme. That's the theme. It's the promise. Like yeah. Cause everyone's different phase in their life. I had times in my life where I literally was on the brink of bankruptcy and the fun was the thing that turned it around for me. But other times where it's like my new books coming out. It's the thing that got my book into the hands of a hundred thousand people. So I got bigger impact. Like every phase of your life, you're always one phone away from the next thing that you're, you're chasing, right? There's always the next tier, the next thing. And so it's been the theme now for like four years. Maybe we'll change it someday, but I don't think we will. Um, that was kind of the, the thing. And then, um, it's become such a mantra inside of our community. And, um, uh, about a year and a half ago, um, we started geeking out on challenge funnels, things like that. And we did do a challenge for our people because weight loss challenges is how people have success weight loss, right? Like we're going, I'm going to lose 10 pounds. I'm going to do this challenge, new year's challenge, something else. So a finite period of time. Yeah. Push hard. A finite period of time, something, there's a start and an end date. Something, you know, it's hard to like, I'm going to run a business for forever. It's like, if I can give you something that there's a beginning and an end with it, with the 10s were results, like then anybody could do it. Yeah. So we're like, well, what should we do? And it came back to like, um, you have to hope what you did was like, what if we did the one funnel way challenge? And as well as things just like the angels were singing like, that feels so good. This is amazing. And there's so many things like we have people that come into our community from so many different, I mean, we have, you know, I don't think there's many companies on earth that publish more things. You know, it's like this ad or this book or this podcast, isn't it? Like there's so much stuff happening out there that you will come in. And sometimes it's like, I heard this amazing thing. I want to funnel, but you don't have any of the foundational knowledge. So you get a funnel, you get software and you're like, this is awesome, but I don't, I don't know what to do or how does this apply to me? Yeah. And the funnel way challenge is really to take all, like take everybody and take a process where they understand the core strategies, like hook story offer and the fundamentals and how to create a product and like, I was getting offered the difference in product and I offer and like, how do you actually create a funnel? How do you pick funnel? What kind of fun? Like just all the core fundamentals. And so someone comes in, they go through a 30 day process. And by the time they're done, they, they're speaking the same language as they can now communicate to anybody in our community and like be on the same page instantly. And so that's what the challenge is. And we started it initially about a year and a half ago from when we're recording this. And first it was like once every quarter we did it and it was like once every six weeks and now it happens more often because it's become such a big part of it. And you know, way we structure the challenges, you know, it was like, I came in and taught strategically, like here's the strategy of the need to understand. And then Julie Stoing came in and was like, okay, here's the tacticals. I was like, Russell talked about this here, step one, two and like show you in how to actually do it. And then we came in with, you know, kind of touching on both sides of those and also the mindset and like, and pushing, you know, to make sure you guys are successful. We love you guys. Yeah. And then now we've even added on top that we've got coaches who were like full time job is to sit in your group and make sure you are successful. And it's like, it's, it's insane for like, it's like a hundred bucks and it gives you everything to be successful. I'm spending insane amounts of money every month for you guys to come in and have a coach, live coach, answering your questions, making sure like just pushing you long to be successful. And it's been interesting watching over the last year and a half as we've been running these challenges, like people have come to click funnels who don't do the challenge. Their success rate where it is versus people who do the challenging, how much more may make, how much faster they make it, how much more success, like it takes that one funnel way trajectory and like, who like takes it from like, this is my journey to like, this is my journey. It's pretty cool. I'm jealous, frankly, of the people who have been able to, you know what I mean? Like, I went through 15 years to get these principles. I can't for almost free like, it was 17 failures before I knew what a funnel was. And then it was 17 more funnels after that, even though I'm sitting next to you, you know, like think about that, right? This, oh my gosh. Yeah, you guys have such an amazing powerhouse. Such an opportunity. Sitting through feet right there. It's ridiculous. Okay. So you go and you make the challenge and people are, I mean, there's so many people going to tens of thousands. I mean, it's got to be getting close to the hundred thousand mark soon, which is amazing. The impact has been all over the place. It's cool. I see people who've gone through multiple times too. They go through once and it's like, then they're going to go through again for the next funnel or four, you know, to find two in one. They created the first one, but it's like, it's a thing that you keep going through. It's like the fundamentals in anything, you know, like, one of my favorite quotes is from Vince Lombardi said that every single year you come into the locker room the first day, gentlemen, this is the football. This is fun. I feel like this is like gentlemen, ladies, gentlemen, this is the funnel. Let's get back to the foundation. I think sometimes in our world, we get so excited by all the bells, the whistles of funnels, we even get like, when it all comes down to it, it's these core principles that make the funnel work and it doesn't matter as long as you have them. That's the key to being successful. So just like to end here and closing up with it and looking back at what all those principles are, what do you say is like one of the things that is one of the principles just over and over and over again and all the funnels, Hey, if I don't have this, I won't launch a funnel. If I don't have this, the funnel won't even work. That's that thing that people can expect to learn in the one funnel way challenge and it's kind of makes all the difference for you. I think it's one thing about it and kind of go through it backwards. So the principle of hook story offer, which is we throw this whole thing is big. And I think, you know, one of the big differentiations, the thing that makes, there's like a website in the funnel or between non funnel hacker businesses. Yeah, it starts with hook story offer, search the offer. Right. Like most businesses start like, here's my product money to sell. And we're like, no, like you already fell like step one is creating an offer, which again, that we could spend hours. You have three to eventually run that just talk about the offer party. It's so vitally important to understand. It's not difficult, but it's like when you understand that it makes funnels are possible and you have an offer. You can't do a funnel by just having a product. So it's understanding just the psychology of how do you create an offer. We understand that it's like, well, I have an offer and how do you sell it? We need to tell a story. What's the story? How do you tell a story? How do you elicit the emotion you need to be able to get to tell a story to make the offer sexy and exciting? Somebody actually wants it. Right. Now you've got the offer and you've got the story that increases the perceived value of the offer. Then what's the hook she threw out there to get attention? Right. All those are so busy. I can say people are on their phones a thousand miles a day just going a thousand miles an hour on the phone, you know, scrolling through these and their newsfeed. How do you get them to stop? Wait, Steven, you must listen to my story. Look at me. You grab the hook, you stop them. You get them. You have the attention. You tell them the story and then you make them the offer. You put in those principles and then you're weaving that into every step of your funnel. You weave it into your ads, you weave it into your landing page, you weave it into your sales page. That theme, that framework is probably the most essential things we teach in the funnel. It's one of the core things. It's so much good stuff. But, when you when you match that and see how it weaves into every single step of the funnel, then what's cool is when something doesn't work in your funnel you always know it's one of those three things. Yeah. My ads are working. Well, it's either your hook, your story or offer. Ads working. My landing page is not converting well. It's either hook, story, offer. pays 100 grand for a day for consulting and they come in and they're like, my file's not worth your city, I'm like, well, here's the landing page. What's your offer? You're so smart, I'm like, I literally, you can do this at home by yourself and you can now with the one phone away. For a hundred bucks. Anyway, it's so much fun. It's like, I love this game. It's like, every day it's exciting because just looking at those things and understanding the better you get at these fundamentals, you can get anybody's phone on the bank. Oh, I'm sure that you do it all the time now, but all of our one phone away members are getting better at this. Like you'll watch a TV commercial and they're like, oh, this book is horrible. Oh, that story was like, he didn't have any emotion this right. That offer was the worst. Yeah. We're on this cruise and one of the guys in two comic book coaching program, I wonder if I could find it or I'm not going to find it, but he was walking down the boardwalk and there was this sign and it was like a restaurant and they had actual offers. Like, if you come in right now, you can get free drinks. We have Wi-Fi, we have men and women's bathrooms. All of a sudden it was like this stack and the slide was like, this is an actual offer. Every restaurant they come by my hamburger. It's because if you buy my hamburger, you're also getting free water, free drink, bathroom, Wi-Fi. And it was just like, and they're recognizing now too. And it's just fun when you start, when you're aware of the patterns, you start recognizing it. When you start recognizing it and other people, it's easier to do for yourself and it's, it's, it's fun. The game gets fun and moldable and you're like, oh my gosh, this is how it was actually playing. It's so fun. So, but and because of ClickFunnels, you don't have to go through front page and do all this stuff. They have this. Yeah, that you had to go through. Think about this. You guys have a social, I had to bleed funnels. Like it was like, we're typing to our fingers and then like begging people who are smarter than me and paying them to like it's so like, what, two, three months process. And then you go launch it and you don't even know if it works. And that amount of time to go put it out, like, oh my gosh. Yeah. When we were, when we were before probably the three years prior to ClickFunnels, we were on a page where we had launched one really good funnel every quarter. Our costs were being 30, 50 grand per funnel and then about one out of four funnels hit. One out of four. So it was like, you risk failure, failure, failure. Boom. Million dollar winner. You know, and some, and sometimes it was like, it was like, fail, fail, fail, for real fail. Like, like if it fails again, we're done. Like we're out of business. Then like fifth one would hit and right on and nothing, you know, but that's what it was. It was a gamble, but it was like, that's what it was. It's like once a year, we would hope for at least one home run that would pay for the bills for us the year. And so that was like three years of that. It was, it was painful. And so we built ClickFunnels and I could build a funnel in a couple hours. It was just like, oh my gosh, like it's on like Donkey Kong. Yeah. Let's go save, done, launched. I mean, think about it. If you don't know, if you haven't taken the challenge, go to onefunnelway.com to take it. It's a hundred bucks. Okay. It's not to make money. This is for you to go in and actually.
