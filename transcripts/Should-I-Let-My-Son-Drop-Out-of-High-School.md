I need your opinion on something. Should I let my high school senior drop out of school? I've struggled in school. I've struggled with the whole concept behind it. And right now I've got my two oldest, my twin boys, or seniors this year. And one of them though, he's very creative, his mind's all replaced, very similar to me. He's a great people person. Everybody loves him. He's great at talking to people. He'll be great at sales and entrepreneurship. He'll be great at anything he wants to do in life. But he struggles in school. And I get it, I remember sitting in school listening to teacher talk and they tell stuff and then I sit on a test and I'm like, I don't remember any of these questions. I remember just thinking I was dumb. The Holly Smoot Tariff Act, which anyone raised or lowered raised tariffs. But I've gone on to have a pretty successful life and done well. After I graduated, I remember sitting back and thinking about just school as a business model. I remember getting so fresh that I recorded a podcast called The Scam We Call School. It gets ridiculous. It's asking a fourth grader all these questions and nothing to do with anything. I talked about how if I was a started business that was like the most brilliant business in the world, it would be school. I would create an educational system and I forced you to pay for all these modules you didn't actually need. When we call them prerequisites, you have to have them to be able to get your degree someday, even though like who actually needs half of these classes. And then I'd give you the spot where you could get a student loan for school, right? And then those student loans are non-dismissable. Even under bankruptcy. You go bankrupt, you still have to back your student loans. Do you realize that? So if you go to college, you get a degree, you go and get a job with that degree. And then you're supposed to make the money to pay back the degree. But if you can't pay it back and you go bankrupt, you still owe the money on the degree that didn't give you the skills that you needed to actually get a job to pay it off. Like it's a brilliant business model, right? I've got five amazing kids. I love them. They are the coolest in the world. The kids are first born. You're dreaming about their future. What you want for them, you're thinking about all the things you want them to do and to accomplish. I've got twin boys and one of them has been struggling and he wants to drop out of high school. In fact, we just had this conversation today. He and my wife and I is just like, hey, I'm struggling in school. I don't think I'm gonna graduate. And even if I do graduate, then what? He's like, I'm sitting in classes all day and listening to each other talk about who knows what. I can't pass the test. He's like, I'm either sleeping or I'm gonna cheat because I can't get this thing done anyway. And if I want to graduate, it's gonna have to do. He's like, I want to stop and just start life today. I remember sitting down with my kids and explaining to him, I said, look, you have to understand that all things you're learning to score now actually don't matter. Right now I've got almost 400 employees who work from here at ClickFunnels. And I was thinking that right now we've got a accounting team of four or five people who just do all the accounting. And like with what AI is doing, like I actually don't need an accounting team. I don't even need an accountant. All I need is somebody who someday will be able to run the accounting prompts on AI. I was telling them that's trying to be a good parent. Like don't stress about these things because they don't actually matter. Just learn how to learn because you gotta figure out how to learn along the way. So there's that side of it, but other side's like, man, he's making great arguments. Like what is the point of it? He's not learning anything. He's gonna be helpful in life. He's not planning on going to college. He's not gonna become a doctor or an accountant or something that needs a formal education. Like he's gonna go out there and create something. He wants to write music and be an entrepreneur. Like, so I don't know. I always assumed my kids would graduate high school. I even told them, I was like, I encourage you guys to go to college because in college is where things are happening. Go there and try to find your future spouse. Like go and find your future business partner. Like get to know people because as soon as you're making more money than your college professor used to drop out. I could argue both sides of the argument really well. If someone said your kid needs to go to school, I could be like, yes, your kid needs to go to school. They need a worst case scenario. Like worst case scenario that you need a diploma so they can go get a job at McDonald's. They need to understand these basic skillsets. The same time it's like, what are you doing this for? What's the purpose? As an entrepreneur, as a business owner, when someone sends me a resume, I don't look at their high school diploma. I don't tell people in my staff, I want you to be well-rounded to learn everything. I want people who are obsessed with one part of the craft. I want people with the best in the world that they're obsessed with. Not these people again. Literally most of our hiring is based on personality profiling in. And seeing if the thing that they're obsessed with, they're actually good at. Like that's it. One of my wrestling coaches, and he's Von Ivanov, that he was an Olympic silver medalist, one of the greatest coaches I've ever had a chance to work with. He's from Bulgaria. And in Bulgaria, as an athlete, they identify you as a young kid, like, oh, you're really good at this sport. So for him, when he was in third grade, they identified he was a really good at wrestling. And so what they did is they took him from his family, took him to what's called a sports school. They brought him to the part away from his family where they trained him to become one of the greatest wrestlers in the world. The part of him is like, oh, that's so hard because he's not well-rounded, but he was able to figure out this strength and then double down on it and become great. I think more and more kids are leaning towards this type of a thing, but we don't have any precedence of like, oh, kids who drop out of high school because they're pursuing something they're passionate about are X times more likely to become billionaires. We don't know that yet. Like we're too early in this phase of the world, I think, to even know. And so I'm just curious to hear his thoughts. I think in a perfect world, we rewrite the system. Imagine a school where you could come in and that's what it was. It's like, what is your purpose? What do you actually want to pursue? And so I always thought that most of my kids would do that. They'd go to college and that would be their goal. But looking at my son now, and again, he's making such good arguments. Like, well, what's the purpose? Like, let me start my life today. Like, these are great arguments. I need some time to think. And so I'm here thinking with you guys verbally. My wife and I have talked a lot about this, but I would love some of your thoughts. I don't really know what to do. What would you do? What would you do with your kid? What would you do if it's, if this is you, if you are a student right now, what do you think the goal is? So I don't know. I'm kind of in this weird spot where, I don't know the answer. I love my kids. I just want the best form. And it's just this constant thing. Like, you're trying to create a world and an environment for them to be successful. Sometimes we try to push our version of success on them and they fight for it. And I've noticed that some of my kids, and it's hard. I don't know the answer. So I'm looking for your parents. Let me know down in the comments down below. I appreciate you. And we'll figure this out together.
