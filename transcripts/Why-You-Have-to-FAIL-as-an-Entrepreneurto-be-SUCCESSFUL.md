I sit next to this guy, he asked me, he said, tell me your stories. I started to kind of telling the stories. I said, no, I don't want to hear the highlight reel. I want to hear about your... The main, Russell. Pay to sell your product. I love this guy. Love this guy. I honestly believe the entrepreneurs are the only people that can actually change this planet. Hey there, this is Russell again. All right, so I want to tell you a story about why failing can actually be really, really good. Hopefully this is helpful for any of you who are entrepreneurs who have tried to have success and you haven't. Over and over and over again. And it's actually a good thing. I know it seems counter-tutor doesn't make any sense, but I promise you after I hear this, after I tell you the story, it'll make complete sense. So those who don't know my story, I have had a chance to build a business up and then to crash it and then to build it up and then to crash it more than once, right? And remember I was at this mastermind retreat down in Mexico with some of the most amazing entrepreneurs from around the world. Some of the top marketers in fitness and health and supplements and it was really an amazing experience. And one of the nights we were sitting down, we were on this table having dinner and everyone was hanging out. And I remember I was sitting next to this guy and this guy is one of the top consultants in the world. In fact, he charges $60,000 a day to sit down with you and give you some strategic advice. And I'm sitting next to this guy, I'm a little intimidated and we start talking. I remember he asked me, he said, tell me your story. So I started to kind of telling him the story. He said, no, I don't want to hear the highlight reel. I'm like, oh, what do you want to hear? He's like, I want to hear about your failures. And I was like, oh, and he's like, well, actually I don't call him failures. He's like, I call him cycles. And I was like, why do you call him cycles? And he's like, because entrepreneurs who haven't failed, they're going through and they're telling you their highlight reel or like everything's going perfect for him. The problem with that is like when you haven't failed, when you haven't cycled, he called it cycling. He said, the problem is that you still drink your own Kool-Aid. You still believe your own bio. You still think you're the greatest things in sliced bread. He's like, I refuse to work with entrepreneurs who haven't cycled at least once. I said, oh, well, good news. I've cycled multiple times. And so then I told him my stories about the failures and the things that I learned through these failures. One of the big ones I'll share with you right now is I built up a call center. We had like 60 full-time people who were on the phones, calling people, selling different products and services. And it was amazing until our merchant accounts got frozen and people on the phones could not process orders. Now all my sales guys were commission based and as soon as they weren't able to process orders, guess what they did? They all left. And two days later, I walked into a room that was, you know, prior been full of 60 people on phones, selling things, walked in and it was empty. And I had no ability to generate money, to pay the rent, to pay for anything. And I had to walk away from it. And it was a very painful, very embarrassing, very frustrating time in my life. In fact, it was one of the darkest moments of my life. But because of that, I learned, man, I've got to build systems differently. I've got to build teams differently. I can't rely on just people on the phones I got to rely on funnels. And literally this entire world and concept of funnels I do today came on the backside of that failure. And he looked at me and said, okay, now I'd be willing to work with you. I remember thinking, oh my gosh, that's so powerful. And moving forward, I remember prior to that, I was always so embarrassed to tell my stories and talk about the struggle. And I think sometimes it's hard, you know, Brene Brown, I believe said, you shouldn't share your open wounds, but you should share your scars, right? So a lot of times, you know, something's happening, it's painful, you don't have to share it then, but afterwards it's okay to share those downstories. Number one, it motivates people who are listening to you, right? Being vulnerable makes you feel really, really small, but it makes the person who's listening to you feel really, really big. It's a powerful thing, but not only that as an entrepreneur, if you haven't failed, my guess is that there's going to be a time where you're going to crash. And you got to be okay with that, okay? So it hasn't happened yet, it's going to happen. Now, if it has happened, I want you to feel comfort in that saying, hey, look, it's okay if I fail. Now that I know that it wasn't all me, now I know there's other things involved. Okay, for me, it was a very humbling experience, okay? Maybe understand and love and respect the people on my team so much more, okay? Maybe love and understand and respect God so much more. I think it's why it's so important for all entrepreneurs to fail or to cycle. I like the word cycle so much better because it's not nearly as painful, okay? But just like this guy told me, I want to tell you the same thing. I love working with entrepreneurs who have failed, at least ones who have cycled. I've seen that those are the ones who build better things, those are the ones who have more mission, more vision, those are the people who have more empathy, who are better able to build teams, and so much stuff comes from those failures, okay? Just like in anything in sports, right? You lift weight, your muscles get ripped out, it's hard, but then it builds back stronger. Failures are the things that are gonna break you down so you can build you up and you can be stronger, you can be more humble, you can be a better servant, a better leader, and a better entrepreneur, okay? Now I hope that this story has helped you, especially if you've cycled, if you've failed and you're struggling. If not, hopefully it gives you a vision of like, if and when this thing happens to me, it's gonna be okay. Now if this has been good for you, I would love for you to do a couple things. Number one, like the video down below, but then in the comments, tell me a story about when you cycled in your life. I'd love to hear about how other entrepreneurs decide to me, hopefully I'm not the only one that's gone through these, I'm sure that you have as well, and hopefully get comfort knowing the other people who are in this world just like you, have gone through that as well. Also on top of that, after you're done doing that, over here on the side, one of the sides here, there's a video I want you to watch, it's gonna show you guys how to sell anything to anyone. That's the next video in the series, you do that by creating what we call an iris and spaloffer. Make sure you click on the video next, watch that video after you've left your comments down below.
