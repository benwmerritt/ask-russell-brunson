## Transcript
The reason for the festival is obvious. To revolutionize the way we build funnels and the way we look doing it, you know? Nobody wants to be the nerd sitting behind a computer just, you know, like glasses on and cheeto fingers. They want to be on a beach with models. Like, we're changing the way this industry is ramped through the Click Funnels Fire Festival in the Bahamas. We've rented a couple of yachts, two of them, and we're actually filming our promo video right now. Oh, the keynotes. Keynotes are going to be unreal. I mean, we got, you know, Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook, Elon Musk, Tom from MySpace. We're actually friends now. We're going to have a great lineup. The goal is essentially to obviously replace funnel hacking live with a sexier version. I would call this my passion project because I'm so sick and tired of seeing funnel hackers so focused on generating wealth and then having impact on other people's lives. Like, is that really what it's about? No. What about growth and impact on Instagram? Why have real impact when you can have a real fake life? If you don't have followers on Instagram, you're not going to make money. The funnels are great, but social media success is the future. I'm not really worried about costs. I have literally put this whole festival together on the company card. Nothing's come out of my pocket and nothing will. I'm doing this for them. They might not see it now. I haven't told them yet, but when I do, they'll see it. Our saying is when life gives you lemons, squeeze them in your eyes, they'll give more likes. Am I doing this to make more friends? Yes. If it doesn't happen, I mean, it's going to happen. It has to happen. But if it doesn't happen, funnel hacking live, it's a good runner up. We should have a beach. I'm still working through the details, but yeah, it's probably going to be at least 40 feet long. You're going to be plenty of photo opportunities to go out there and to show the world what you're doing. No beach? Like, none. Hey, just give me two seconds. How's that going to work? It's not. It's not good. Okay. How's that not going to work? Okay. Seriously. Okay. We're going to have a beach.
