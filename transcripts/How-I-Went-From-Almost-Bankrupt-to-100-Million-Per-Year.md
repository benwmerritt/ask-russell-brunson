## Transcript
I want to tell you a story about how I went from nearly bankrupt to insanely profitable in a very short period of time. And I think it's something that all the guys can use in your business as well. If you know my story, 10 years ago, we launched our new software company called ClickFunnels. And back then, most people did not know what a funnel was. It was kind of this new technology. We were so excited. And I remember launching into the world and like nobody understood what it was. Nobody wanted it. And it was really frustrating. We got a point where like after two or three months, like nobody was signing up for the trial and we're just like, we're in trouble. We have to shut this down or figure out something else. And about that time, one of my friends, he was doing an event in San Diego and he called me up and was like, hey, will you come speak at this event? I was like, sure, what am I talking about? He's like, I want to talk about funnels and then sell ClickFunnels. And I was like, dude, you don't understand. Like I am begging people to get a free trial of the ClickFunnels and I can't get them to sign up. No one's going to spend $1,000. They don't understand it. And he said, well, you have to because I already have your face on the sales page. People are coming expecting to hear from you. You need to come and do a presentation and sell ClickFunnels for $1,000. And I was like, oh man, is the event is getting closer and closer. I just kind of scrambling. What do I do? I got a particular offer. What could it be? So the first step was creating an offer, which is always the first step when you're creating any new business. Right. What's the offer? I said, okay, what if instead of giving people free trial of ClickFunnels, what if I gave them like a year access to ClickFunnels? That'd be the first thing. I was like, if they have ClickFunnels, they don't know how to use this. What if I created a training course that would teach them how to use this? I created a training course and I called it the Funnel Hacks Masterclass. Right. So that was the course. And so I put together four or five things to add a really good, irresistible offer. And I was like, okay, this offer I believe is worth $1,000. So I have something good that I can sell this event. So that was step number one. I'm going to make them an offer to count the views. Step number two now is that now you have some kind of presentation to sell it. I remember when I first got into this business, man, almost 20 years ago, I went to my very first event. I remember the first speaker got on stage and the speaker did a 90 minute presentation. At the end of the presentation, he sold his product. A $5,000 offer. I remember seeing people all around them jumping up, running to the back to buy his course. I was doing the math, looking back in the room, I was like, five, 10, 15, 20. I was like, he did $120,000 in 90 minutes. I had to make $100,000 my entire life, every year combined. And he did it in 90 minutes. And this is me. I'm sitting in the room. I'm like awkward and shy, introverted, a Russell who never wanted to speak on stage. I became an internet marketer because I wanted to hide behind my computer and not talk to people. Right. When I saw a human being just like me, makes six figures from stage in 90 minutes. I was like, I have to learn the skill no matter what. Selling a thousand dollar offer from stage is a little different than just speaking at a seminar. So I went to Dan Kennedy and Bill Glazer's course and how to do that. Went to Armand Moran's course and I learned from three or four people, really good at selling from stage. I got better and better. Every time I would go, I would watch the other speakers see what they were doing. I'd take the best ideas and the best things from their presentations. I'd weave into mine. And over a decade of doing this, I got really good at speaking from stage. And then 2008 hit, which basically the whole market crashed and live events disappeared off the face of the earth and then zoom came out. And so for the next, you know, five or six years of my life, I started doing my presentation on webinars. After doing my stage presentation, my webinar, literally hundreds, if not thousands of times, one of my coaching clients who came to me and said, I want to learn how to do a webinar the way you do it. Her name was Liz Benny. And with Liz, like I had never taught someone my process before. So I spent the weekend and I remember going through all my webinars, every product, every offer, every course they ever done. I mapped it. Like, what do I do consistently over and over and over again? After four or five days of going through every webinar, I mapped out this script right here and the script has been called now by most of our members, the perfect webinar. And this is, you know, 15 years of me doing webinars, stage presentations over and over and over again. They figured out a model that works flawlessly. I showed that to Liz. She took that and then she did her first perfect webinar and she crushed it. And after people saw Liz, they came back to me like, I want to do a webinar like Liz did and like the way you're doing it. And so I started teaching this over and over and over again. Eventually I taught this to literally thousands of people in hundreds of different markets. I've seen the perfect webinar be successful in almost every market you can dream of. In fact, recently, Cody Sanchez, who's one of my favorite influencers online, she messaged me, she said, I use your perfect webinar pitch and it worked. Even selling VCs. I get is literally the perfect webinar because it's perfect. Perfection. So that's how I created the perfect webinar. And so as I'm going out to this event to sell ClickFunnels, I have a thousand dollar offer and so I went, I took this sheet of paper out, same one that I've been coaching people on. I said, okay, let me just plug in the pieces. And so I literally went through step by step. I plugged in all the pieces. I told the storage for ClickFunnels, made the offer, got to the event with my slide deck and I started giving the presentation. I went through everything step by step, flawlessly following my own perfect webinar formula. And when the presentation was done, it was the first time in my life I'd ever had what's called a table rush where people are literally jumping up and they're racing to the back. People are jumping over tables. I had somebody actually throw their credit card at me. It was one of the most crazy experiences ever. I was like, this is insane. Shut up and take my money. The rest of the story is probably the most fascinating part. As I flew home, I started texting all my friends who had an email list and said, Hey, I did a presentation. This event, it crushed it. I do a webinar to your list to go through the same presentation. And I had four or five people said, sure, I love to. And Monday, we did the very first webinar. I think we had three or 400 people who showed up for the webinar and I went through my same perfect webinar presentation. I went slide by slide, did the presentation and it crushed it. When it was done, I don't remember the exact numbers, but it was around 20 to $30,000 in sales. And I had another webinar booked for like four hours later. And right before that webinar started, I had this idea. It's like a epiphany. I was like, I wonder if there were comments that people left in the go to webinar zoom chat that would give me ideas if they understood things. Right. So I remember exporting all the comments. I was reading it and it was so interesting because there are parts where people get stuck or they got confused about something. And so I'm back to my slides and I knew that everyone's asking this question, the comments, so I addressed that question on slide number three. Right. And over here, people got confused about the offer. So I addressed that in the slide over here and I tweaked the presentation. So the next time I presented it, all those questions were answered. And so four hours later, I did the exact same presentation with those little tweaks and what's crazy is the first webinar, we did 20 to 30,000. The second webinar, we did over six figures, same amount of people because I made those tweaks. And over the first 12 months of ClickFunnels, I did almost 100 webinars live. And every time the webinar is done, the first time we did export my questions, updated my slides. It got to the point where the perfect webinar to sell ClickFunnels was so flawless. I could do it in my sleep. I'd done it so many times, but literally every question someone would have to be resolved before they had the question. And that's how we took ClickFunnels from zero to over a hundred million dollars in record time was by using this perfect webinar script. Now I want to give you guys a free copy.
