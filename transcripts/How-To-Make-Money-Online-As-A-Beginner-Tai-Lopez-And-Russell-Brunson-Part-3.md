Hey, this is Russell again, welcome back to part three of five of this exciting interview with Ty Lopez, who's doing some karate chops on me right here. This is part three of the interview series. Now during part three, we talk about how does a brand new beginner, a newbie, somebody who's never done this before, how do they actually get started? And I'm going to share some really cool startup stories of people who were just like you, who found out what we're doing and because of that, they changed everything. You're going to hear their stories and you're also going to hear Ty's startup story, which is really exciting as well. So that said, make sure you watch this video and be sure also to subscribe down below if you haven't yet because part four of the video series is coming out very, very soon. I want to make sure you don't miss it. So click subscribe and let's get started with the next section of the interview. What would you say is the most for the biggest beginner? I mean, they are a neophyte. They got $1 in their bank account. They never go to website. How do they get started? You've got this book that teaches it. What would you sell? Flashlights? All right. He had a customer sell 20 million of flashlights in two months. It's saying it's really cool. I think the best way and what's fun is you guys are all watching this process, right? You practice this every single day. I practice every single day. The biggest thing is get your phone out and start documenting your process of whatever it is you want to do, right? Every single day in this book, there's a quote from Garrett White. I was speaking at his event today and in the book, he talked about most people are scared because when they get started, they're like, I'm going to start this thing and I'm going to be good at it. I'm going to suck. And the reality is like, when you first start this, you're going to suck, right? But the whole key is like, if you keep doing it, you'll suck less and less and eventually you'll actually become good. And so my guess, if we went back to the snap chats of yours five years before, when did you start this whole game? Like, yeah, I mean, I've dabbled in 2012, 13. You were pretty good for the beginning. 2015. Your first video in the garage was amazing. So that wasn't my first one though. Okay. So that's great to know for everybody. How's that thing as well? How many did you have to do before like one hit? I mean, I really started in 2013 and the big hit was in 2015. Okay. Two years. Yeah. This is amazing. So this is important because you guys are like, oh, this is Tai Lopez, like the big mansion, everything's happening. He's got a million people listening, but like it didn't start initially, right? So one of the guys in here that worked really close with the name is Anthony V. Clemente. He's got a site called the biohackers guide, biohackers guide.com. He wrote this book and wanted to get a message out and just try to buy ads on stuff. Nothing's working. He's like, what should I do? I said, get your phone out and every single day I want you to make one video showing like some weird biohack and the end of it, tell people go buy your book. And he was like, okay. So he's like, what should I do? I'm like, just do any weird thing you want. So he starts like picking a biohack every single day. So one day was like, he put on these lasers in his nose and his ears and he like talked about the biohack and they go buy the. Sharks with lasers on their heads. Laser beam. And he did it. And then like nobody watched the video and it posted on his fan page. I had like two people like his mom and me were it and like nobody listened to it and he's like, this doesn't work. I'm like, it doesn't matter. You're learning your voice. Do it again. So next thing, another one and he did another one and he did it like every day for probably 11 or 12 days and then like that day, like 11 to 12 day, he was kind of bored. He's like, I'm going to make a video called how to biohack your vegetables. And I remember watching it go live and I'm like, did you waste today? There's no lasers. No weird things. There's no like freezing tanks. Like your biohack, it was like put butter in your vegetables. That's how you biohack it. He does this little video and we put like $10 in ads behind it. And for some reason that one hit. Yeah. In a week has 1.5 million views sells like 20 students. So like 2000 copies of his book and he's off to the races. Wow. And after I can make more videos and more videos and he didn't know what we didn't know. That was the message of the market one. We had no idea. We just he kept doing it. He kept doing it until like it worked. And so if you guys are just getting started, I'd like get your phone out every single day. Do a Facebook live or whatever your thing is you're going to do. Pick a product you want. So it can be yours. It could be ties. It could be mine. It could be you don't have everyone product now. There's so many things you can be passionate about. Find some of your path become an affiliate in a mental box. And like this is the great like every time you get your box, do a video talking about it showing what's inside of him. Why are you so excited and just keep doing that consistently and then put like $5 or $10 in ads behind it. And most of the time your message aren't going to hit every once in a while. If you do it right something will the message will hit with your audience and also like you become an override success. Yeah. And that's that's the key. Like I said you were two years and also this that was the first video that just blew up and went crazy. Just you know you get better. I tell people people forget. There's very few things in this world that you do more than once that you get worse at. So you just got to start you get better with progress. Meaning put one foot in front you shoot one time you build one website people are always like tie how can I be sure my first business is my best business. I'm like what's wrong with you. Why would you want your first business to be your best one. That means you have the inability to learn and get better. That means you're basically some Benjamin Button thing you know idiot that you get stupider. You don't get stupider. You get more experience. All right.
