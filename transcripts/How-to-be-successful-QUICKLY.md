What are the pieces of the framework that he taught was really powerful he said? I'm gonna shoot you, I'm gonna charge back on you and now you die. Pay to sell your product. Love this guy. I honestly believe the entrepreneurs are the only people that can actually change this planet. Okay, so you have worked with so many case studies and have had so many clients that have had so much success, but you've also probably had clients that you're like, man, I really wish that I could have helped them more. Or I really wish that they would have been able to have the results that we were going for. So, as a result of all of your experience in all of your years, what is the framework you use to help your clients not just get results, but help them get results in the fastest amount of time? Very good question. Let me sit back because there's one thing I want to address first and then we'll go to the second one. For you guys who are the third funnel hacking live, it's the one that Garrett White was there with his wife and his kids. He was there for that event. And he gave a framework that was really cool, but one of the pieces of the framework that he taught was really powerful. He said that you are a leader, not a savior. I'm a leader, not a savior. This is how to be a marketer. This is how to build funnels. This is how to close. Part one of funnel hacking. Part two of funnel hacking. How to lead. Anyone can learn how to market. I learned how to close. Anybody can learn how to close with enough work and enough time and attention. You will get good at it. It's a skill. It's not magic. Leadership is magical. Leadership is where the art of who you are comes out. But you've got to operate from a belief system and from a story when it comes to who am I? I am a marketer. Who am I? I am a closer. Who am I? I'm a leader, not a savior. I think a lot of times we get nervous because we want to be a savior for our clients. We want to fix them. We want to help them. It was interesting because in his speech he said, here's a problem in the temptation you're going to have running out of here. You're going to want to make stuff up. You're going to want to say things that aren't true. You're going to want to pick up a picture and you're going to want to paint things to be something that they're not because you don't believe that who you are right now is enough to lead. And so you're going to look at somebody else, maybe me or Russ or someone else. You're going to make up a story about who you are, but it's not going to be true. And you're going to tell the marketplace from that place. This is who I am, but they're not going to follow you because it's not true. And so the only people who will show up are people who want to elevate you as a savior and you're going to take their money as a savior. And here's the upside of being a savior. Being a savior, people exalt you for a time. They're like, yes, you saved my life, but they're not going to do the work. And then the flip side of being a savior from the exaltation side comes the what? The crucifixion. Congratulations, savior. You don't get to take one side of this coin. We exalted you for a time and now you die. And now we're going to trash you on social media. I'm going to make your life hell. I'm going to sue you. I'm going to charge back on you. I'm going to do all this and you're going to want to be angry at them, but you know what? You don't get to be angry at them really. You get to be angry at yourself because guess what you did? You tried to save another human being. Russell can't save you, my friends. ClickFunnels cannot save you. I'm not a savior. My job is not to save this person from whatever. My job is to be a leader and hopefully they follow and do my best. Because we put ourselves in another situation and I've been there so many times where you're just like, it's hard and then somebody starts hating the business and you're like, go, I just want these people to have success and it's like, this is a mindset shift that helped me so much when you said that. I was like, oh my gosh, that's true. I need to be a leader and I'm going to do my best and put forth the much effort as I can. But I have to make sure that I'm careful because if I switch back to that, it never ends good. In all of our businesses, the actual thing is not difficult. It's our people's belief that they can actually do the thing. Like that's it. And so it's interesting, I was talking to Frank, he said, the number one thing to decrease churn was he made everybody go through a personal development course for the first 30 days before they had unlocked any of the actual marketing content. He said, if I can then believe in themselves, they can do anything. This stuff's not hard. It's not hard to set up a funnel or whatever. It's just like their internal belief. There's all of these things that are keeping them back from doing the thing. It's getting them the belief. And the belief comes so much from this process of telling them how you learned and earned it. Getting them to believe, you get them to care enough. And then getting them to believe that this is the right strategy. And then getting them to believe the thing and then getting them to believe that they can actually do it. And so it's like that's our job is to give people a belief. And that's why all the story, all these things are so important. And the more case studies, the more stories, the more they believe in themselves.
