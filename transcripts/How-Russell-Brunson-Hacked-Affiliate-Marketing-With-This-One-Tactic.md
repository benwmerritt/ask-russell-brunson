So I learned this whole process from being a stage seller, getting on stage, traveling on the country and doing that. And then after like three years of it, I was actually in the Boise Airport. It was like one o'clock in the morning, I was flying out somewhere, and I'm sitting there in the airport all by myself, and I was sitting there on my phone, depressed, and I was like, this sucks, really bad. I'm like my wife, I just had twins the time, like my wife, my kids are home, I'm flying out again, to go someplace, a bunch of people I don't wanna hang out with, to go do a thing which is fun, and then go back to the hotel room and sit there for like another 18 hours before I get to fly back home. And I was like, I don't want this for my life anymore. And so I texted my wife one the morning, I said, I'm quitting speaking, this is my last time, that she wrote back, yeah, right, love you, see you in a couple days. And so then my mind, the whole rest of that trip was like, how do I stop speaking and traveling? I don't wanna keep doing that. So then it started transitioning to like, well, how can I do this more and more online? And so the time in tele-seminars is a big thing, so we're doing tele-seminars, and then webinars came, and I got better and better at doing it on webinars, but for me, that was the only way it kind of worked was just webinars, right? And the pitch, and everything we went through yesterday was something that's been evolving for the last 10 years for me, and it's kind of like the point where now it's, like there's always little things we're changing, but it pretty much works. That's why we call it the perfect webinar, like it's perfect. In fact, I've had probably four or five of you guys who like, I did the perfect webinar, it didn't work. I'm like, oh, why not? And then they show me, and like, well, I changed this, and I tweaked this, and I'm like, are you telling me, I give you something called the perfect webinar. It's perfect, and then you changed it, like, duh. Anyway, so it's just perfect. It works, like in every market, like we've ever tried it in. So, but recently, over the last, probably year and a half to two years or so, and the first time it happened out of kind of a fluke, I was, one of my friends, Mike Phil, same to me as no one, he was launching a new product, and he wanted us to promote it, and I wasn't going to, but he's like, he's like, when I first got started, he's like my first friend, we got started at the same time, for the last like 12 years, like he's been like my closest friend in this whole business, so he's like, I really need your help, man, we're trying to do this thing, and he's like, we're doing an affiliate contest, and the winner gets a BMW, and this whole thing, right? And I'm like, Mike, I don't want to promote, I don't have time, we're doing all this other stuff, and anyway, so we kind of left it at that, and then he did the launch, and people were coming, and there's leaderboards, everyone's fighting, and all this stuff's happening, and he's like, man, you gotta help, you gotta help, and I'm like, have you ever noticed who's already promoted it, it's kind of too late, and then I think it was like three, three or four days left in the launch before it ended, and he's like, dude, what's it gonna take? Like, just something, and finally I'm like, all right, I'll do that, but there's only one condition, I was like, I don't really want a BMW, but a BMW costs, I think about $50,000 when he had, I'm like, I do want a Cryosana, which is $50,000, if I win, will you buy me a Cryosana instead of a BMW? He's like, dude, you are so weird, and I'm like, he's like, what is it? I'm like, showing the pictures, he's like, so what do you do? I'm like, you get in it and you freeze yourself for like three minutes, it's really cool, anyway, he's like, whatever, if you win, I'll give you that fine, I'm like, cool. So then I was like, okay, well, I gotta promote this, but everyone in their dogs are gonna promote this thing for the last three or four weeks, like everyone I know has already bought it, like how am I gonna come and compete in this short period of time? And I was like, oh, I'm gonna do a webinar, so I had this thought, I'm gonna write a webinar, but then I got to the office and the day went on, and there's so much stuff happening, and it takes for me a couple of days to really do a good webinar, and finally I was like, I don't have time to do it, and he got a message, he's like, oh, you gotta help me, finally got down to like 48 hours left, he's like, come on, man, help me, finally, I was like, goh. And then I had this like pop in my head, I was like, what if instead of like doing all the slides, what if I just opened up Facebook Live, and I just did a webinar like off the top of my head and just see what happens? I was like, that's like the only shot I had left, so I'm like, okay, so I sat down in front of a whiteboard, here's a picture of it, and I was like, okay, what's my one thing? And so he was selling automated webinar software, so this is like, this is not perfect, so this was with like three minutes of prep time, so it's pretty dang good. So I was like, okay, what's the one thing I gotta even believe, I gotta even believe that the webinars are the future, so how to make that sexy, how to make at least, I think it's, how to make at least eight figures a year without, with this new webinar model, so I'm like, okay, so I wrote that on the whiteboard, I doesn't know one thing, what are my three secrets? Okay, what's their fear about that? And I wrote down secret number one, and I wrote down that. What's their internal fears, and okay, and secret number two, I wrote that down, wrote that down, and I said, okay, if they buy for me, for someone else, what should I give them? I'm like, okay, here's my offer, I wrote down this, and I wrote down all those things there, and then I took a little piece of white paper, and I covered up each of those little things, meldings like cutting paper, and taping them in the back, and we're taping them up, and then within like five, 10 minutes, we're like, okay, we got the webinar, and I was like, I can't remember if it was Brent, whoever had it, we had one phone on Facebook Live, one was on Periscope, and they stood there, and they went, clicked, and they started it, and I was like, hey everybody, welcome to the, to this Facebook Live, and I just did the whole thing, and I'm like, I'm gonna talk about the, and I talked about that, and I make secret number one, and I talked about it, secret number two, and I talked about it, secret number three, and if you sign up right now, you're gonna get, and I pull off the thing, you're gonna get this, and you're gonna get this, and I did the whole stack, and whole everything, I think it gonna be in 26 minutes, in like 32 seconds, was my entire time, and it ended, and I was like, whoo, am I ding? I was like, did anybody buy yet? And then they, I don't know, it's logging, it's logging to Philly Count, and sales are like, doon doon doon doon doon doon. And so then John jumps on, and he's like, man, sales are coming like crazy, so he started boosting it, and over the next 48 hours, we had over 150, 160,000 people watch this, we did over $250,000 in commissions, and I won a cryo sauna, which was awesome. Yeah!
