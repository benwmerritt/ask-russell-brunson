One of the things that a lot of people who want to be successful in any area of life, this is true in sports, this is true in business, they struggle because they don't have enough confidence. I have a dream, I have a vision, but I'm not confident I can actually do it. How do I actually build confidence? And so during this video, I'm going to share with you the five step process I use to grow confidence myself. And so these are things that have helped me the most and hopefully they'll help you as well. Before I jump into the five steps, I want to tell you guys a quick story. So there was a video I used to watch every single day growing up as a wrestler. It was Dan Gable talking to his wrestlers and he said something so powerfully said, I will not allow a wrestler to step on the mat unless they know they're going to win before they walk out there. They step on the mat knowing they're going to win. They step into a business knowing they're going to be successful. Like that's the key is actually being confident. So the question like, how do you how do you do that? Right? It's hard. Like if I was already successful, of course I'd be confident, but if I'm not confident, like how am I going to be successful? So it's kind of this weird chicken in the egg. And so I'm walking through again, five steps to help you to get the confidence you need to actually be successful. So step one is understanding that the reason why most of us aren't confident is because we've lied to ourselves over and over and over again. Now this is something I never caught until last year. I was at an event and I brought on stage one of my favorite people in this world, Myron Golden. And he dropped this one line that just shifted everything for me. You're the only person in the world who's ever heard every lie you've ever told. And so when you think about the fact that you've heard every lie you've ever told, one of the things you have to do to develop confidence is you must become a person of your word. Most people don't trust themselves because they've broken their word to themselves so many times in the past they can't believe a word they say. Become a person of your word. The reason why we're not confident is because we know the lies we eat telling ourselves. We told ourselves we're going to wake up at six o'clock this morning and get out of bed. And then when we didn't, our brain's like, oh, he doesn't keep his commitments, right? And so eventually your subconscious mind's like, I don't trust this person just because he tells me something does not mean it's going to happen. You sit on a throne of lies. And so number one, if we want to become more confident, it starts there. It starts as if we cannot be lying to ourselves. So that brings me step number two, which is called making and keeping commitments. Now most people really get at making commitments. Once again, I'm going to commit to wake up at six o'clock in the morning. I'm going to commit to start my diet tomorrow. I'm going to commit to writing a book. We all really, really get at making commitments. The thing that most people can do is they can't keep commitments. Now I had a chance, man, 20 years ago now to go on a mission for my church, we used to go when we knock on people's doors. The person opened the door and we say, hey, can we share a message with you about Jesus? And they would say yes. And then we share a message and then we give them an assignment. I'd say, I want you to read the description of this book. I'm going to come back tomorrow and see what you thought about it. The person says, yes, they make a commitment. Yes, I will do this thing. I come back the next day and my whole goal is to see, did they actually keep the commitment? The majority of time, 90% of the time, the person's like, oh, I forgot. Oh, I got busy. Oh, and they don't keep the commitment. But 10% of the time, the person does keep the commitment. He said, yes, I did that. And the people who would make and keep commitments would progress through the process. Okay. The same thing is true for you. The reason why you haven't been successful so far, the reason why you're not confident is because you've been making commitments but not keeping them. Okay. So your brain doesn't believe you. So you have to become someone who makes and keeps commitments. Okay. That means if you make commitment, I'm going to wake up at six o'clock tomorrow morning, you have to keep that commitment. I can't lie. And if you do that over and over and over again, it's like a muscle. You get stronger and stronger and stronger at the point where your mind says, man, if Russell says you can do something, he's going to do it. So that's how you start flexing this muscle to start building up your confidence. Step number three is you have to believe. Okay. There's a really good book called The Magic of Believing by Claude Bristol, which is all about like the fact that if we believe we're going to be successful, we can be successful. But the problem is most people don't actually believe that. They hope for it. Like, oh, I hope I can have that. Right. But they don't believe it can actually happen. Like, oh, it happened for Russell, it happened for so-and-so, but I don't believe it can happen for me. Okay. If you don't believe you're going to be successful, you're not going to be it. I remember I started my business, I looked around, I said, all these people having success online. I was like, these people, they can't be that much smarter than me. Maybe they are, but I'm as smart as the next guy. Like, I believe I can be successful because I believed it. I went on and I was actually successful. Same time I see some people come to my world and I go, Russell, you're so smart. That's why you're successful. I don't believe I can do it. And guess what? They did not. Right. As soon as they have that doubt, it's hard for me to be successful. So The Magic of Believing, one of my favorite quotes is this, strangers that sounds, we usually get what we anticipate. So do you anticipate yourself failing or do you anticipate yourself succeeding? You anticipate if you believe it, the likelihood of it happening is so much higher than if you believe it's not going to happen. Step number four is how you attack the situation. If you want to be confident, you got to act like a confident person. I remember the very first time I went to Tony Robbins on Leesa Powerthin event. He talked about physiology, like your actual physical body. He said, look, if you walk into a room and you want to change the world, you walk in like this, and you come over and you talk really quiet and your shoulders are slumped, do you think you're going to be successful? Do you think you're going to motivate people and inspire them? No, he says your physiology has everything to do with the like how people perceive you. So you get to change your physiology. If you want to be successful, like you need to stand like how successful people stand. If you want to change your life and you want to be more assertive, get around more assertive people and model them. Take on their posture and move. If you stand that way for two minutes, like Superman, Wonder Woman, within two minutes, the testosterone in you, male or female, increases an average of 20%. And the cortisol, which is the stress hormone that stresses you out, drops 15% in two minutes. Like I've never seen someone successful looks like this. You walking like this, it changes everything. Like put your shoulder back, breathe heavier, have more like energy, have more excitement, like more facial expression. Like your physiology will dramatically affect the outcome because it dramatically affects your confidence. All right, step number five is you have to detach failing from being a failure. One of the things that keeps people from moving forward and being confident is they're so afraid that if I fail that I am a failure, that they don't take the steps forward they have to take, right? They don't have confidence because like, man, if I mess up, then what happens? When I first started wrestling, it wasn't very good. So I walked out into the mat in front of everybody. Everyone's watching me and I lost and it was embarrassing. It was like humiliating, but I came off. My dad's like, cool, let's watch your film. This is the change you make when we go back and we try it again. So like in my wrestling career, I lost tons of times, 10, 20, 30 times I lost in my wrestling career. But because I got so used to failing, I didn't say that I'm a failure. Instead, I will go back to the drawing board, look at the film, make the adjustments and come back and be successful. Because I did that for eight years of my life, 10 years of my life as a wrestler, I didn't look at failing as failure, right? It was just data. Like failing is the most data-rich source of information we have. So by failing, you actually get the information you need to become more successful. With that said, that's how you can have more confidence in everything you're doing. You guys, those five steps, if you start doing those today, overtime is going to build that muscle up, you're starting to feel more confident. And if you're more confident, you'll help you to be more successful. And you start pursuing a business or a job or a relationship or everything might be the difference between someone who's doing okay and someone's a champion with an extra 20% having that confidence when they enter any situation. So I hope that helps. Thank you guys so much for watching. We'll see you guys on the next video.
