Hey, this is Russell Brunson for all you guys who are just tuning in right now We are doing a show we're answering your number one questions about growing companies building funnels driving traffic making money And a whole bunch of other fun stuff today's question is about business failure What are your top rules for avoiding business failure and what was your biggest mistake? I got so many big mistakes. I get share But the top rules for avoid avoiding business failure I would say If you look at a business there's some for some reason I don't know if it's just me But I think most people get into business. They think it's like this weird thing Right, we go to business school and we go to all these things I remember taking business classes and they taught me all sorts of weird stuff They didn't make any sense to me right like supply chain management and Just anyway, I can't even remember most of my schooling if I'm if I'm up completely honest yet I build a huge company because most of things don't actually matter and you start thinking about like what actually matters in business the number one thing and Most people aren't gonna tell you this the number one thing really is Relationships I Wish that in my business class they've had a class. They just said this Russell This is the deal people do business with people they like so you should become someone first off that people like and second I'll find other people and be really really nice to them Okay, now this is tough sometimes because a lot of times you'll get in business You'll be working with people and you have somebody who will treat you so bad and you look at them And you'll want to do what I want to do sometimes and just like pound their face and destroy them because you're So angry, but we have to understand is that no matter how somebody treats you in a business relationship You always have to keep no matter like No matter what happened you have to keep a good relationship. I'm gonna share a story I'm not gonna share names because I don't want to do that But there was somebody when we were first launching click funnels who was a close friend and a partner We've done a bunch of partnership projects in the past and when click phones came we're about to launch it He actually stepped back and came back to me like oh the day before we launched it. Hey, sorry I decided instead of like Instead of being a partner with you and helping you sell this I'm actually gonna be a competitor of yours and I'm really really sorry and I remember being so Frustrating angry and upset and I wanted to just like fly to his home and like, you know rip his arms off and whatever I don't know. I was not happy at all and instead I was like, you know what? I need to maintain this relationship because I've no idea what could happen in the future He's been a good friend up this point Maybe you know whatever I'm just gonna bite my tongue and so I just wrote back said no worries to understand good luck in the future And hopefully work on something later and I just stepped back and I'm so grateful I did because about a month and a half later He came back said, you know what that thing fell through and I apologize I should have thought through this and I was just being sure side I got excited about the opportunity whatever he said For you forgive me and I was like, yeah, totally cool. He's a sweet and he came back and for about two years He was our number one affiliate inside of click funnels and I'm so grateful I didn't burn that relationship. So have relationships and no matter what happens I dropped my red one, but I need it because we're about to build a fire. Do not there's my log And there's the fire. Sorry. I wish I was better at drawing But do not burn the relationships keep them alive no matter what because you never know When that person could be useful to you and when you could be useful to them as well Okay, so that's that's the top rule is understanding that the relationship is the key number two focus on your List build your list build your list build your list. I remember I got started 15 years ago For those who've been around that long you may remember in fact, my first mentor's name is Mark joiner and Mark is amazing and I remember he would always tell me like Russell got to build a list I was like why he's like you got to focus on building a list That's the key to making money online And so I started building my list and first I you know a hundred people drew my list and then a thousand and then 5000 it was growing really slowly and then about that time is when adsense came out this 15 years ago Some of you guys remember adsense It was like you could make these garbage websites throw up these little Google ads on it and Google ranked these sites really really high and so we clicked on it you get paid I had friends making you half million dollars a month by just making garbage sites And I'm like this looks way easier like I don't have to do anything I just got to make garbage I get paid and mark was like no focus. He's like that's gonna go away He's like they always do like just focus on building a list focus on building a list focus on building a list I'm like, but there's so much money right there. He's like no focus and so I focus on building my list and I'm so grateful I did one of my friends told me the the metric and this metric doesn't hold true all the time But for the worst case scenario you should average one dollar per Month per name on your email address on your list. Okay, so for example when I had 500 people on my email list I was averaging about $500 a month when I had a thousand people on my list. I was averaging a thousand a month We had to ten thousand on my list ten thousand a month I got to a hundred thousand I was averaging a hundred thousand a million a million month like it sink pretty close now the better you are Building relations to your list the more that'll got some people I know make five six seven eight ten dollars per month per name on the email address list So we go up and down that's like the worst case scenario, right? So I was focusing on building this list I got to five hundred and a thousand and ten thousand and about that time is when ads since crashed and Friends I had make it a half a million dollars a month went out of business overnight and they were done and luckily for me I had this list I had this asset and I was able to keep emailing this list and keep growing it Right and this list got bigger and bigger twice in my business I almost went bankrupt two times and I say almost because both times I should have been bankrupt by any Like I did some stupid things we made some bad mistakes the market shifts all sorts of reasons and excuses But but looking at a paper I should want bankrupt both times and both times I didn't because of my list my list came through and saved my butt when like everything was crashing around I had no more money no more employees falling around like how do I keep doors open? I was like I need to make a really good offer my list and I thought that what can I create for them? And I create an offer I emailed my list out and money came back in so focusing on the list is number two and Then number three is No shiny Objects Which kind of ties back into this list right here go back to the fundamentals, okay? There's always needs to popping up. I remember when Amazon first hit a couple years ago It's like oh everything on Amazon and people at Amazon it was awesome They get up and Amazon's just slapping you and kicking you out and then it was like oh e-commerce here And then oh had sense and like people been jumping as long as I've been doing this game 15 plus years people been jumping everywhere The only thing that's been consistent through the ups and the downs are the fundamentals What are the fundamentals if you read the dot-com secrets book these are the fundamentals here is how you build a funnel Here's how you attract customers into your funnel here's how you communicate with those phones with those people Here's how you do like this is the fundamentals of how you build and grow a company Okay, so focus on the fundamentals don't get distracted by the new shiny object focus on the fundamentals What kind of product am I creating how am I selling that product? How am I getting people to show up? That's all funnels if you look at like if I simplify this down like to like the easiest thing possible this is all Businesses right number one creating a product or an offer so here's like here's the thing I'm selling and make sure it's awesome then I got to figure out some way to actually sell that product What's the sales message and then I got to figure out to get people? Over here to come and see the sales message get people come see sales message And then I make them really good offer and they give me money That's the fundamentals of business Okay, that is a funnel and so those are the fundamentals like if I was you guys out focus on nothing but the fundamentals How do I build a funnel? How do I grow my list? Like how do I do this over and over and over again because things are gonna shift Mark Zuckerberg someday as nice as he is right now Tomorrow he's gonna kick a bunch of us out right say this can happen on YouTube on Facebook and Instagram like the platforms are gonna change But the fundamentals don't so focus on the fundamentals and that is the biggest thing to make sure you don't have failures And so you can avoid all the big mistakes that me and a lot of people have been watching over the last stick in the half Have had when they've tried to play this game.
