Hey, this is Russell Brunson, and I got a really cool tutorial if you haven't walked through seven different sales funnel marketing tips. I wanted to give these to you guys because if you have a funnel that's not making you money yet, it's usually not a big thing. It's usually one of these little tiny tweaks you've got to make. So I'm going to walk you through seven tips that you can add any of these seven to your funnel to make more money, have more success, with that said, let's jump into the tutorial right now. Now, if you don't have a sales funnel yet, that's OK. This is going to give you the idea of just like, oh my gosh, I could do this. I could do this. I could do this. If you do have a sales funnel that's not doing that well, these seven tips are going to give you ideas how to tweak them and change them to make it even better. So I'm going to jump right into them right now. As you guys are hearing, I want you to vote down below, what is your favorite tip? Number one, you need to add more curiosity to your headlines to increase conversions. These are some of my friends, Mike and AJ, they're in my inner circle. And what's interesting is they came in the inner circle, and they're like, Russell, we have this webinar, and it's sucking. I'm like, what do you mean? It's horrible. Right now, we're spending $24.85 to get somebody to register for the webinar, and only 22% of people actually show up. How do we fix our webinar? And I was like, I don't even touch your webinar, because I'm just going to tweak one little thing. I said, when I read your headline, it says, how to add six figures to your web design business by copying my secret method for helping companies get more real five-star reviews without spending a lot of time and money. I said, when I read that, I know exactly what the webinar's about. Your webinar is going to show me how to get reviews for local customers. And if I'm like, I think I know how to do that, I'm not going to show up. I said, that's why your ad cost is so expensive, and that's why your show operates so low. People are like, I'll register, but I think I already know, so I'm not going to make it that important for me to actually show up. If I said, all you got to do is just add more curiosity to your headline, just don't tell me what it is, tell me what it's not. The more curiosity I have, the more likely I am to actually show up. And so he changed that. And all he did to this entire webinar is he just changed the headline. So here's the old landing page. Here's the new one. Now, the headline says, how I added six figures to my web company by adding this one easy to offer service that doesn't require cold calling, spending lots of time, money, or required extra resources. And it's not Facebook ads, not SEO, email marketing, website, social media, graphics, and digital marketing, photography, or video. Register now and find out what it is. All he did is just ramp up the curiosity. You're like, what is it? I know what it's not, but I've no idea what it actually is. You know, the increase in curiosity makes people freak out and guess what happened? Two amazing things. Number one, their ad cost went from, do you remember what it was before, from $24.85 to $5.84. Okay? The ad cost dropped dramatically down, and then the show up rate went from 22% to like now over a third of the people are like, I gotta find out what it is. Number two, you need to grow your list by using a lead magnet. So what is lead magnet? Okay, you guys have all seen lead funnels before? It's a funnel, someone comes on a page, you're like, hey, I'll give you this really, really cool thing if you give me your email address. And then they give you email address, and then you give them the cool thing. And then from there, you push them to the next page in your value ladder. What's the next thing? The very first time I ever learned about lead magnets, and I want to show you guys the store because I think it'll give some of you guys a ha, was back almost 15 years ago. It was a guy who's become a friend now, his name's Evan Pagan, he owned a company called Double Your Dating. And I remember he was one of the very first people ever to have a landing page like this, we call them squeeze pages. And I remember coming to this page, I was so confused. It says, you're about to learn secrets that most men will never know about women. Inside, you're gonna learn the kiss test and how to tell if you should be ready to be kissed and much other things. And we're looking at this page and I was like, this is the weirdest thing I've ever seen. And a lot of you guys have seen pages like this, but 15 years ago, I was like confused. And I remember I was at a marketing seminar with some guys that said, yeah, this page right here, this company is $20 million a year online. And this was like the homepage of the other side. I was like, what? Doesn't make any sense. And he said, yeah, they drive all the traffic here, they get a list and then they sell the person other products and services on the backend. And I remember I wanted to funnel hack it and go in, but I had just gotten married to my beautiful wife, Colette, and she would have strangled me if I had signed up for a dating list. So I called her up, I was like, Colette, I'm doing some market research, I need to opt in this thing, are you okay with that? I'm gonna get emails, but I'm not wandering, I'm just trying to figure out the marketing behind it. And she's like, okay, no worries. So I went and I subscribed to find out what in the world is the kiss test they're gonna tell me about. So I put my email address in and it took me this next page. And there's like two or three paragraphs that teach the kiss test. It wasn't like a 55 minute video or a 39 page ebook, it was like two paragraphs. And basically I said, okay, this is the kiss test. You walk a girl to the door, okay? You talk into them, you reach up and you touch the tips of her hair. If she pulls her head back, I mean she does not wanna be kissed, like don't kiss her, like run away. But if she turns her head into you, that means she's into you and she wants you to kiss her. And I was like, oh my gosh, that's the kiss test. And then after that, Lauren on the page says, okay, if you like that, you should go read my book called W Your Dating, click here, and then people go buy the book. Number three is build your sales pages for optimal conversions. Okay, this is something that I assumed everybody understood until I shared it with my team and they were all like, what? If you look at, when we sell anything, there's three phases of selling. The first phase is emotion. That's why I tell a story, you all emotionally engage and the majority of people will buy off of motion. But some people like emotionally you sell them and you're like, ah, but then they start logically trying to justify it, right? So we start with emotion, then we shift to logic and then we move to urgency and scarcity. People who are fear-based, like you just have to push them over the edge. If you look at any sales presentation that I do, you always see this, you'll get an email sequence I do, I always do this, right? The first email is a very emotional base. The second email is a logical base. The third email are urgency and scarcity and fear-based. Every sales process, every sales funnel we take people through, we take them through the same journey, from emotion to logic to fear. So a lot of people understand is I do this accent thing on the actual landing page. If you go to any of my pages, like here's the dot com secrets book, right? Or the expert secrets book, any of those books. This page here, the whole top section is all focused on emotion, okay? The hook is emotional, the video is emotional, everything here is like emotion. That's my best selling technique is emotion. So the top third of my page is all focused on emotion, okay? And for the majority, if you put like a heat map on this and you watch it, like 90% of people see that and they go and they buy, right? All emotional buyers are like, I may as well go do this thing. Okay, but then you have the next group, the logical people, right? They're mostly like, I want this, but like, does this really make sense? Does it go okay for me? And they start logically trying to justify everything, right? So what happens is that those people, like they need more information, they start scrolling. So then they start scrolling the page and they go down a little bit further. And that would start having these things where we logically, okay, the second section is logically, you give all the logical arguments, like you're gonna learn this, you're gonna learn this, you're gonna learn this, logically understand that you need this to grow your company logically. And like we speak to the logic of somebody in the second section, okay? So my scrollers are my logical buyers. So if you watch your heat maps, you'll notice during this section, people are scrolling, a bunch of people start buying, these are your logical buyers who are like, okay, that was the thing I needed right there to get me to go and buy, okay? Then you scroll even further, then I moved to the last thing, which is urgency and scarcity, okay? Some people just, they have to be pushed over the edge. Like they need that last little push. The last bottom page is all focused on urgency and scarcity. This is why you need to buy it and why you need to buy it right now, okay? So whenever your urgency and scarcity limits are, some people it's like, you only have X amount of the product, some of it is the timeline, like I don't care what it is, you gotta figure out a true real urgency and scarcity to push people over. And that is how we structure a sales page, emotion, logic, and fear. All right, number four, offer an order form bump to increase sales. This is one of the things that seems so simple now, but literally 10 years ago when we kind of discovered this, changed all of our businesses forever, okay? The order form bump, I want you to visualize, imagine you're at the grocery store, right? And you gotta go buy some stuff. So you're at the grocery store and you're buying hot dogs and ketchup and buns and chips and you're doing all the stuff for the big game coming up. And then you're checking out the checkout stand. And as you walk into the checkout stand, you start looking, you're like, oh, National Enquirer, like the world's largest baby, that's hilarious. And you grab it and you throw anything, you're like, oh, tic-tacs, my breast thinks, the orange ones taste really good. So you grab some tic-tacs and some gum and a Snickers bar and like the things you're grabbing as you're checking out. That is your order form bump. So somebody comes to my pages and they go and buy something, they're buying some stuff and for years we would just sell them the product. We might have upsells and downsells, but somewhere along the line, I saw a page that somebody had, it was a bigger company and they had this thing. And what happened is right after somebody puts in their credit card, and this is essentials, after they put in their credit card, but before they click the submit button, they have this little block right here that I started calling up an order form bump. The key is after somebody puts in their credit card, before they put in the thing, you have an offer that's really quick there for $17, $27, $37 and impulse buy. If it's something that needs to be explained over like 10 paragraphs, it's not the right thing. If you're selling a book like, hey, do you want the audio book? Or if you're selling like a training course, like hey, do you want the templates? Like it's got to be an impulse buy that you add right there. And in most of our funnels, the profit that comes from this covers our ad spend. It covers the Google ads, the Facebook ads, whatever that thing might be. And so it's one of the most powerful, little ninja stealth things you can add to any funnel that literally will cover all your ad costs. Now everything else you sell in the funnel becomes pure profit. It all comes down to this one little block right here, the order form bump that happens between the credit card number and before the submit button right there. And it is magic. Number five, as we're creating upsells, this is one of the biggest problems people make when they have upsells. Somebody who's buys your product and you have the upsell page, right? What the biggest mistake most people make is the upsell page happens and they say, thank you for your order. We have received your order and they close the loop. As soon as you do that, your conversions on whatever happens afterwards will dramatically decrease. And this is based on thousands and thousands of tests. The goal on the upsell page, you have to keep the buying loop open. So if you notice any of my upsell pages, they ever say like, thank you so much for your order. It always stops and says like, wait, your order's not yet complete, don't shut this page down. I've to keep the buying loop open. Like it's not done yet. We need to customize your orders. You want to add some other cool things to your order before we close this thing out. I do not close the loop. I keep it open during the upsell process. Okay, I've had people before who come to us for consulting and like they have this upsell and the only thing we change is from like, thank you for your order. It's like, wait, your order's not yet complete and increases conversions dramatically. Number six, after someone goes to your funnel and land on your thank you page, you can create what we call an offer wall. And an offer wall is how you can push people into your other value ladders. So for example, listen right here. This is the thank you page for buying one of our products. And down below it says, oh, by the way, here's another cool stuff you could join our funnel university, you get a dot com secret book, you have a split test book, and all this is free traffic that comes to you. Okay, so Aston's gone through your sales funnel and they land on your thank you page. Don't think that they're done buying. What typically happens is that for a lot of people, especially the hyperactive buyers, they're like, this is awesome. And they start looking for more stuff to buy. And they buy from your competitors and other competitors. Like you lost them. So why not just allow them to continue with you in the process? That's number six. And I got one more, you guys are ready for the last one. What we do is we add a webinar to the thank you page to increase sales. So if you look at a bunch of our funnels, the very last page is like, thank you so much for ordering the product. Now I want to start your training right now. Okay, the products being shipped in the mail, you're going to get it. We're going to start right now, we're going to get into business and we start teaching right away. And this thank you page is the webinar. Now a percentage of all the people who buy one of our free plus shipping books start buying our $2,000 product we sell at the back as well. And that is what a thank you page webinar is. All right, I hope you love those seven different secrets. If you like those, please let me know in the comments down below and I will give you some more.
