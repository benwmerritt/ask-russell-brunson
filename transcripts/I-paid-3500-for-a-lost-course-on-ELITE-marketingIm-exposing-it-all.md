Throughout history, like Steve Jobs was the best at doing this, right? If you look at like when he came out with the iPod initially, he wasn't saying, hey, I have a better way. Like right now you get, you can get 50 songs on, you know, typically CD has 10 songs. He wasn't saying there's, you know, now we've created something we can get 50 songs on a CD. He was like, no, no, no, it's like CDs are dead instead. And he pulls out his pocket. Boom, the iPod, right? Dozen years later, he comes out not just a better phone or different phone. He comes out like, like every now and then phone calls, we have boom, it was a new opportunity, right? A new category was created. And by doing that, that opens up the whole world to you, right? When you become a category of one. And so when you create a new opportunity, that's how you grow. That a new opportunity will outconvert any improvement offer all day long. And so most people struggle because they put themselves in a category with a whole bunch of other people and you see it all day long. Like mine's better, mine's faster. As opposed to saying, well, it's a new opportunity I can create that's different. Like that's the key to being successful. Hey, this is Russell. Welcome back to Mind Vault. Today we're going deep into an actual vault from my mentor, Dan Kennedy's company. I bought this company a couple of years ago and I had a chance to kind of go through all the like 40 or 50 different courses. And of all the courses, this is one that I bought in 2011-ish and it completely changed, like radically changed my business, changed my life. I know it's not an old book like we typically talk about, but it is an old course from the man himself, Mr. Dan Kennedy. This course Dan sold for, I don't know, a decade or so for $1,500. As you probably know, I bought Dan Kennedy's company for multiple seven figures. I don't think I'm allowed to say the actual price. I think I was in my NDA. So I don't know exactly, I can't say exactly what we paid for, but I bought his entire company and got this course and other ones. Again, this one was my favorite. And the reason why is there's one core thing that he taught in here that shifted everything for me. And I'm going to explain how it works. If you look at how people create offers throughout time, there's different levels. Right? The very first level is what's called repair. So, right, repair. And so if you think back, like go back to like the late 1800s, early 1900s. Back in the day, like entrepreneurs, for most people, they didn't have the cash to go and like go and start a car company or selling washing machines, those kinds of things, right? So they were the big brands that would create the first version of products, right? And so for entrepreneurs, the way that we built companies back then was all about repair. Like you had a car that was broken, we're going to repair it, we're going to fix it, right? You had a dishwasher that doesn't work, we're going to repair it. And that was like the first version of entrepreneurs that came out where people were all focused on repair. And so everybody who had created offers, the offers were all about repair. That was kind of the first version. Then fast forward over the next, you know, a couple of decades, the next phase inside of business after repair was called improvement. Okay? And this is, I remember when I was going to high school and learning business in school, this is what they always talked about, right? In fact, you probably have heard people talk about like, if you want to be successful in business, find something to build the mousetrap and you just got to build a better mousetrap, right? That is what an improvement offer is, okay? And so repair means, like, if you want to, let's talk about the analogy as a car, right? So if I'm in the repair business, then someone's got a broken car, I'm going to repair it. Okay? And improvement is you have a car, I'm going to give you a better car or a faster car or whatever. Usually if there's an ER behind it, like better, faster, stronger, smarter, and then there's an ER when you explain your offer, then it's called an improvement offer, right? Now improvement is better than repair. Okay? You can make more money selling an improvement offer than you can repair. And again, most people, I'd say 95% of businesses on the internet today are all creating some version of an improvement offer. In fact, I'm curious. I'd love for you in the comments down below to explain what you do and see if you use the words ER. Like I'm kind of like Uber only faster. I'm kind of like, uh, I'm kind of like, you know, whoever, like Tony Robbins only. I'm, uh, I'm for a younger demographic or whatever, like wherever your ER is, that means it's an improvement offer. So again, it's better than repair, but, um, there is something that's better. Not so Dan talks about an opportunity concepts is instead of going to repair or improvement, the third version, and by far the best, instead of getting cut off here, uh, is what's called a new opportunity. Okay. And this is the third and the best. So if repairs, like you have broken car, we're going to fix it improvements. Like there's the car, but it kind of, you know, your car's kind of lame. I have a better car. New opportunities. Like we don't drive anymore. I'm going to show you how to fly. It's changing the whole paradigm is shifting the whole thing. Right. And so when I got into, um, after I learned this, right, was about the same time I was launching click funnels. It was interesting because I was trying to understand how does this work for me? How do I create a new opportunity? Right. And you have to understand a new opportunity is not typically like I'm creating a whole new product. It's the, how you position the product. Does that make sense? And so I started looking at it and, uh, and I realized, okay, if I would have launched click phones, I'd be like, it's kind of like, um, it's kind of like mail chimp only better. It's kind of like infusion soft only it's, it's, it's better. Right. It's got more features. It's faster. It does this. It's kind of like lead pages, but it builds better pages. Like if I were done, that would have been an improvement offer. Right. And so instead I was like, okay, like focusing on channeling my inner Dan Kenny. If I was Dan Kenny, I was, if I was positioning this, how to do it differently. So what we did is we, we created a new opportunity. Okay. At the time, nobody was doing funnels. Right. And yes, our, you know, click phones has a CRM. It has a page builder. It has email marketing, automations. It has affiliate platter. It has all the things, right? It has better versions of all of those. But what we did, we focused on what's the new opportunity and for us, the new opportunity was this thing called, can you guys guess it's called a sales funnel. Right. It's like, like that is the thing we're going to build sales funds. That was the new opportunity that we wanted to introduce into the world. Okay. And so when we came out, it wasn't saying this is a better way to grow a business. It was like, there's, you know, it's not better. This is the new opportunity. Right. It's not a website. It's not this. It's a new opportunity. It's the thing called a funnel. Okay. Another good example, if you look at throughout history, like Steve Jobs, it was the best at doing this. Right. Um, if you look at like when he came out with, with the iPod initially, he wasn't saying, Hey, I have a better way. Like right now you get, you can get 50 songs on, you know, a typical CD has 10 songs. He wasn't saying there's, you know, now we've created something. You can get 50 songs on a CD. He was like, no, no, no, it's like CDs are dead instead. And he pulls out his pocket. Boom. The iPod. Right. Uh, a dozen years later, he comes out, not just a better phone or different phone. He comes out like, like everyone else doing phone calls. We have boom and iPhone. It was a new opportunity, right? A new category was created. And by doing that, that opens up the whole world to you. Right. When you become a category of one. And so when you create a new opportunity, that's how you grow. That new opportunity will outconvert any improvement offer all day long. And so most people struggle because they, they put themselves in a category with a whole bunch of other people and you see it all day long. Like mine's better. Mine's faster. As opposed to saying, well, it's a new opportunity I can create that's different. Like that's the key to being successful. And so that's the real, like of all the things I learned from Dan Kennedy inside this opportunity concepts course, this was the most powerful thing I learned because it gave me a way to position my offer that was, that was completely different. All right. And I want to show you guys one little hack that I learned just recently that you ever studied with me or read my book.com secrets. I talk about this concept called a value ladder, right? Where you come, you, your business comes in, you take somebody through this process, right? We're on the left hand side is your price. And over here is your value, right? And so as the price goes up, it increases in value. So what I teach people is like, for example, if you're launching a new business, right, this is the thing you want to sell at the end of the day, right? The most expensive thing. This is the way this is going to be the most expensive provides the most value to somebody. That's the dream thing you want to sell to somebody, right? The problem is like, if I walked up to you on the street and like, hey, my name is Russell Brunson. I know it look like I'm 11 years old, but I want to build you a sales funnel. And if you give me a million dollars and 20% of the cells, that funnel, I'll build you an entire funnel. If I told most people that they'd be like, you're crazy. You look like you're 12. There's no way I'm going to give you a million dollars to build a funnel, right? Cause I haven't provided value to people at that point. So what we do is says at the bottom of the value ladder, we create something that gives them some value, right? They go through this process. What happens to naturally want to send up to the next level to get more. And if they get value at this level of the value ladder, they're naturally going to want to send up and get more. Okay. So eventually this seems like a really good opportunity for them. Right? Same thing is true in, in dating and relationships. I met my wife the very first day. If I would have walked to my wife like, Hey, you're gorgeous. We should get married and have a bunch of kids. She would have freaked out, right? So instead of I do, I come down the bottom of the value ladder, we go on a date. We have a good time. If she likes me and we, she gets value on the first date and my ask her for second date, she's like, yeah, I'd love to do that. Right? They're going to second date. And then we're then, you know, it keeps progressing till eventually when I'm like, Hey, do I get married? She's like, of course I do. You've provided so much value at every step in the relationship that it makes a lot of sense. Right? So that's what the value ladder is. Now here's the nuance I want to share with you guys. It's super powerful. The best thing to sell on the front of your value ladder, 100% of the time is the new opportunity. Right? So somebody comes in and so for me, it could be, maybe it's click funnels. Maybe it's one of my books that teaches new opportunity, whatever it is. Right? But I'm selling the new opportunity on the first tier. That's the best way to get somebody into your world. Right? Then as you send somebody up, typically what happens is they, like for me, someone comes in the world, they read Dock on Secrets or they get click funnels. Right? They got the new opportunity to building a funnel. Now the next phase is then I invite them to join my coaching programs. And what's happening in my coaching programs, by the way, by coaching programs, that's what I'm doing. I am helping them to make their funnels better. So I do do improvement offers, but I do it higher up in the value ladder. Okay. Now check this out. The next year in the value ladder, somebody comes to me and they got a funnel. It's working, but they want me to make it better. You want me to improve upon it. Then they can hire me for one on one coaching where at this level, then I offer repair. Okay. So it's kind of interesting if you look at like how the value ladder works, right? The best selling offers of all time on the front end are new opportunities. We lead, we lead our business with new opportunities. That's where all my ads go to some type of new opportunity. After they become a customer. Right? Then I've weeded out all the people. Now I'm going to help them improve it. The thing that they bought with me, they've been moving proven offers in the back end, if I want to work with you, one on one, that's where repair comes. So it's kind of fascinating way to look at just different ways to weave these offers into your actual business model. Okay. So that's what the opportunity concept course was all about. And what's exciting for us is that recently we just republished this entire course as a multimedia book called selling opportunity that literally went through and took all these videos from the original course, all the books. And it's all in one spot where you can read the book, you can scan a QR code in the video Dan actually teaches things, all pops out. Cause right now you cannot buy this course anywhere on the internet. In fact, I literally bought it on eBay because I couldn't find my copy of it. And it's the only one that was out there. So the only other way to get this and really go deep with Dan Kennedy is if you go to sellingopportunity.com and actually get a copy of this book. We'll put a link down in the description down below, but it's kind of fun because they took something old and we've made it new so everybody can understand how to create a new opportunity inside of their specific businesses. And yes, even though I spent multiple millions of dollars to buy Dan Kennedy's business to get this copy of the course, I had to rebuy it on eBay. I bought it. It came with like three other courses. It cost me like $3,500 to get that. So I'd say when I was sitting there, I probably spent $2,000 to rebuy a course that I already own the rights to because I didn't have the physical copy to show you guys here today. So that is the opportunity concepts course. This is the new version, which is even better here inside the selling opportunity multimedia book. Now, obviously you guys should all go and buy the book, but if you just want my notes, if you'll get the highlights or the best things from this course, again, in the description down below, click on the link. It'll take you to page where we will send you a copy of the notes from the opportunity concepts slash selling opportunity book. That way you can get the highlights. So you can start creating new opportunities inside of your business and be able to change lives to the customers you've been called to serve. Thanks so much for watching. If you enjoyed this video, we'll see you guys on the next one.
