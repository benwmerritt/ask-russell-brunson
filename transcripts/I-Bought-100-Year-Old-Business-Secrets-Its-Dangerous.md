This is a picture of Martin Farmer Burns. What Farmer Burns would do is he would do what we call today a dramatic demonstration to sell his products and services. He was selling wrestling courses, right? He was like, I need to get my message out there. How do I tell more people about what I'm doing? And so what he would do is he would go to the county fairs. He would go all across the country. His neck was so strong that he would get on a hangman's news. They put the noose around his thing and then they would pull the trapdoor. He would fall the six foot drop, which would normally break person's neck and kill them. And then he would sit there and he would whistle the song Yankee Doodle Dandy while everyone around him was taking pictures, clapping and cheering. And then afterwards he would sell access to his wrestling course. Today, I've got the coolest thing to share with you guys because this is a wrestling story, but also marketing story. And it's about one of my heroes, a guy named Farmer Burns. I'm going to show you some of the stories and some of the cool things about it because there's so many cool marketing principles. But also he was selling a mail order wrestling course in 1940. And not only that, he was doing it with space ads that were in magazines. He was doing it through direct mail and sales letters. And over the years, I've collected almost everything that shows how he was actually growing his business. And there's so many powerful principles you can use and apply inside your business to be more successful. This picture right here, the picture of Farmer Burns actually wrestling. I paid $274.45 for this original picture, which is a really cool one. This is another picture and I'll tell you a story. I don't remember how much I spent for this. I couldn't find the listing. I bought this probably 10 years ago. This is a picture of Martin Farmer Burns. He has a hangman noose around his neck. And this is where I want to start this story. What Farmer Burns would do is he would do what we call today a dramatic demonstration to sell his products and services. He was selling wrestling courses, right? He was like, I need to get my message out there. How do I tell more people about what I'm doing? And so what he would do is he would go to the county fairs. He would go from county to county all across the country. His neck was so strong that he would get on a hangman's noose. They put the noose around his thing and then they would pull the trap door. He would fall the six foot drop, which would normally break person's neck and kill them. And then he would sit there and he would whistle the song Yankee Doodle Dandy while everyone around him was taking pictures, clapping and cheering. And then afterwards he would sell access to his wrestling course. The first principle for you guys to learn from Farmer Burns is if you want to promote your products, your services, it's not just putting ads out there. It's creating and doing dramatic demonstrations to get attention, get people talking. Because people would talk about this thing when he would come into a city. People knew that Farmer Burns was coming and they all wanted to come and watch him do the famous hangman drop. And then they'd come in there and watch it astounded it was possible and they would go buy his wrestling course. Even they didn't want to be wrestlers because they wanted to learn how to have the neck like Farmer Burns. What he was selling most of the time was his mail order wrestling course. And I will show you this. This is with the actual book course that Matt Fury relaunched as a physical book. And he sold millions of dollars worth in the last 20 years or so since he republished it. But I want to show you guys the sales process behind what he was doing. Because there's so many cool little nuances of what he did and how he did it. So the first one right here, this is the actual ad that he was running in magazines and flyers and things like that. It says, he thought he could throw me, but and then learn wrestling secrets from World, World Champion Farmer Burns and Frank Gotch. Send for your free book. So he started with a free lead magnet, right? They put the advertising out there and send a lead magnet for free book. And so this one took me years to finally be able to be able to find. But this was the actual book that they were selling. It's called physical culture and wrestling. This is what Farmer Burns used to build his entire business. It's a lead magnet just like lead magnets nowadays. When you open it up, you start reading it. It's very cool things talking about wrestling and giving you some information. They run the ad first, people respond to the ad. They send this lead magnet, the end of the lead magnet. Then from there, they would sell the actual course. And so this was a course they would mail every single month. They would get new lessons. They would walk him through how to strengthen their neck, how to lift weights, how to do calisthenics, how to get, become a better wrestler, how to do the core locks and the different moves and things like that. This is another version I got that not in the glass. I'll show you kind of what each of these looks like. Kind of a neat fact. When I built my wrestling room, my house, I wanted to put a lot of just cool like Easter eggs throughout the wrestling room so that was just special and unique. And if you are ever a chance to go there or see any of the videos of it, we have these gladiator walls behind the gladiator walls. I actually took one of my first edition copies of Farmer Burns course and we actually took one and it was kind of painful because like we destroyed it. But we turned it into wallpaper. The lesson they've signed up for, right? This is book number two and then inside there'd be two different lessons. And so literally it's like, here's the different exercises. Here's how to do it. Ahead of the time they were like, people weren't selling home study courses back in the day and he was doing it for wrestling. So this was the actual home study course that people signed up for. They would get mailed out to them every single week. As I started finding ones that actually came in the original packaging, I noticed that sometimes he would send this with one of the mail or courses. But between the different courses coming out, he wasn't just just shipping them out there packaging. He was a great marketer who's always thinking about follow-up. And how do we get people more happy with the product? How to make sure they get results during the off weeks? He send them actual letters. And so these are the equivalent of follow-up emails that we send out to our audience as nowadays. Okay. And they're really cool because each one, you know, it's dear so-and-so. Like what he's doing here is so powerful. It's like Dan Kennedy 101. Dan Kennedy been doing a print newsletter for man for 40 some odd years, right? And when we bought Dan's company from him and I was trying to change the newsletter stuff, he's like, no, you don't understand. It's like the goal of the newsletter is to build relationship with the attractive character. He's like 20% content, 80% is entertainment, building relationship. Like Farmer Burns understood it back then. Like he's not just like, here's five more exercises to do. He's telling a story. Like I was out there. I met the student. Here's what we did. And like and then your surely Farmer Burns signs it and sends it out, right? Okay. So the question now is how can you use this stuff inside of your business, right? Like as you are launching a product or a book or a course or something like how can you implement some of the stuff? So number one, coming back to Farmer Burns doing the hangman drop. My question for you is what is the secret sauce? Like what is the thing that you have that's unique, right? It's demonstratable. You can demonstrate to create some type of dramatic demonstration around it or who do you know that can help with that? Remember when I launched my expert secrets book? I was at a time of my life where I was trying to think about like, hey, how do I get attention? I want people to like I've so I said so much time right if I want everyone in the world to know about it. I want them to buy it. And I remember thinking, okay, what are the different dramatic demonstrations I can do and we did a lot of them. But one that was really fun and really simple is I realized that like me reading my own book isn't that cool. But I was like, what if I worked with the world's fastest reader and have him come to Boise and have him read the entire book? And I luckily I know him. His name is Howard Bergs. I called Howard Bergs up. I'm like, I have a crazy idea. Would you be willing to come out to Boise? I want you to read my book and then I'm going to quiz you on to see if you actually read it and he was like done. We brought him out there. Everything set up in life and then we click live on Facebook live. I was like, everyone I'm here with Howard Bergs. The world's fastest reader. I give Howard my book. I'm like, all right, he never read it yet. I can't read this book and we set a timer. He said, go and we started a clock. He opens the book and if you ever seen Howard read, he reads like this. It's like insane. Like and so we sat there and we timed him. He read my entire book in under five minutes. If I remember, if I remember right, he reads the entire book and afterwards I'm like, okay, Howard, me and everybody you're watching thinks this is fake. You do not actually read the book. So give me the book back. I'm going to ask you some questions. What's the three things you have to have to start a mass movement? He's like, attractive character goes through my thing. I'm like, okay, and he goes through and he knew everything that I said by reading my book in five minutes and what just happened. We got attention and so from that one dramatic demonstration, we sold hundreds and hundreds of copies of the book and then it gets better because after we're done with that, we took that clip and we made an ad with a countdown clock, him reading the book, all the stuff. And then we ran that as an ad which sold thousands of copies of the book over time. So that's just one example of how you can use dramatic demonstrations like farmer burns it to get more message and more people excited about whatever it is you're selling because most people go and they create an ad to put out there to help for the best versus like how do you create something that people will talk about people will debate in the comments like something that's actually exciting and interesting. The sales funnel is the secret that you get attention. The sales funnel is the thing that actually gets you to make money. The entire world is a sales funnel. You guys understand it. This is not something we invented. Look at how the legends back in the day, how they built and grew their companies because all these principles they were using back then. You apply those things today will give you an unfair advantage over all your competitors and every else who are in the markets you're trying to compete in. All right, I got a gift for you guys.
