Best day of the year! Russ is getting interviewed here for the entrepreneur of the year award one of the finalists here so lots going on and it's gonna be kind of a crazy day. Okay, ready? And just keep your eyes on the camera the entire time. Okay, ready? One, two, three, go. Music Our company, we are obsessed with entrepreneurs and so this is a huge honor to be just part of this group. It's so amazing to see all these entrepreneurs and how every single one of the people here are doing their best to try to change their world in their own little way and it's inspiring. This quote I think sums it up the best. It says, Here's the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs and square holes, the ones who see things differently. They're not fond of the rules and they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, you can disagree with them, you can glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things. They push the human race forward and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius because they are the ones who are crazy enough to think they can actually change the world and they are the ones who do. Thank you very much. Guess who just got here? I think he's excited for some fireworks. Are you ready for some fireworks? So there's a reason why the Fourth of July is by far my favorite holiday. I look forward to it all year long and the main reason is something that probably a lot of people don't know about me and my personal life. So I have an older sister, her name is Stacy, and she was born mentally handicapped and she actually passed away when she was 30 years old, she was two years older than me, so when I was 28, just one of the most amazing people on planet Earth. About a year after she passed away, there's a really neat guy that moved into the church that I go to and his name is Jesse Poudrebaugh. I miss you so much. And when I first met Jesse, just instantly fell in love with him, became a best friend and after that became even more like a brother. It's been a lot of time with Jesse, a lot of holidays with Jesse, but by far the best time with Jesse is on the Fourth of July. I would always do, every year, is be by a whole bunch of smoke bombs and we'd blow them up together and it's a ton of fun. Now, as much fun as that is, and my favorite things to teach Jesse about is I always tell him that someday my goal for him is to get to heaven and to marry my sister and then Jesse and I would be real brothers. So it's a lot of fun, love Jesse, love the Fourth of July and I love smoke bombs. Oh, this land we love America. The best day of the year, huh? Okay, they've been trying all night to make the snowman, the bubble soccer snowman. Hey, who wants to build a snowman? Do you want him? Build a snowman. Guess what? Mother Funnel's about to go live. This is it over on the staging server. It's like eight months of funnel building. I know it seems simple as one page, but it's like a billion pages behind this and 90 share funnels for funnels. I'm so proud of it. Tear coming to my eye. Anyway, it's awesome. Alright, here we go. Operation Two Saint. The movie premiere. 7pm. Alright guys, how you feeling? Come down to the end? Down to the wire. The forces of evil were conspiring against us today. Jake, how we doing? It's good. It's pretty good costume. Feels good. Feels good. We're set? We're set. We're ready. Game time. What's a movie premiere with Al Popcorn? We've got Operation Underground Railroad. Alright, so it's a little early. We've got about a half hour before we kick things off here. We've got people already coming in. This room will get pretty crowded here. Thank you, Melanie. Hey everybody, welcome to the office. Glad to have you guys all here. We got a lot of our team here, so our friends and family members and everything. So we appreciate all you guys coming out. I am Super Side Force Knight. It's really a special night and glad to be able to share with all of you guys. Some of you guys heard about a year ago we got contacted and were asked if we would help to help Operation Underground Railroad to help save more children. I didn't know what that organization was. I had no idea ahead of time. I never dreamed that I would work in Haiti. I didn't know anything really about Haiti until I learned about a little boy who was born in Utah, U.S. citizen, and was kidnapped in Haiti from his church, where his father was the pastor. I read about it in local newspaper. I thought that I could make it into a U.S. case and I couldn't because it wasn't. We had to leave our jobs. I had to leave my job because I just had to do something about it. We went to Haiti to look for his son. Yeah, it's right here. Right here. And we never found him. People weren't talking about human trafficking like they are now. And really it's because of the work and efforts by organizations like Operation Underground Railroad. It's a subject that nobody wants to think about or talk about. It's the worst part of humanity. And yet we've got to do something about it. Every 30 seconds a child is sold. They're sold for sex. They're sold for labor. They're sold for organ harvesting, which is something we're now getting into. There are 6 million children that are forged into one of those three categories right now. And the world doesn't know. Not a lot of people know, but the profile for men who travel abroad to have sex with kids are American citizens. The U.S. creates the demand. The highest producer and consumer of child pornography is right here in the United States. Well, if you lost one of your children to one of these evil people, you'd do anything to get even and get your child back. I had a knock on my door one day. Tim said, listen, I really feel like I could do better leaving the government. I'd find a group of kids in Guatemala or Colombia, and I couldn't do anything about it because it wasn't a U.S. case. It's outside of the jurisdiction, and I understood that. However, that doesn't mean that we couldn't be doing more. Tim Ballard left his law enforcement career everything that he knew, his pension, his security, to start a nonprofit called Operation Underground Railroad. They've done jumps everywhere throughout the world, rescued kids, and then helped them get to a safe place with their aftercare programs. He had a way that we could really make an impact, but they needed a million dollars to start. And I said, I'm in. We had set up this operation that looked like it went flawless. We unfortunately got some very frustrating news. The traffickers were being released and that all the girls were released. They paid money to the right people, to the judges. The job's not quite done, but it's almost done because now we need to go back and we need to re-arrest every single one of these traffickers. It will be a message to Haiti, to America, to the whole world that there are good people everywhere that will stand up for this.
