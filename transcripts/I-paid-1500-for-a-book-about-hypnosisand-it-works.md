If you want to have personal influence on other people, you've got to master on willpower, which means you have to craft your own environment to be successful. I was talking to one of my friends, he's like, I want to lose weight for a long time. It wasn't until I joined a gym, but it had a specific, it was like group classes, we were like, where I was in this environment, I had to show up, and he's like, when I did that, he's like, I lost weight, I got healthy, and everything happened very, very quickly because I crafted the environment. Hey, this is Russell, welcome back to my vault. Today, I've got two treasures. I've only found two copies of this ever. It's called the philosophy of personal influence. Each one of these cost me $1,500. There's only, again, two that I've ever had a chance to find. But I love this because personal influence is such a big concept for any of us, right? Because it's twofold. Number one is like, how do you personally influence yourself? But then number two is, how do you influence other people? Like what's the philosophy of it? The more you understand the philosophy, the more likely you are to have success. The authors of these magazines, there's two of them, one's named E. Virgil Neal and then X. Lamout Sage. So again, two people I've never heard of before, but they started this magazine back in the early 1900s and they were both hypnotists. So using hypnotic techniques for all sorts of stuff, for stage hypnosis, for surgeries, things like that, how do you use these concepts and these principles for personal influence? And so the very first thing that they talk about in these magazines that I thought was really interesting is that the first thing to understand is you have to master willpower for yourself. Like you cannot personally influence and persuade other people if you haven't learned how to personally influence yourself. And this is a fascinating thing. I see a lot of people obviously who come into my world. They see an ad, they see a video and they're like, I wanna start a business online. So they go and they buy expert seekers or one of my books, they read it and then they're here and they're trying to figure out how to persuade other people, how to help them, how to use their expertise. It's interesting because what I see with a lot of these people initially is that they haven't figured out how to master themselves first. And so it's very difficult to go and influence somebody else if you haven't mastered it yourself first because people can see it, they can feel it. Even they don't know what it is, they're like there's some reason why I don't wanna like, I'm on the webinar but I'm not buying that thing or I'm seeing them socially and I'm not connecting, I'm not following. And it's typically because of this because they haven't mastered themselves first. Like that's always the first step in this, right? Again, in the early 1900s, a lot of people focus more on just willpower. If you fast forward to today, there's a lot of really good books about it. One of my favorite is by Dr. Benjamin Hardy called, I think it's called Willpower Doesn't Work. And what he talks about is how hard willpower is. We have this window where we're trying to like, to will ourselves, like I'm gonna eat healthy, I'm gonna exercise, I'm gonna do whatever. And like, we create this willpower but willpower is finite. Like it runs out of energy over time, right? So like, that's why so many people are like, I'm gonna use my willpower, I'm gonna set my new year's resolutions, we're gonna change the world. And you try for a little bit, then what happens? You start pushing for a little bit and then it all crumbles and it falls apart because your willpower runs out of energy and excitement and those things and they kind of crush, right? And so his premise in the book is that willpower is fleeting but the only thing that actually causes lasting change is by changing your environment. Knowing that you have to have the willpower, it's like, how do you structure your environment when willpower is no longer necessary? I was talking to one of my friends, he's like, I wanna lose weight for a long time. He's like, it wasn't until I joined a gym but it had a specific, it was like group classes. We was like, where I was in this environment, I had to show up, everyone was there. You know, we were all sitting there together. There's a concept in ADHD called body doubling where it's like, when you're with other people, it doubles your productivity to say, I'm body doubling with other people. I got this environment, because I'm in the environment, if I'm working out by myself, I'm gonna be lazy. I'm gonna like, some days I might be motivated, other days I'm not, but when I'm in an environment with other people, he's like, that environment creates the atmosphere I need to be successful. He's like, when I did that, he's like, I lost weight, I got healthy and everything happened very, very quickly because I crafted the environment. The next phase then is understanding, for you to be able to have personal influence on other people, right? It's not just a fleeting like, oh, they got my email, they liked it. Oh, they saw this video, they saw me on TikTok. Like those things are like a flash in the pan. Like they dissipate, they disappear, right? For you to be able to actually have personal influence on somebody, it's also about creating environments. If I look at our business, right? Like when we launched ClickFunnels initially, people were signing up, it was kind of this segment of thing, it's like we needed to gather people together and create an environment. And so we created the very first Funnel Hacking Live event, right? We created this environment, we brought people into that environment and it gave us the chance to have influence on people. Like while we were there, the very first Funnel Hacking Live ever, those who were there 10 years ago, they had 11 years ago now, crazy. It was in Las Vegas, people were coming in and like, we need to like infuse our person, like what we do into this. And so to build ClickFunnels, we do these things called hackathons where we'd all get together, we jam in a room and we sit around at computers and we would just work. And so the first few Funnel Hacking Lives, like we weave that into the events, people would come and say, hey guys, we're doing hackathons in the next three hours, get your laptops out and go find some of the hallways and like find a couple people and like actually build Funnels, like create something amazing. And so like we forced people to do these hackathons and it started this thing where it started sticking where people like, when people left from Funnel Hacking Live, they would get to people locally and they'd get together in their own little environments to model and match what we'd created with them, right? Like they came to your environment where they learned the model and then we were able to influence them inside that. And then from there, they went home and be able to go and create their own versions of that, right? In my inner circle, right? Literally if you go to innercircle4life.com, that is the signup page for people who joined my inner circle program. And the headline is all about the room where it happens. In fact, you watch the video, we literally ripped the audio from Hamilton where he's singing the room where it happens and it shows clips and videos of these rooms that we curate and we create where things are happening. Okay, why am I doing that? I've got your attention for 10 minutes maybe, right? And then you're off to the next thing, you're swiping, you're moving. I have to pull you from situations like this, create environments, bring you there. And this is how I can actually have influence on you, okay? It does not happen in a short term hit like this. It happens in environments. And so for inner circle, I create environments for, there's events, there's different type events, there's things we do with events, there's things we experience with these events. We're taking people to Mexico, we're going on cruises, we're taking them to Baltimore, which was actually insanely cool because that environment was different, right? My Atlas group, the group pays me $150,000 a year. I was saying to you, I'm like, what's the environment I need to create to give these guys the breakthrough? And when I told them all, we're going to Baltimore, they're like, wait, last year we went to Arizona, we were hot tubbing and swimming and goofing off and stuff. And I'm like, yeah, we're going to Baltimore. And I'm like, why Baltimore? And the reason I took to Baltimore is because Baltimore happens to be the largest company in the world who does direct response marketing in our space. It's a company called the Gore Publishing. They do like a billion and a half dollars a year, selling a $49 financial newsletter. We get in the scene and the environment was unique. It was interesting, right? Then everyone got in there. First off, everyone gets like, this feels different. I'm not sure what to expect. And I was like, you guys were here today because we're going to change how you view business forever. Like you've been all in the Russell Brunson world, we all view business this way, which is great. We've all had success. But Russell's not doing a billion and a half dollars a year. These guys are. What do they know that we don't know? And I was like, I needed to bring you to this environment, this situation, because it's going to impact you differently. I can influence you differently here than I can in my office in Boise, Idaho, right? So we bring in the Baltimore, bringing this crazy place. And then we had people from their team come and actually share and like share their ideas. And because of the environment, everything else shifted because of it. We were able to influence people in a much deeper level. And when everyone was flying home from the event in our, the group chat we have, everyone's like, I'm not going to lie, I'd not want to go to Baltimore, Maryland, like it made no sense why we went here. I didn't know who Gora was, but like because of that environment you created, like I had the a-ha's, the breakthrough, the shifts I actually needed, right? So the environment is how you actually have the influence on people you want to have. This is the message and the lesson I want you to really get from mastering yourself first. And then number two is then that way you can master other people and realizing, and again, this wasn't talked about in these magazines, but, but you know, fast forwarding a hundred years through history and research and stuff we know, the way to master your willpower is through the crafting and creating of environments. I need you guys who would like be interested in like some of the core philosophies, because again, there's a lot of hypnotism we've did to here. There's a lot of other cool principles that they talked about that I thought were fascinating and fun, maybe not, you know, all the guys would geek out on it, but some of you guys would be like, let me, like give me everything. So we'll have my notes down below from both these magazines. If you click down below, get notes for free that way you can have a chance to glimpse inside of these rare artifacts that have literally been lost to time where you can learn more about how to have more personal influence on yourself, but then also on the people that you have been called to serve. So I hope you enjoy this. Thank you so much. I'll see you guys on the next video.
