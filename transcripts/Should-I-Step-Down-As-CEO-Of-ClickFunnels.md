Alright, so the mastermind, I didn't really know what to expect. I asked Dean and Dean was like, oh, well, we can talk about business, but we always talk about business. Like, let's leverage Tony while we got him for a couple hours. Okay. Russell, you want to join us too? Yeah. Okay, cool. I think it would be worth taking a few moments, a minute or two with each, and have you tell us where are you right now in your life? Where are you? What's great? What's missing? What needs to change? And let's see if we can't go a little deep so it's not a surface thing here. We're happy to answer marketing and sales and business questions, of course, but my hope for you is that we go a little deeper because how many of you are between 35 and 45? Virtually all of you. If you're in that range close to it, every stage of life has different opportunities and different challenges, and I'm lucky enough to live almost 60 years now, and I can look back on those years and see each decade, and everyone's different. Nothing's universal, but there's certain things that at stage of life show up for people pretty predictably. And if we look at some of those things, we might be able to give you even more help than just your business, which will help your business as well. So if you're open to it, we'll go there. I'd suggest going deeper than you even thought you were going to be. I also want to give it up for Russell, our other partner and friend, and help make this. What a great friend, and it's been amazing for us to get to know you more and collab. It's been so awesome. You guys are family now. So without any further ado, let's do this. And the way we basically did it was there's 10 of us that were kind of in this little small group, and Dean and Tony are in front, and everyone had a chance to kind of do some sales, talk about what they were doing, having success, so everyone could celebrate together, and then talk about what in your business or your life you were, you know, you had questions about, or you were to crossroads and didn't know what to do, or just kind of, you know, be vulnerable and share that a little bit. And I was in the second row, so I had a little while to kind of sit back and just relax and a couple hours to watch him go deep on everybody else. But what's amazing about Tony, when you watch him do what he does, he has context of who's in the room, so when he does like he'll go deep on someone, does the intervention, as he's doing it, he's saying things specifically that he knows that like Russell needs to hear or Jenna needs to hear, whatever. And he'll say something, and he'll mention it, and he'll look at me like direct eye contact, like that was for you Russell, I'm like, got you, like okay, I'm picking up what you're laying down. So I had a chance to see him do a bunch of interventions like Lewis Howes and Josh Spizzoni and Billy Jean, and just all the people leading up to me, you know, and from everyone's presentation I got different pieces about like how to structure your life, how to do your morning routines, all these cool things made me start thinking in my head about click funnels in the future and what do I want to actually do? Has this been, we've worked with individuals, but how many gotten something for yourself at each one so far, just want to make sure? Okay, good, just want to make sure. In fact, by the time he got to me I was just like, I'm kind of good, like I know most of the answers I'm looking for. Hey, you should be up here talking, what are you doing sitting there? No, I want to be back here. But there's one question that I've always wanted to ask Tony, but I've been really nervous about it. And it's kind of a question that like, I don't think anyone else would ever dare to ask him or even bring it up, but Russell at lunch today, so what I really want to ask Tony is, how's his breath always so amazing? How's your breath always so amazing? Your breath is insanely good all the time. That's what he said. That's my real question. It's actually a real question, but you can text me the answers that one sometime. All right, so what's that? Alkalinity. I literally said last night. When your breath's bad, you're very acidic. Huh? That's all I got? It's hard to put it as an actual question, so I'm not really sure exactly. It has to do with kind of just direction. So, obviously, ClickFunnels turns five years old in two weeks. It's been five years run. That's awesome. Thank you. It's become bigger than we ever, I think, dreamt initially, and it's been a really, really fun ride as we've been growing. We're almost 400 employees now. We passed 95,000 active customers last week. We're shooting 100,000 by the end of this year. So, a lot of fun things. That's what I'm saying. It's not a promotion. It's a business. But also, I remember the very first time we met at UPW like 10 or 11 years ago. Toronto? Toronto, yeah. And you told me, so the reason why you got into this business is because of the art. You were doing your art and then you built a business because you had to do it to be able to support your art. And I've always felt like that's very similar to me. I love the art of what I do. That's what I'm passionate about. That's all about that for me. And as a business has grown, I'm still in the CEO role and I think that's been one of the hard things is that as it's grown, my ability to do the art has shrunk. I have pockets of times I get to do it. Like doing events, I love writing the books. I love doing content. But now I'm a CEO also, which especially at this level, there's all the legal compliance which you take my art and then the lawyers look at it and they try to destroy the art before they send it out, which makes it hard. And then you get just all the government regulations. We process $4 billion so far through ClickFunnels. Now it's just like the bureaucracy. That part of it now is what takes up so much of my time. And my ability to spend time in the art has gotten smaller and smaller. And I think that's kind of then this weird spot right now where it's like we have an opportunity. I think if we wanted to exit, we could exit. But then I have the fear of if I did exit, would I lose my art? Is there a way to exit and keep the art or is it just do I need to shift so I can do my art and not worry about that part of it? And so that's kind of the question coming into it, which a lot of stuff you said to Josh has been, was really good for me as well. Yours is different though because you have really mastered that business at a really amazing level where you could sell it for a billion dollars probably on a gross multiple, as you described, right? So I don't think it's quite the same thing there. But I think the difference is the art matters to you emotionally. That's why I brought it up to you when I was talking up here. It matters to you so much that if you don't have what's next before you sell it, you're making a big mistake. So you've got to decide, I'm going to get, like, maybe I'll get evaluations slightly less, but all my employees will win and all win and I can keep running it and I'll do my art and I'm going to hire someone to be the CEO and I'll be the chairman. That's what I would do. That's what I am in my company. I'm the chairman. I'm no longer the CEO. So you either decide to exit because you don't want those things. In those cases, you know, I'm not the CEO there anyway, someone else is doing it, but for me it was getting in the way of what I wanted to do. And the other is I made myself chairman. I hired CEOs that are really skilled in those areas and then decided what I want to do with those businesses because I want to keep them. So I got enough assets, enough benefit, I don't need to sell them. You have enough assets probably because you live very humbly. This guy's one of those humble people I know. He's like 100 million times better than he ever projects himself to be. He always understates who the f**k he is. He's a total f**king stud and he's incredibly humble, is he not? And it's incredible. And he lives humble life and he's got five beautiful children and he's like, he's just a great human being. You all know that, I think, if you interact with him. So you have all that by the f**king, so to speak, by the tail. So to me it'd be like, okay, I can exist, but if I'm going to do it, what I'm going to use that for that's going to be even more fulfilling. Otherwise, I should keep this and get someone else to f**k who I don't want to do, who's even better than me. Get back into my art, but my, as your friend, you love what you do. You light up when you know, I love being around you. You all get mental, quick fun, and I was like, wow. It's like, it's like Jesus has come to earth and he's coming through his body. You know, it's a beautiful thing, you know? So for you to sell that is really exciting right now. I don't know if it'll be exciting five years from now. And last, you found the next most exciting thing that you're going to go build and make happen and go do. Because the money's not going to change your life, brother. It'll change your life for the moment. It'll provide some comforts or some securities, maybe more than you have, but honestly, the lifestyle you have, you've got plenty. I would not let the momentum of the business determine where my life is going to go. I decide where my life's going to go and decide where the business needs to go based on that. Because otherwise, everybody around you is going to push you towards it, because a billion dollars, like that's the big number everybody wants to hit. Not everybody, most people don't hit a million dollars, but a billion dollars. Oh my God, you know, a billion dollars is unbelievable, but most of your life probably won't change very much. So maybe decide how you're going to get the assets you want for yourself and your family, but where you could do the art still and keep growing it just for your own fulfillment. And because you have so much to give and you're like, hold on to you now. 39. You're not even 40, you're not even going to be a god in your journey. That's beautiful what you've accomplished. No, I mean, that's not a derogatory, it just means, well, you're 60. You think about the next 20 years what you can do from where you are now. The thing to me, where I was at 39 was like, most people are like, oh, it's unbelievable. It was like nothing compared to what I'm doing now. So I wouldn't sell myself short for the money. I could still get the money. You should be smart. You should take it off the table. You built something. You should do it. You should help your people do it. Figure out what your plan is that's going to be more fulfilling. That's the most important thing. The thing is in the end, it's the fulfillment is going to make the quality of your life happen. It's not going to be the dollars. And you love what you do, brother. And you're getting pulled away from some of it, as you said, more and more. So all the more reasons to sell the business, but that's not really the reason. That just means you shouldn't be doing that role. Find somebody who's so good at the role that loves that. That's what you put in there, that they thrive on that. It's like knowing what your greatest gifts are and staying with those even more. The business wouldn't be here because of your CEO role. The business is here because of your vision and your influence and your passion and your creativity and your intelligence and your caring and your ability to teach and your humility. That makes everybody go, man, he really seems like an easy guy. If he can do it, I can do it too. You don't seem like super human and you are. But you don't seem like it, which is what makes more people be able to succeed. I'm six seven, so sometimes I think I'm super human. I'm not super human, right? But they think I am. So then sometimes I was like, Tony can do that. What about me? They don't have to do what I do. They can do what they do even better, you know? Make sense? I think for sure, obviously you're on track to do great things. But I think if you got the right CEO in place who loved being a CEO as much as you love marketing, there's another level of exponential growth because I know you. You and I market. We think a lot alike. We have great conversations. You're just getting pulled away from that genius of yours. Your biggest growth could be just what Tony's talking about is a CEO that loved running the day to day as much as you love marketing and you got back into your craft. I think there's a, I think there's another exponential growth waiting with that decision. But also, it's also timing. You should probably take something off the table, right? But still keep your vehicle unless you found a better one. You get out of what you don't enjoy because when you do what you enjoy, you crush it, right? And you feel alive. She knows better than anybody, right? There's two types of marketing that are going sucking your energy. External or internal marketing. External marketing is the time you're spending serving the customer and the client or maybe your internal clients. Internal marketing is dealing with all the sh** that frustrates you and pisses you off. And if you're spending so much time on internal marketing, you have less for external marketing, the business will not have the same value. Or more importantly, even the business keeps going, you aren't feeling the same value. So there's only so much E. I got a lot of it. You guys do too. E meaning pure energy. But there is a limit no matter who we are, no matter how strong you are. So you got to say, where is that energy going to go? And if there's any mistake I used to make, by the way, it's stayed with people way too long because I'm a very loyal person. But what I've learned is if I'm not loyal to the mission, if I'm not loyal to the best players by trying to stay with somebody, and if you're going to play with Michael Jordan, you better be ready to play. Otherwise, go play somewhere else. Nothing wrong with you not wanting to give the same amount as I do, but you shouldn't be on this team. Find somebody that loves to deliver as much as you do on the marketing or Dean said, it'll be a different game for you. As a consumer of your content, I listen to every podcast that you release and I can hear you just trying your best to squeeze in that time, like on your drives to work or wherever it can be. And it's always goals. And I always do kind of leave those episodes thinking like, what if Russell just had more time to create, to write, to do what frankly you do best. And so I think that chairman is a really interesting role for somebody like you. That was cool. Good man. James. Well, thank you both so much. I feel like I've already gotten so much. My name is James Malthough and I... Yeah, I think a lot of entrepreneurs, they start their businesses because they're passionate about a thing, right? Like, I'm a great photographer, I'm great designer, I'm great, whatever, they get into it because of the passion for the thing. And then you have to learn all these businesses to be able to support the art. And I think it's interesting how we all eventually have to become the CEO of our business because we're the ones who are the most passionate. We get stuck in the CEO role because that's where you need to be to drive the ship. But a lot of times that's what then makes it so you don't have to spend time with the art. And then you start, in some cases, resenting it. It shifts really quickly from being an entrepreneur to back to being a job. It's kind of the opposite of the reason why most of us got into this business. I'm not exactly positive what I'm going to do. For sure what I'm going to do is I'm going to try to have an inventory of myself to really sit down and say, okay, what are the things that I love? If I was to design my perfect week, what would that look like? If I was to design my perfect month and perfect year, I think a lot of times we don't focus on architecting that and designing it. So instead, come to the office every day and it's like, ah, there's a whole bunch of fires. Like, what fired up? I put out first, second, and third. Instead, it's coming back to, okay, who's the person that can be in charge of the fires? I was to build this from a ground up right now and only put myself in the spots that give me the most passion and fire and excitement. Like, what would those be? Almost like writing your own job description for your own job. Like, this is my job description. I do this, I do this, I do this, I do this, I do this. And then making a job description of stuff you don't like as much. And take that job description, like, who's the person that wants this job? Because there are people who love it. Like, I still, I go out to my funnel building team and I'm like, you guys are so lucky. Like, I have to have a meeting with so and so. And you're going to build funnels. Like, I love it. I love sitting down on the whiteboard and architecting it. And figure out the designs, the branding, the logos, the hook, the offer, the copy. Like, oh, like being in the middle of that. And when it's done, you see the end funnel, like, how beautiful is like, oh, like, I love that part of it. And the second part I love is like, getting that aha moment for other people. Like, when they're like, I don't know how this, how would a funnel work for me? And you explain to an awesome day, like, they get it. Like, there's something about that. That's the other part. So, I think it's, it's understanding that like, who are the people that are obsessed with and love the things that I don't. And let's, let's give those things to them and let me just do what I love. I don't know, I don't know, if without your love, won't be the right. I think I have survived, but I don't know, if without your love. Thank you.
