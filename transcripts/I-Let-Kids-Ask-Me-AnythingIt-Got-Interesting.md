How much money you make an hour? I'd say Probably Hey, just so your product Love this guy. I honestly believe the entrepreneurs are the only people that can actually change this planet And The clock is ticking Literally the clock is ticking. I'm gonna hurry here. All right. Welcome you guys come on in grab a seat We've got some really fun. We want to do you guys We want to invite we've had some kids to miss some questions There they come come on If you could go back in time and talk to your 10 year old self what would be the best advice? I like to read not as a kid, but I always read just weird things that did me a thing I think I would do similar what Caleb's dad did him and like find some books that would have helped me with my Myself and start reading some of those like personal development books and things like that because the hardest part about Changing and having success isn't like the tactic usually it's like the stuff between our ears like our brains Like how do we actually do things? So if I would start a younger reading personal development books and how to have confidence and belief I've done that when I was 10 years old because I was nervous and shine awkward to my early 20s Still I'm kind of awkward and shy, but I would have started that way earlier Is this on oh, yeah, it's on this is a very random question people need to know What is your mom's name my mom's name yes very good question My mom's name is Marty and the reason why is her mom's name was Mary and her dad's name was D Lamar and so they took M.A.R. From Mary and D E from D Lamar they put them together and says Marty that's creative Yeah, that's my mom's name Follow up. Okay. What's the follow up? Oh, she doesn't follow up What was one lesson your mom taught you biggest lessons I learned from my mom was how to work hard a lot of people think I learned how to work hard for my dad because he got me wrestling all the time But my mom was the one who made sure I got all my schoolwork done choose what I always wanted to impress I remember when I got done wrestling in college I wanted to kind of just drop out of school cuz I only had two months left But I knew that my mom would only be proud of me if I got my college degree So finished school out make my mom proud. So that's what I learned from my mom My name is Rosslyn and I'm 11 my question was how did you get people to find your podcast? So at first they didn't the first few episodes nobody listened to me I had this this idea is like hey I know that people that listen to podcast like to listen to podcasts because I tried to tell people from email list I tried different ways was hard to get people listened I was like if people like podcasts they'll probably want to listen to my podcast So I found a whole bunch of people in my dream 100 grad podcast now We go on their podcast and I would get interviewed and I would say if you like what you learned I have a podcast over here you should go subscribe to it And so I got their podcast listeners to come listen to my podcast And that's how I started growing it initially my advice for you is I would go and especially for all the kids that are starting Podcasts become friends and interview each other because that way you can start sharing each other's audiences You don't start to get to know each other that way. Thank you. Thank you I'm Tony I'm from Arizona My question is if you could go back into the past and change anything would you I think by the time it's really hard that that like we're painful that I hated but all of them are essential for us to get to Here so I don't think I would without the downs the ups never could happen. So no, I don't think I would change anything Thank you. Yep. My name is Danny and I'm from a Arizona When did he start writing your traffic secrets? Oh, that's a good question So I started writing my traffic secrets book over a year ago Dana Derek said an event called his dream dream 100 con and on the flight out there I started creating all the outlines and the doodles and everything and then I gave my presentation there and then I came home I started writing the books. That was a year a little over a year ago. It's a little bit over a year ago It takes a long time ready book for me. I'm slow Thank you very much. Thanks, Danny. Here you go Hi Russell, how's it going? My name is Aubrey my question for you is it's not entrepreneur related. What is it like taking pictures with people? You don't know That is a great question I'm not gonna lie. It's a little awkward for me because I don't understand it really but But the same time it's super flattering You know, it's funny because I spent so long for a decade talking about stuff I try to get people to care and nobody really cared for a long time now that they do it such a huge honor to me And so it always makes me nervous. It always is kind of awkward for me, but it means the world to me as well at the same time Awesome, thanks so much Here you go Hi I'm Catherine and I'm from Nashville and I just wanted to know do you think that there's one element you can put in a funnel that'll help it grow? Like exponentially and stuff There's a lot I would say probably the most powerful because I have some friends who I did a podcast on urgency and scarcity And none of their funnels work So all they did is it went back and they added urgency and scarcity to their funnels and now they have a multi Million-dollar year business because nobody would buy their stuff and it's like always there So they always just take it away and that's what got them to all their cells I think if there's one thing that's like amplify a funnel is adding urgency and scarcity to it If you can go in the past and you made miss when you made a mistake, what would you fix? Let's see if I fix a mistake. I think I would have proposed my wife faster I say that because of all the decisions of my life That was the one that had the biggest most powerful most lasting impact and I would have made it wait earlier if I could have My name is Megan and I'm from Florida and my question was When you make a funnel what makes you proud of it and makes you feel like you're ready to release it to the world Ooh, what makes me proud of it? That's such a good question for me every funnels like art like I see it done It's just like I'm so proud of how it looks like but then the second side is like every funnel We create tied to a result like I know that when someone goes to his funnel This is the result we're promising what they're gonna get the excitement of like what's good people are gonna experience They go through it. That's what gets me like so fired up just knowing. Okay. This is Like when this goes live literally when people start going through it's gonna It's gonna grab them and change their life and just like between the art and knowing what it's gonna change Those are two things that just get me this is why I keep building funnels at this point in my life I could stop but it's just so much fun I'm Chen Luka from Las Vegas, Nevada and Question I have is what is the best way you would say is to build a course? The first best thing to do is to take a take somebody or people through a process to prove that you can get results with it Like before I launched my inner circle program I thought I knew what I was gonna do But I was like I need to test this out So first thing is I found somebody that was like my dream customer and for me was this guy named Drew Canole And I called drew up and I was like I want to work for you for free He's like why am I I have this system this process? I know it's gonna work I just want to do it just to prove that it's actually gonna work and he didn't believe me thought I was lying I was like my problems I'll pay my own way and everything so I flew out there and then I took him and his team through the process of what I Wanted to coach people on a couple of things worked really really good and some things like didn't work perfectly I had to go back and fix them and tweak them and change things until we figured it out And I took their whole team through this process And then we helped them launch their the organified funnel that blew up And I was like he now I have results and then I came back and I was able to build the course and the coaching and everything Around a process that was proving to work So the first thing I always tell people is like go find somebody that you'd want to work with and work for free and do the Whole thing and that'll help you prove the process and you feel more confident when you're teaching it when you're doing it and just Feeling comfortable from there. Thank you. Yep. No worries. Thanks, man So my name is Nicole. I'm from Toronto, Canada I wanted to ask you said you're introverted. What made you be able to talk to so many people and be able to talk? Like this I feel super comfortable even like this interaction with all these guys I can tell nervous I am like I struggled with one-on-one interaction So it's I still have that but I think for me the biggest thing is like I was just I believe so much my message Like I just I had to get out I kept doing it kept saying it kept saying it and I felt I got very comfortable like in this in this type of Platform I feel very comfortable when it gets one-on-one. I still feel more nervous, you know It's just believing enough in something that I kept talking about you talking about like it the way I was talking got more comfortable for me to eventually get to what we really started joining like I love this part now But took a while to get there. That's great questions. Yep. Thanks. Yeah, ask me get really loud signal here How much money you make an hour I'd have to sit down and do the math on that and I don't think you probably believe me Can anyone in my team knows no answer to that how many hours in a year I would say Probably conservative about 10 to 15 thousand dollars an hour Good question. All right, guys, let's give it up for all these great questions. Thank you so much you guys
