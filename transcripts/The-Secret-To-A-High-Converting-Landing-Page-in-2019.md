Those who are just tuning in, my name's Russell Brunson. Right now we're answering a whole bunch of amazing questions about how to grow your companies, internet marketing, personal development, all sorts of stuff. And right now, the question for today is landing page secrets. I'm not getting any leads. What's the secret to high converting landing pages? So I'm gonna tell you guys a story. I learned this from Dagan Smith, and it's brilliant. So Dagan was telling me this story. I'm not the best doodle-erb. I'm gonna do my best, okay? All right, in fact, if you've read either my books, .com, Secrets Book, or Expert Secrets Book, I doodle everything. I'm a doodle-erb. I visually see things, but I'm not the best drawer. So here we go. So for this doodle, I need a tree. So here's my blue tree. So there's the blue tree. And in front of the tree, there's this lake, which is also blue. There's some fish in the lake. And over in the bushes, there is this deer that's coming. This is a deer. And the deer is like, I need a drink of water. Now, the deer represents your customer. Okay, and the lake represents your landing page. Okay, now I've seen a bunch of landing pages. I've seen most of them, okay? Now as the owner of ClickFunnels, I don't know, we have over 65,000 members who are in there using our software every single day. And so I see most of your landing pages, okay? And this is the mistake you're making. I got a green marker now. Thank you, everybody. Now we got a green tree, which makes it a lot better. So this is the problem. You guys are creating this landing page. You're like, oh my gosh, we need to attract all these customers. So because of that, we're gonna do some crazy things. You're sitting out here and like, you're dancing and you're juggling and then you've got, I do it over here, shooting off fireworks. It's all exciting. You're like, oh, I'll come over here to our lake. Now what does that deer do to your customer, this deer over here, who's first, like meeting you and your brand for the very first time ever? Okay, they see that and they're like, oh my gosh. And it's like a twig snapping and this deer runs away and is gone forever. Okay, but that's what we all do because we're so excited about our new customers coming in. Okay, now if you want to make a landing page work, we have to understand is that anything you do that's out of the ordinary, that's crazy, is gonna pull people away. Okay, there's two things on a landing page that are essential to it being successful. All right, number one is it's gotta be simple. If you look at any of my landing pages, they are simple. There's not a lot happening. It's just very much like, okay, this is what you want. You want this free book, you want this free video. Here's the headline about what it's about. It's just very simple and easy. There's not distracting images and buttons and whole bunch of stuff. It's just very simple and easy. The cleaner, the better. Notice my landing pages. Notice how simple they are. Most of the time when people ask me to do website critiques, they log into their Click Phone account and delete 90% of the stuff on the page. Like, okay, does that feel more simple? Like, it's like my customer can now come to the lake and not get freaked out. And then number two, and this is the key. I want you guys to understand this. Number two is curiosity. Curiosity is the king. Okay, I have some members of my inner circle, Mike and AJ, and they're awesome. They had this webinar. I wish I had the stats in front of me right now, but they had this webinar registration page and it was costing Mike $23, $24 to get somebody to register for the webinar. And I remember looking at the page and the page was simple, so they did that part right, but I looked at the message and the headline explained exactly what was happening in the webinar. It was like, you know, register for a webinar to find out how to do local reviews for a company. And it cost Mike $21, $20 per lead on Facebook, which is insane. Like, way too much. And I was like, what should we do? I thought, I looked at it, I said, I know exactly what the problem is. The problem is there's no curiosity. When I look at that page, I don't know exactly what's happening on the webinar. So because of that, the registration rate is going to be low and the show up rate is going to be even lower because I can kind of guess like, oh, I think he's talking about blah. Okay, if someone looks at your page and they can answer the question in their mind, they're not going to give you their contact information. They're not going to go to the next step. They're not going to show up at your webinar. They're not going to opt in for your free gift or whatever that thing is for you. You have to have curiosity. So for them, all we do is we change it and say, instead of saying, find out how to do local reviews, was find out how to get clients, whatever it said. And by the way, this is not by doing Facebook ads. It's not by doing Google ads. It's not by doing all the things that people might think, but we didn't tell them what it was. And people are like, oh my gosh, what is it? I need to find out. They had so much curiosity. They had to put in the email address. They had to show up. And his registration rate went from like $21, $22 per register down to like $3 or $4 per register. And their show up rate went from like 14, 15% to like 30%. Okay, all by increasing the curiosity. So if you want your landing pages to get better, your higher converting landing pages, make them simple and add tons of curiosity. This deer coming to the water is curious. Like, what's that water look like? What's it gonna taste like? Like, what's the process? Like, what's the experience gonna be? So that's why they're tiptoeing over, just like your customer is. If you make it simple, you get all the flashy stuff around it and then make it as curiosity-based as possible. They're gonna come in and they're gonna take you up on your offer. So that is my, probably my number one landing page secret. I hope that helps you guys when you're creating your landing pages inside of ClickFunnels. Because when you do it the right way, that's how you get tons of leads and how you grow your company really, really fast. Thank you so much for watching.
