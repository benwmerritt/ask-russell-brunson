How many books you have down? Six. Do you remember the names of them all? In order? Totally fulfilled. Be a real estate millionaire. Your town, your profits. Real estate profits from home. Millionaire success habits. Underdog advantage. Yes, I got the last one. Which is your favorite of all your books? It's usually the one I just got done with. But the two hands down, millionaire success habits and underdog advantage. Because it's fun giving people the foundation of stuff. You know this because you do so well in your books. It's like so many times people give the tactics, but if the mindset's not there, it doesn't work. So it's that non-going balance between mindset and tactics. So I love weaving the two together. And they really use just like the platform of here's all the mindset for all the things. So I'll talk about, I know everyone's got a different writing process. And I wish when I first wrote my first book I asked more questions about this. Because I didn't know. And I dove in and it was like, it was so painful to start writing. The most painful experience of my life was writing my first book. Yeah, every time. So I'm curious like, what was your writing process like on the first one? And then how has it changed or evolved? Like how do you write now? So my first one, one thing I remember, this is a true story. When I wrote my first book, you're gonna think I'm lying. I had never read an entire book in my life cover to cover. Never, not one. And you got a right one now? And I had a right one. And I felt like a complete phoning because I just had a message to share. But I wasn't a writer and I had been listening to audios non-stop by then, but never read a book. And it was just such an intimidating process. And I didn't have any structure and I didn't interview anybody. I looked at a couple of books and I remember I laid out the chapters and I'll tell you the difference. I know the first one, I felt like I had to start on page one and write a linear book. And that's what was like, it was so much work because I would keep going back like, no, maybe that shouldn't be first. I didn't think of taking all the pieces of the puzzle and like laying them out and then go, Do the parts. Let me just fill these, write these and then stick them where they belong. So that was painful. And then it was even more painful. I get done and I hire an editor and I get her on the phone and she's so fired up. She's like, Oh my God, I want to work with you. You have more enthusiasm than anybody. And I fly to North Carolina where she lives and I hand her the manuscript and she's like, I can't wait to read this. And like four hours later, she calls me. She goes, Dean, completely different tone of voice. It's like, I'm Dean. I don't know how to put this. It doesn't need an edit. I'm like, I'm not good. She's like, it's not a book. She goes, there's a few rules you can break. There's rules to writing a book and you can break a few. She goes, you broke every one of them. She's like, this is a 290 page conversation. I can't edit this. You need to hire a real writer. And yeah, that was fun. I felt really good about myself. I don't know if you still have those. So I don't know if you have those limiting beliefs inside you still, but I still have that like, you're not smart enough. You're in special ed. You didn't go to college writing books is for smart people. You're kind of dumb. You haven't even read a book yet. Yeah, exactly. I just sat on it for like, I don't remember the month or two. And I almost deleted it. I was almost like, why would I even think that? And then, you know how that goes. There's a certain amount of time you change the story. I'm like, nah, she was wrong. I just want to empower people's lives. I'm not a writer, but I got a good story. So I hired a writer just to clean it up. And that book hit the New York Times bestseller list without a bestseller campaign. And it didn't sell a lot of copies. I'd love to say it sold millions of copies. It did probably, I don't even know what it sold, but it happened to sell a lot in a one week period. And somebody hit somebody like took a picture and said, oh my God, you're a New York Times bestselling author. It's like, that was cool. Do you know what it was at the time when you're just like, that big deal? I kind of, but not really. Yeah. But now I can say, I haven't seen New York Times bestselling author. You ever said, go back to that editor and be like, it's just, you know, Yeah, just so you know. Yeah. So that was, that was the first experience of writing a book. It's crazy. My grandpa is a writer. He, he wrote history books, like the books about Columbus and all these things. And I remember he told me, it's like the book you write and they send the editor, the book you get back is not your same book. He's like, he's talking about emotionally hard. That process was to get it back and be like, like, that's not exactly my words. I've always, first time I sent a book to an editor, I had a similar thing that she edited. The first chapter, it's sent it back. And I was like, this doesn't sound like me. She's like, yeah, but it's grammatically correct. And I'm like, I'd rather sound like me than be grammatically correct. So I went back and I'm delete a lot of her stuff. And luckily I didn't get in advance for my book. I didn't have someone saying, well, we paid you for this. It was more like, all right, you're going to fail. But I just like, I want it to sound like me. And, and I've tried to maintain that voice or all the books that the editors know, like, it doesn't have to be perfect as long as you don't ruin parts of it. That I think are essential to the book. Yeah. And the best example, fast forward a little bit, millionaire success habits. That one was completely my voice from start to finish. Like, and I'll tell that process on how I get my voice even more so. And I look back and it was even more just a conversation than any book. And it's my best selling book to date. Right. It's almost a million copies. I've never had more reviews, never had more feedback. So screw all those rules. Yeah. So what was your process being your old that one then? In fact, I'm going to go back to the first one first. So the first one, did you like Microsoft Word or was it? Yeah. Or was it? Microsoft Word. Microsoft Word. Yeah, literally typing and like, and I'm a two finger type. And, and so, and I have to look. So every time I write a book, I'm an agony like my neck because it's like, I'm like looking down, typing. You're still, are you still? I still do. Really? Yeah. You think I would learn by now. I did. Make that a big deal. Like in your ads, like I type this with two fingers. That's how important this message is. Yeah. Still type with two fingers. I'm fast now, but still two fingers. That's amazing. So, so now that you wrote that one there and then obviously evolved each time, but when millionaire success happens, like where's the evolution? Like what if that. So I think this is the most important thing. I still don't love writing books. It's painstaking because you know, like you're putting your life on paper. And every time I, I don't know about you, but when I'm done and it goes to the editor and it comes back and I read it, I'm like, I can make that paragraph better. And then if I fix that, I'm like, oh, it changes the context of the next page. Great. And then, oh, so, um, I'll tell you what I did. Millionaire success habits. Um, I hired a writer to work with me and I gave him a lot of my content. Like if I did an hour presentation on stage about how selling is an evil and that when you love what you do so much and you feel like you're doing a disservice to the world, um, it's a great foundation to turn you into someone who loves sales. And let me tell you the process. And I start up high and then go all the way down to the strategy mindset strategy tactical. Right. So I give him that hour presentation where, you know, I had a standing ovation for 10 minutes and said, just extract that and make it a chapter. So I tried to take a shortcut and I gave him all these chapters and they put it together and we were like literally three months away from when I told everybody I was releasing it and I got the book and I just hated it. I like absolutely hated it. And what forced me to have this, what I'm going to share with you now was that I had to write that. I wrote that whole book from beginning to end, um, really in about 45 days, like a year to get to something I just threw away. I paid the fee. The guy's fee was ridiculous. I paid the fees. I didn't want to argue with them. Um, and here's what I did. So we all have, and maybe you've taught something like this, but this is what I, this is what I created writing a book quick. And it's exactly how I wrote, um, the underdog advantage is we all have riffs that we call it whatever you want, things that you love talking about. If I said Russell right now, um, tell me the art behind a good ad or tell me the science behind a funnel or I know your, I've heard so many of your great frameworks, frameworks, frameworks, frameworks, riffs, whatever you want to call it. Right. When I love watching your epiphany, I used it in one of my shows cause after you said it, it stuck with me cause I remember I hadn't epiphany. Right. If I said, do you tell me what it's like, once you're at a epiphany bridge, come in and like, you can go, right? So what I think of is what are the seven to 12 frameworks or riffs that I love talking about that should be in this book. So I identify them. Let's say the underdog advantage. I knew I wanted to talk about the power of you can't, you know, most underdogs are told by everybody, you don't have the money at all the time, you don't, wrong. Like, but underdogs know how to turn that and make it into fuel. Right. Underdogs usually lack resources and learn to be resourceful. So I said, I love talking about how underdogs are massively, you know, are resourceful, are, are relentlessly resourceful. Right. Underdogs know how to turn desperation into persuasion. So I came up with these things that I love talking about and literally were in my phone. I would literally just go in my notes and I wrote down all the chapter heads. So they're really my riffs, but they're going to become my chapters. So then instead of saying, okay, these are my chapters. Let me start writing. What I did is I'd pick a chapter on a day I felt inspired and I would take my voice memo and I would record. I've done it on the side of the road when I felt inspired. I did it. I did one of the chapters. I was in the shower one day thinking about something and I'm like, oh my God, and I got out of the shower in a towel and I recorded for an hour that chapter. Right. So I go over a few months, I recorded every chapter and as I would record them, I'd send them out to get them transcribed. Right. So I recorded them, got them transcribed, got back and then I'd go clean up because talking is different than writing. I'd clean it up and then I had this piece of the puzzle and I didn't know where they're like, where I, instead of trying to decide to do them all in order, I just had all these pieces. So once I recorded all seven or eight chapters, they were transcribed and cleaned up. They were like all the pieces of the puzzle were in front of me. And I remember one day on a whiteboard, it's like, oh man, you want resourcefulness after this and this one should go here and underdogs don't have to care what other people think. Oh, I love that. I actually go here and then I just piece them around and then all of a sudden I had like seven chapters in a row and then my job was to weave the first chapter into the second. Right. So I'd, I'd take the end of chapter one, I'd change it so it flowed into chapter two and then I would flow it into the chapter and it was pretty much. Trans people through the whole book. Right. And then pull people in and the last part of each chapter, I want to write like sales copy copy to keep pulling them through the book. Right. And then when those were done, not trying to oversimplify it, but it was the easiest book I ever wrote then when those were done, I wrote the introduction because it made sense. And then the conclusion made sense. And it was just compared to any other book I've ever written, those millionaire success habits and yeah, they were easier. They're still not easy. I mean, I'm still working with a writer. I get done and send it to him and he'd like, this isn't fit. And so it was great to have advice, but as far as the easiest book ever was this last one. So one thing I think a lot of people sit down and their thoughts, I'm going to write a book and they spend like a year writing the book, going deep into the concepts and the writer, they get it done. And then they're like, all the pain of the work is done. Like, okay, how am I going to sell it? Now all I got to do is sell it. I'm curious about your year process. But I know for me as I'm writing the book the whole time, I'm thinking about this cover image. Like, like we spent two days to get this picture. Like I'm thinking about that. I'm thinking about the funnel with the upsells and down like the crosses and the box and like, like as I'm writing all the stuff and then by the time the book's done, like my whole thing's like, like they want to go build a funnel. I'm like, then they ask, they're trying to brainstorm the funnel. I mean, I spent two years brainstorming. I don't need your opinion. I got to exactly. And I remember when, I think it was one of the first times we hung out and you showed me your studio. I was like, oh my gosh, I'm in the studio and it was before your book had launched. And you're like, yeah, we shot an infomercial for this book and like, it's killing it. I'm like, oh cool. Like when is the book live launch? And you're like, well, I need to go write it still. I'm like, what do you mean you need to go write? Like you just filmed the infomercial and you're like, no, I filmed it first to make sure people are going to buy it before I, and it was so, I was backwards and most people's brain. I was just like, oh my gosh, I totally get that because you know how much goes into it. It's like, you want to make sure that the market wants it. If you can't sell it, even people on my team will come to an idea and like sell me on it. If they can't sell it, right? What's the sense of doing it, right? So millionaire success habits. I filmed the infomercial with Larry King before the book was written and then I ran ads money to it. And when they called, we said, hey, you're part of the test. Thanks for being part of the test when the book's done. We'll send it to you for free. But I knew I needed a certain amount of calls to make it was real. And when it worked, it gave me more motivation to write the book. But so here's, here's three things I want to say about that. One is I watch even our dear friends and successful people take two years, write a great book, painstake over it. And they have that Kevin Costner from Feel the Dreams. If I write it, they will come, right? And they won't. You could Google it, but the stat is in Barnes & Noble, only 5% of the books sell over a thousand copies, right? So how many great books are in there that people took years, extracted their life story, their pain, their like everything. And they just said I'll write it. They might even got a publishing deal, but nothing happens. So I don't think it's, it's, it's a must that while you're writing, like as I'm writing the book, I'm like, oh, that would be a great hook. And I have two pages over always when I'm writing, either my phone in my notes section or my computer, I will go, oh God, I got a, I got a lean in this. That's got to be a hook. And then so I will the whole time I'm writing, I'm thinking of the marketing plan and thinking how this aligns. Because at the end of the day, we can write great books, but we don't impact people's lives unless they buy them. That's probably the best advice you gave. And I would suggest to anybody as much effort and energy you're putting into writing the book, you really got to double that on how to sell the book. Yeah. So my other question I had for you is, I know in Millionaire Success Havets came out, all your books probably that were all primarily sold through Infomercials, right? That was the platform, the distribution channel. And this one came out and you have Infomercial, but you didn't, it wasn't like 100% in on Infomercial. You guys step back and it took you a while to figure out the whole internet thing. And then you went and sold, you know, close to a million copies now through online. I'd love to talk about just that process and what you learned in the process. I think a lot of, mostly we'll have the background first off on TV and they only have this internet. And they still can't figure it out. And what were the things you learned in that journey to figure out how to sell? So, you know what I think I have an unfair advantage. I have an unfair advantage because TV is brutal and it's brutally expensive, right? When I hear people say, oh man, I've been testing ads all week and they're like, man, I put three grand into this ad, it's still not converting. Like, are you joking? Like in Infomercial you could be 150 grand in before you know you get one order, right? You got to produce a great show, get a higher talent, get it edited, you got to make a deal with the stations. You got to spend 20, 30 grand to know if you got a winner. You got to book that media way out in advance. You got to hire a call center to answer every phone call. You got to write a script for the upsells and get them to convert. Like the complexity, I didn't know anything different so I didn't know it was complex at the time. And now when I, you know, and I was late to online because my Infomercials had done so well. I was ignoring social media up until three years ago, right? But when I went over and went into social media, it just seemed so easy to me like, I could test something today and know tomorrow. Like you're complaining. Like I did marketing through smoke signals and horse and buggy. Like you're complaining because you got to spend 100 bucks on a Facebook ad. So what I think it gave me Russell is, and I think it gave me marketing stamina. Like I know it's eventually going to work. There's zero doubts in my mind. I just know I got to get through sometimes a lot of what doesn't work to get to what does. And we all know that, but I just think everybody gives up way too easy. So I'll give you, so, you know, five books in a row were all real estate based. Real estate was my life and changed my life. And now I wrote a book, Millionaire Success Habits, because I wanted to give people the habits for success. And I have to tell you, when we launched it, a bunch of friends jumped in, did pretty well. But then when the friends were gone and I wanted to make it evergreen, I'm not kidding you. We were, I was probably four months in selling 200 books a week. And it just wasn't working. And I'm like, I started, and I have to be honest, I started questioning. Like maybe everybody knows me as the real estate guy. You know, but like if you, if they knew me, they knew I'm personal growth about self education. And I'm like, maybe it's that, and I started telling myself, and this gave me more empathy for people who struggle. I started telling myself the things that I bet you most people do when it comes to marketing. That's only for the big people like Russell and Facebook's new algorithms, screw job or YouTube. Man, you got to have this. And like we come up, because I started feeling it. And then I just dug back in. I'm like, no, it's an amazing book. But there was a moment I just tried and muffed enough ads. So I want to share something. We went months selling a couple hundred books a week. And in one day, one day, we went to a thousand books in a week. And then the next day we were on track for 3000. By the, by the fifth day, we were at a thousand to 2000 books a day. So it went like this and then like this, right? So the part I want to share is the book cover didn't change. The title didn't change. The words didn't change. Our landing page didn't change. Our funnel didn't even change. Nothing changed except the messaging in the ads. And, but it took me probably 50 ads and four months. You got the message. And then I got the message right. And for me, what the message was with millionaire success habits was the truth. It's like, how many magical money machines have you looked into, bought, and how's that working for you? And maybe if you have the greatest opportunity in the world, it didn't work out for you. Why? Not because of the tactics, not even because of the strategy. Because you didn't have a mindset for success. Why do people that hit Lotto go broke because they had the money, the resources, but they didn't have the mindset to handle that kind of money? So I said, all millionaire success habits is, is it goes upstream and anchors a foundation for success that I learned through myself and surrounded by great people. And that new messaging, and I've done a million variations of that, it just resonated. And all of a sudden it was just like the team was like, dude, we sold a thousand books last night. What just happened? Dude, what happened? Like, and, and it's like the algorithms didn't change. It was just that. And yeah, it was crazy. This was with our book with ClickFunnels. We had the same thing. Like we first launched it. It was like, it was a dud. And I couldn't figure out why. And I was like trying to fix the funnels, everything. And it was like, try number two, number three, number four, number five, and like number six is when I got the message right. And it was just like, as soon as that happened, it was just like, just took off and we went from hard-leaning sales at all to then like, I think within seven to 14 days of us, me nailing the message, we passed a million dollars in sales. It was just like, you get software didn't change. The process, it was just the messaging. I think most people give up before they ever get great at it. And you know what most people say to me, if someone has a book that doesn't sell, they're like, maybe just people don't want a book about this. Like, and that's a delusion, right? Like we're delusion to think it's the product, it's the book. Man, I shouldn't name the, I've heard people say, maybe the title was kind of janky. I'm like, no, it wasn't. I read the book. It's amazing. You just don't, you're not elaborating that message in a way where people see the value and you just got to have the stamina to keep going. Dean, let's talk about distribution. How do you, it's obviously evolved and shifted throughout time. I think even most people's minds, Amazon is like where books are at. But for me personally, we still sell most of our books not through Amazon. Here's like your thoughts on how it's shifted. What I think is, Amazon can be, great Amazon sales can be the byproduct of good direct response marketing. Right? So we were number one, at one point with millionaire success habits, we were number one in three categories. Like entrepreneurship and two other ones. And we weren't pushing anybody to Amazon because we were running so many ads that the people see the ads then go to Amazon and get the book. So, I mean, let's just face it, book distribution has changed. It's changed because it hasn't changed. It changed. Borders went out of business. Some people don't even know what borders is. Barnes & Noble, who knows how long they can last, right? Because they haven't changed their model. Book publishers haven't changed their model in a long time to keep up with growing trends, right? They're looking for the, book publishers are looking for the influencers that already have the following to latch on and, and give them that. So, I think the world has changed. The world is ready to buy books direct. I'll just tell you, my strategy is similar to yours. I write a book, create the hardcover, the look, feel as if it's a published book, right? And it's the quality of a published book. Because I published five, four of them. But we run through direct response, right? So running ads, driving them to a page, whether that's free plus shipping and we give great value. And then if people buy additional products and services from us, if we can cover the ad spend within a week or two, then that's a winning campaign. Because a byproduct is lots of Amazon sales, byproduct is people are introduced to our company and what we stand for and they could buy more stuff for us. And the cool part is you can get direct distribution, right? I've had a distribution company doing all my printing and all my sending out books for 12 years, right? And that's, that's readily available. The mystery of the book industry is no more mystery, right? You can create your own Amazon account, you could run an ad on Facebook. Yeah, so I just think that that world has changed. Now, I understand if you want a New York Times bestseller title, you got to go through traditional. I have a couple New York Times bestsellers, so I don't need to do that. And then I'll tell you the last thing would happen millionaire success habits with Hay House. So I think great guys, reads an awesome dude over there. I sold about a half a million copies on my own and then read came to me and said, let me publish after a half a million copies. And I said, sure, give me a deal, but I'm not changing what I do. I'm still going to sell direct response. He goes, yeah, do what you do, brother. I'll just put it in every bookstore. So now that it's in, now that I went and published with him, if you go to any Amazon store right now, millionaire success habits is still on the top business books. It's been on for like almost a year now. But we just do what we do. And so we got the best of both worlds on that one. So one of the new things our funnel will be testing. We did this with our supplement funnel back in the day. We found that a lot of people buying supplements were older, so they were scared of buying online. So our exit pop was like, hey, if you're nervous to buy online, click here to go to our Amazon store and buy it. And they're like, oh, they feel comfortable Amazon. I don't know why in the last two books I haven't done this, but the new book funnel when you come to you leave the exit pop is pushing back to Amazon store to get Amazon. I'm going to put that in mind now as soon as you're done. I know. I'm so excited for that. Anyway, we're redoing all three book funnels right now. And I've been geeking out so deep on it. It's going to be amazing. That's awesome. Anyway, I think a lot of people, and I get this from just even friends, I know, like people still buy books. Like, a book's still a thing. Like, you know, like they don't, a lot of people don't believe it's still a, still a tange. Like this is the business model. Like I watch fun YouTube, I read blogs or whatever. Like what are your thoughts? Like are books still the right vehicle that can be around long term or what's your thoughts on it? I think so. I mean, maybe because it's, I still listen to a book about every two weeks, a book on audio. I just think there's so many treasures in a book and still to this day, I've been blessed to have a lot of accomplishments, right? Started 13 different companies. I've done more things that I could ever imagine possible. I own, I bought thousands of houses, like multiple, you know, all these different things. But still, if someone introduces me on a podcast, you know what they'll say? New York Times best selling author. Multiple New York Times best selling author, Dean Greziosi. There's just something that gives so much credibility to a book because people know you have to know your stuff. You got to sit down, take the time, effort and energy to write it. It's not just a quick, and I love quick vlogs or blogs or YouTube content and podcasts. I love all that, but there's, I don't know, there's some like underlying value credibility of a book. And maybe that's just our age and older. I'm a little older than you, so I'd love me in with you. But maybe that's our age and older and maybe in next generation won't value it as much. But listen, millionaire success habits heading towards a million copies. And I think underdog advantage will do the same. I think people still want it. They just want good ones. I had a similar, I've been publishing for a decade, 10 years in my career. I've been doing blogs and video and podcast and like, you know, as prolific as I could be with as much stuff. And I was sitting at dinner one night with one of my friends. We watched our kids play, where Carl's Jr., our kids play on the playground. We're hanging out watching him and he said, Do you know the difference between you and like Tony Robbins or Brendan Ruchard or these other guys? I'm like, what? He's like, I feel like like your same level, your content is good. They seem more legit than you because they all have a book. He's one of my best friends. And I was just like, huh, that was the night. Like literally that night is the night that I started writing my book. Yeah. So I believe that to be true. I've been doing all this stuff. I've been putting my heart and soul out there, but there's legitimacy of like, this is, Yeah. Someone's willing to put in the effort to get something like that. It's just the next level of like, of determination of mastery, whatever you want to call it. Yeah. So I would say the last part I would say this. I think everybody should write a book, but if you want to get in the information age, you want to help other people, there's faster ways. You might want to get in with doing a monthly zoom call, a monthly live training online, right? Do a workshop, do a mastermind, gain the capabilities. You'll be able to rehearse it in real time. You know, you get people on a podcast or you get people on a live zoom call and you say stuff. It's like jokes, like funny jokes, not so funny. Throw away the not so funny or the not so impactful things. And after a year of doing training like that, you have all the content for your book and you get to do the best of the best in your book. I always tell people, when I wrote my first book, it was, I was in business 10 years and I always tell people like, like, why are you writing it earlier? I'm like, I wasn't ready earlier. Like I had to learn it and I had to earn it. I would say it took me 10 years to earn this book. This book took me two years of me like, geeking out, studying, going deeper than you ever do to like, earn the book. And I think you're right.
