OHros Alright, so Miles and I are about ready to head out and we're heading down to Boise State. Miles, can you tell me what we're going to be doing at Boise State today? We are presenting the Guinness World Record plaque for the largest bubble soccer game. It is my distinct pleasure to present the Guinness World Records certificate to Russell, Dave and Todd, the executive management team of plaque bubbles. Congratulations! You are officially amazing! We're going to have Coach Harcin there, we're going to have the AD for Boise State, we're going to have a bunch of media there so right now we're trying to compile this, adding up numbers and everything so we're cutting it close like we always do. What's up? Let's go! So these are the plaques that actually we presented here. Click funnels, Guinness World Record. Alright Miles, game on buddy. Are you nervous? Game time. Dude, you don't have the plaques. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. That would be an important thing. Okay, hey we're approved for the parking. We're approved? Oh good. Here we are, Boise State Stadium on the blue. It's a big old stadium when you're down below it. Alright, hopefully we don't screw this up. I only got one shot at it. We love that. Congratulations. This is the new age of the place where I've been. My name is Dave Woodward, I'm the Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Business Development Officer for Quick Bubbles. So we set the world record here on the blue. We want to thank Coach Arson for allowing us to use his field and most importantly obviously for Boise State all they do for the community. Congratulations, thank you so much. Thank you very much. We appreciate this and click funnels and for Boise State. This is a great award and honor and we love to see records being broken. We hope we can continue that. So thank you very much. Thanks Coach. Okay I have to say this is like the weirdest webinar day I've ever experienced here in our office. It is like quiet. It's really really weird but literally within an hour and 15 minutes the thing is taken off so let's kind of figure out what's going on. But quiet is in here. It's gone before the storm. What's happening? It's a webinar coming. A webinar is coming. A webinar. I've never seen this happen before. It's like Russell's not even having to work on his power points or anything else. It's like a weird feeling. I'm done. I retired officially, came down in charge. Being a tracky character for the phone planks. Look how quiet it is in here. Jamie's busting out trying to make sure this thing actually works. Don't say anything. Soren is busy. Bat line signals up. What's going on? Ready? We're all set. Getting ready. Getting ready. Glasses are on. Pumping it out. Miles is just typing away like crazy. Look at Brent crushing it over here. This is just like, I've never seen an office this quiet before a huge webinar. This is really, really, really bizarre. John's sitting here making sure everything's working and ready to go here in an hour. It's so cold. We're getting so close. Do you want to see how many registrations we have? How many we got? 7,648. I'm getting close to eight. My goal is 8,000 in an hour. We got to get there. So we're talking about literally the evolution of the attractive character and groundbreaking craziness that's happening, literally less than like 45 minutes. Well so we're just talking about how there's this common belief in the business community that if you are the face of the business, like Russell's the face of ClickFunnels, right? Like if you're that person, then you're always going to be inextricably linked to the business and you're never going to be able to pull yourself out and you're always going to have to be the attractive character and it's like, ah, it's so cool, but then you get stuck and then this guy creates the ultimate way of doing this. So this is the deal. I get all the time, like, you know, attractive character doesn't work for you on a sale, your business doesn't work for a lifestyle brand. Personally, I'm like, okay, so like four years ago when we were launching ClickFunnels, I thought about that. I'm like, okay, how do I sell ClickFunnels someday if we wanted to? Not that I'm going to, but if we wanted to, if Russell is ClickFunnels, then it's not going to sell. So this was the thought and I know how we're going to execute it. I just knew that like I couldn't be the attractive character all the time. I had to be the initial momentum and growth, but then how do you like make, how do you bring in other attractive characters? Like what's the next level of that? And so it's crazy. These last three and a half years we've been training tons of people in our community to do the perfect webinar, to do my webinar pitch. They all have their own stories now. They have their own thing. And so this is the first time we've done it where Kaylin basically took my offer, but her doing the webinar with her own style or in storage or in everything, but she has to use my offer and she's doing the whole webinar today. And so when she does it, she's going to crush it and I'll have Russell has a presentation. Kaylin's got a presentation. Now there's two people that are selling ClickFunnels and eventually we have a third person and a fourth and a fifth and then 12. And then what's cool about it is that there's 12 attractive characters and I'm one of many and if I want to sell it, I can just step away. My presentation still stands on its own, but I'm one of a whole bunch of success students. So the magic is that you are the attractive character initially, but long term your clients are your attractive characters. So amazing. It's, that's the secret and then you've got a whole foundation of them and that's the magic. If you do your job right and you actually serve them and change their lives, they become the attractive characters and not you. For those who really want to get deep into marketing doctrine here. So if you notice my language patterns have lasted eight months or so, no longer I just talk about like Brandon and Kaylin, my success stories. I talk about the success stories of the success stories. I talk about Brandon and Kaylin having a great business, but what's even more important is the fact that over 1.3 million women lose weight. So the success stories of your success stories become the third level of the attractive character. I talk about Pamela Weibull. She's awesome, but what's really amazing is the doctor's life. She's saved the third tier. That's the next level of where this whole magic Mrs. Goan. Drop that mic. Caboosh. I actually started doing the demo. It's like perfect because it's like, you know, it's not so slow. It makes it look like it's alive. Oh, that's good. You gotta have the dog. The panelists are go to more and turn off their ability to raise their hands. It'll drive you crazy. All right, we're watching Kaylin close the webinar now. Everyone's in here. We had, I happened on the big screen right here. She is killing it. We're all watching. Anyway, Kaylin's a way better pitch person than me. She's not even officially retiring. She's not even in the video. Anyway, Kaylin's a way better pitch person than me. She's not even officially retiring. She's now in charge of ClickFunnels and it's amazing. Anyway, it's so much fun watching this. All right, just wrapped up the first one of Hopefully Mini to Come. What do you think? She killed it. What? I haven't seen somebody do over 100K in a webinar besides me. Like, live, live. Like that was, that's very, very rare, very rare. She freaking blew past it. This will be at least half a million dollars before the end of the campaign, which is crazy. Unbelievable. For last take. That was amazing. Oh, way to go, Kaylin. That was awesome. All right, so we got a brand new box coming in today. We'd love anytime we get these boxes and especially when they're from us. Actually, so I want to show you some of the new things that are going out from our two comic up coaches out to all of our two comic club members. Two comic up X. Check this out. Big old box. Open that bad boy up. What do you see? The two comic club X, a special gift. And thank you from Russell Brunson and the two comic club coaches. So then you open this bad boy up and what? They clopped to opomo binder. Check out the size of this bad boy. Man, that's a lot of newsletters. Years worth of content. Super, super excited for this thing. Open it up. And what do we have? Our very first newsletter. Welcome to the two comic club X newsletter. Plata opomo. Boom. Check that out. Issue number uno. So this is going to be one of the main things we want to make sure all of our two comic club X members get. They started receiving things on a regular basis from us. This helps us increase our stick strategies. But more important, it provides them massive content to help them get what we want more than anything else. That's 500 people. From a two comic club X program, walk in the cross stage next year receiving the two comic club program. Plack and hopefully some of those hitting the X.
