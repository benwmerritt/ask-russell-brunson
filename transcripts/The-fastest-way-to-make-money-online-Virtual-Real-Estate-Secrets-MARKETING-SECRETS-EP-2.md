## Transcript
This we have to understand so many of you guys are sitting back and you're waiting. You're waiting for your click funnels. You're like, okay, but someday I'm gonna get the idea. It's gonna be amazing. You're waiting and you're waiting and you're waiting. It's like, we gotta get you in the game. Again, I told people before, like, click funnels was my 150th funnel that we launched. If I would have waited for this to be the very first funnel I would have launched, I'd never have been worthy to find this. Hey, this is Russell Brunson. You are listening to the Marketing Seekers Podcast where you're gonna learn different ways to market, integrate your company. In today's episode, we're gonna be covering what we call virtual real estate. I've been talking about a whole bunch of cool things from like, how do you wholesale funnels? How do you license funnels? How to fix the flip funnels? How to buy and hold funnels? How do you create financing deals? And how to find virtual real estate funnels that you can use to grow your core company? There's a lot of really cool things we're covering during today's episode. I want you guys, as you're listening today, show to think of an intention. Like, as you're listening to this, don't just listen for like enjoyment. I want you to enjoy the episode. I want you to think like, how can I use this in something I'm doing, right? And this could be simple as like looking at the funnels you have maybe aren't working as well. And how can you use these strategies to make them better, right? Instead of finding a company and flipping it and fixing it up and things like that. Like how can you apply these principles to your own company, right? Number two is if you don't have a business agenda, you're struggling or you're in the middle of trying to grow something big. This could be a fun weekend project or side gig you do, just kind of have some fun growing a business. And so have some intentions like, how can I use this, either for my existing business or how can I use this as a side business? Or maybe it's a business you do with your kids. I recently, I ended up not buying it, but I almost bought the sock company because I thought it'd be really fun to do with my kids and would have been a perfect virtual real estate company that I could do with them to give them a side project to learn these marketing principles. So having intentions, you go through this of like, how could you actually use this in your real life? And on top of that, if you enjoy this episode, please rate and review it.

So with that said, you guys, I hope you enjoy this episode of the Marketing Secrets podcast. You're listening to Marketing Secrets with your host, Russell Brunson. All right. So on today's episode, I want to talk about a concept that we call virtual real estate. And this is not a phrase I made up. In fact, a lot of things I do nowadays are things that really smart marketers are doing when I first got started online and then they stopped doing it and I bought the ideas or the principles or the concepts from them. So when I got started way back almost 20 years ago, one of the big things that was the hot topic like the shiny object of the day was Google AdSense. Kind of like we've got crypto as the shiny object today and if T is the shiny, there's always something right? That's like the new hot thing everyone's focusing on and that's where their attention's at. And so if you rewind back in time 18, 20 years ago when I first got into this game, the big shiny object was Google AdSense. And what was happening is that people could create these websites and they were like really ugly websites because the reason is you made money when not when somebody spent time on your site, you made money when someone came to your site and then they saw AdSense, they click on the AdSense link and left, that's how you made money. So literally the whole concept is make these really ugly sites getting ranked really high in Google for competitive keywords and then you make money every time someone would come to your page and they would leave. And I had friends making 50, 60, 100,000, 200,000, $300,000 a month by making these crappy, ugly websites. And I remember at the time, John Rhys came out and he was one of the guys who was making a ton of money doing this and he coined the term virtual real estate or VRE. He said, he started saying you got to create these VRE properties, these virtual real estate properties and each property you set up this site, you get a ranked in Google and it makes $500,000 a month, right? He said you make one and then you create a second one and a third one. And I remember back in the day, people came out with different software programs that would make these sites even faster for you. And that had friends like David Fry, who went and he built a whole team. He had a, in his, in his basement of his house, I think, or maybe his office, he had this like production where it's like all these high school kids come home from high school and they have computers and there was like, I don't know, maybe 20 or 30 computers in the room. And the first guy, all his job was to go buy domains. So he had above his desk, he had this checklist, like step one, two, three, like, and the guy would come home from school, sit down, he would just buy domains and then go to the guy number two and the second desk was like, Hey, your job is to go and do these five steps. And he had like a whiteboard with like the five steps for that guy. And the next thing he built, like literally a shop of people that would just come in and they'd buy domain, set it up, run traffic equalizer, do the backlinks, do the thing. And they would just mouse producing. So he was creating 10, 20, 30 of these sites a day and ranking them and getting paid money. And it was like this, it was like buying virtual real estate, right? It was like buying, going to Boise, I don't know, before his Boise and buying all the property and setting up houses and then playing Monopoly, right? And then as all good things do, they come to an end. Google slapped it. They stopped paying out these things and it stopped being profitable. They stopped ranking sites that were ugly. The only goal was to keep people to leave because they wanted to rank sites that had good content and things like that. And so the whole industry kind of disappeared overnight. And I always thought about this in our world of funnels and building businesses that a lot of times, and I'm probably one of the people that causes this, right? Like I'm all about like building a business that you're passionate about, that you love, that you can like change the world and you can do all these things, right? Like read expert secrets all about like creating a mass movement of people, you can change their lives and how do you do that? And I still believe that. Like that's what my mission is, what ClickFunnels is. But I think sometimes I probably overwhelm people because some people like, I just try to figure out and make an extra 100 bucks or an extra 500 bucks. Like how do I do that? There is a time and a place for that. So at last year's Funnel Hacking Live, I did a special nighttime session and I called it virtual real estate secrets. In fact, the subtitle was, how to build a virtual real estate empire by fixing, flipping and investing in small cash flow funnels. And it was really fun because before that event, I wanted to show people that, you know, while I still think that everybody should be building a business that's literal goal is to go and change the world, there is a time and a place like, let me build a virtual real estate property where I can create an offer, set up a funnel, drive some traffic to it. It pays me 500 bucks a month or 200 bucks a month or whatever that is. And maybe I create two or three or 10 of those things and they're all cash flowing and I can have a really good business doing that as well. And so I wanted to share this as episode number two of the new podcast. And the reason why is because a lot of my episodes are going to be showing the VRE, the virtual estate that I'm doing behind the scenes. And so I wanted to, to give that to you guys as kind of a context. So as I start showing you guys more of these things, you know, what we're doing and why we're doing, but you got some of the strategies as well. Cause a lot of you guys like, you've been following me for a long time. You've been listening to the podcast episodes, how many episodes have we done to mark these secrets? 551 episodes prior to this. And then the marketing of your car, that's like what almost 800 episodes, a lot of you guys have binged through all of them. You've read the books, you've been to Funnel Hacking Live, you've done the stuff. And, uh, and maybe you don't have a business yet. Maybe you're struggling trying to build the empire and have the mass movement. It's like, look, you have the skill sets right now that you can go and you can create these little properties. You can find sites that are making a hundred bucks a month and get a making 500 bucks a month because you know, you have the skill set you've seen the thing to apply it towards. And so hopefully this will be fun. This was a fun presentation. I think it was lighter, it was enjoyable. People had a great time with it. Um, with that said, we're going to take you guys back to Funnel Hacking Live 2021. Take some notes and let's start building your own virtual real estate empire. Together and welcome back to the stage, Mr. Russell Brunson. So today's been a lot of fun. We've gone deep on a lot of topics, a lot of stuff. And typically after the first day, one, number one, everyone feels a little bit overwhelmed, like, Oh my gosh, that was crazy. That was only half a day. We got three more days of this stuff, right? So I want to do this special session. This is something I've never taught before. I think about this a lot. I talk about it with my team a lot. There's a lot of ways to make money in this business. It's not just, I'm going to do, you know, build this huge empire. A lot of times you can do it smaller. You can do it in a way that's, that's just a little bit differently. So that's what I want to talk about today. So my title of my presentation is actually virtual real estate secrets. How to build a virtual real estate empire by fixing, flipping and investing in small cash flow funnels to kind of lead this one off. Obviously I use the word virtual real estate and some people are like, wait, you're talking about building houses or you're talking about selling houses on the internet? Like, no, I'm talking about properties, virtual properties. How do we make money with virtual properties, virtual funnels, right? And not so much like how to make millions of millions of dollars, but how do I make some revenue? How to make cash flow from little funnels? Cause yes, I'm so excited. Like I might try and teach you guys how to build funnels. We're going to make you tens of millions of dollars. And like that's like what gets me excited, but how many of us would be really excited if you had a funnel is making you, I don't know, a couple hundred, a couple thousand bucks a month. How many of us have you had two of those or three or 10 or 50 of them? Right? So that's what I'm talking about here, just to kind of give you guys something to think about. And maybe this is for you. Maybe it's for one of your kids. Maybe it's for a spouse or maybe it's for somebody you know, but I think it'd be fun topic just to talk about inside of our community. Cause we don't talk about these things a lot. Now when I think about real estate, I think about HGTV, right? I think about all the TV shows where they are like literally doing this with properties and there have been real estate gurus teaching how to make money in real estate for way before I was ever born, right? And I was talking to Joe McCall, who I think is here somewhere in the room. Joe's one of my interstitial members and someone who I just have so much respect for. In fact, I got in trouble. I bought a whole bunch of real estate that I shouldn't have. And Joe magically got me out of it. So I love that guy. And I messaged him ahead of time. I said, like, he's one of the big real estate gurus, a whole bunch of real estate gurus, like what are the core ways that in the real estate world, they're teaching people how to make money. And he said, well, there's a lot of things, a lot of different angles and stuff, but he's like, it really comes down to four core things, right? And this is traditional real estate. So one is wholesaling. That's where you find someone that may not want to sell the house, but they need to sell their house. Right? Maybe they're going through a divorce or maybe, um, you know, something tragic lost their job or something. They'd have to get out of their house. And so there's opportunities where real estate gurus teach people how to do wholesaling to get a property and to sell it or to flip it or whatever. Right. So that was the first thing. The second one, this is what's, uh, you see all over HGTV, right? The fix and flip where they find a house and they're like, oh, this house is horrible. And then they get the new kitchen and the new, like all the things, all of a sudden they got this beautiful house and then they sell it and they flip it, right? Um, and then there's buy and hold where you buy a house, you fix it up. And then instead of selling it, you just hold it and you cashflow it. Right. And the last one that he kind of mentioned was creative financing. There's a lot of different ways to do cool creative financing, no money down and things like that. And so as I do this presentation, I was like, okay, these are ways that people do money in traditional real estate. Right. Like how does this relate to, to kind of what we do as internet nerds? I mean, internet marketers, right? Um, and for me, the law, I guess I don't know this. I actually got my start, uh, when I was in college, my dad actually bought me this book, rich dad, poor dad. Who here's read this book? Okay. Uh, this book was one of those things that was like the trade, like the turning point in my life. Um, I was in my house, my wife and I just got married. We're in this little house. We live in there and he gave me the book and this book sat on the next to my, um, bed for months and months and months. And then finally one day I couldn't fall asleep. I look over and I'm like, oh, I hate reading. There's a book my dad gave me. He's going to ask me next time I see him. Fine. I'll read. So I opened up and I start reading the book and I got hooked. Um, again, this is like one of the best books ever. So I read the entire book that night. I can't sleep. I'm at the wheels, my head are spinning. I'm sitting there like this wide awake next morning. My wife wakes up and rolls over and she's like, cool. I'm like, Hey, she's like, what's going on? I'm like, um, we're going to buy a duplex. Like what? Yeah, we're going to live in one half and run out the other half and we're going to live for free and we have tons of extra money. It's going to be amazing. And my lovely wife said, okay. And then we went and we bought our very first, uh, property within like a week or two after reading this book. And this was our first house we owned together. We bought it. We lived in the top and there was a basement apartment that we rented out. And, um, this was our very first, uh, house ever. And, um, no, I was excited. Cause I thought that was one of my futures buying real estate and investing and stuff like that, but we had problems. Uh, the problems were, uh, these things called renters. Anyone here have had renter before? It was really bad. And, um, it wasn't just one bad thing. It was like bad thing after another. And I'm sure you guys all have stories, but, um, after about two or three months in this place, we're like, we do not want to have renters, let alone in our house living below us because it's even worse. Right. And I was like, well, that was how it was going to make money. I got to figure something else out. Right. And that's kind of got my will spinning. And this is really how I started cutting, getting into the internet business during this time of my life. Um, but this house, we had to fix it up. So I was trying to do the whole flip, flip and fix thing. So, um, this is my buddy Nate and I, and we had to learn a whole bunch of skills. I found this picture that a, we learned how to, how to do sheet rock, tile, painting and landscaping. We literally went to a home depot and I was like, I need some tile there. How many I'm like, uh, like a couple of boxes, like two. I'm like, sure. So I got the boxes and then we needed like, like stirring up the plaster and we're putting it down and we're slapping things over. And all the tile starts like shifting and moving around. Like, oh, so we call the home depot. He's like, dude, the tile is like shifting. He's like, well, how much, um, how much of the mortars you put down? Like a lot. He's like, you don't put a lot down. I'm like, Oh, is like, you need these little things to like keep the squares. So we like race back and bought the little, the little, the little teas. Like space it out. But by that time it already hardened it. It was like, it was horrible. And the tile was like wavy and people were tripping on it. It was bad. It was really bad. But in theory, you guys understand that's how this works, right? You find a property, it's beat up. You learn how to tie it, you know, how to sheetrock, you know, to paint, you make it nice and you go from before to after you sell it, you make a ton of money. Right. And, or if you decide you want to keep it, the opposite of that is you go create a property and then, or you get a property, you get in that all nice. You get a property management company, you plug it in and then you're done. Right. That was the dream I was sold to real estate was like, literally get a house, hire property management company. The house is going to cash flow you $1,000 a month. You pay the property management company $200 a month and you get $800 a month for free for doing nothing. Right. I was like, this is the most amazing thing in the world. But again, we had renters and it wasn't ideal for us in our marriage. And so we didn't do more real estate after this, but that was kind of the concept. Right. So I want to explain that because I'm not talking about real estate with you guys, but I want you to understand that these principles, these concepts are the same when we start transitioning over to virtual real estate. Okay. With virtual real estate, the goal I'm trying to try to create these funnels, create these little funnels that I can go and I can create them and I can create them quickly. I create them in a weekend and create them, you know, over a couple of day period time, I set it up and then I go and I hire a Facebook ad agency, just like a property management thing. They drive ads to it and I'm done. I walk away and hopefully this thing cash flows a hundred bucks a month or 500 bucks a month or a thousand bucks a month, depending what the offer is. And for me, when I got started, literally my potato gun offer, you guys have all heard the story a bajillion times, but that was my mindset. I was like, I know the potato with the gun, things not going to be the biggest thing in the world. If I can get this thing making some money and every second one and a third one, these are like real estate properties only the digital and there's no renters. There's no plumbing. There's no broken tile. I just set it up. I buy some ads and it just runs itself. Right. So with the potato gun product, my initial goal, sorry, not my initial goal, but this one was making me when first launched about 30 bucks a day profit. And I was like, Oh my gosh, this is the coolest thing in the world. And I remember about that time is when I started thinking bigger, right? I'm like, I want to make a million dollars. How do you do that? And so I remember sitting down one day with a calculator, I said a million dollars divided by 365. I was like, what would take to make a million dollars a year? So I did the math. If you take a million dollars divided by 365, it equals $2,739.73 a day. Literally the best number in the world. And that was my goal. I said, okay, well, I'm making 30 bucks a day off my potato gun site. If I had another one that makes a hundred bucks, another one makes 200. And eventually I get a portfolio of these things. Just like people do with real estate. If I get a portfolio, collectively this portfolio might go where the point where it's making me a lot of money. Right. And that was my initial goal when I got in this business. That's why I last year's fun like lab, I showed you guys, I launched over 150 different funnels. This is what I was doing. I was creating one here and creating one here. And we're trying to set up these little properties. And what's cool is that some of them made really good money. Some of them flopped, but collectively as a whole, a bunch of them did. And then from that process of trying this one and trying this one and trying different ones, that's when the bigger opportunity started coming. Well, all of a sudden I got better. My skills got better. I built better funnels. Different opportunities came. And eventually I wasn't just building little duplexes. I started building mansions and started building things like this. Right. But I learned it. I got my skillset by doing these little virtual real estate properties. Okay. So that's what something I wanted to kind of proposed you guys are thinking through those who are in this phase, like, what can I do? What little things that I create that I can literally get it built out in a weekend, set it up, get a Facebook ad agency. And I can step back in this thing. Cash flows me a hundred bucks or 500 bucks a month. And I can do that again and just have some fun with this. That's why I call the dive a little deeper into that. Okay. So we're talking about real estate, the tools you gotta learn yet to learn how to do sheet rocking and tile and all these things to get a house right. Okay. In virtual real estate, the tools you have are all the things you guys have been learning about. Okay. Everything you learn here at funnel hiking live, everything you learn about when you read my books, like these are the tools you have to get to become good at, right? Catherine did a session today on funnels. So like this is the tool set. This is the skill set you got to learn just like you gotta learn to like do tile if you're doing the house, you learn to build a funnel. Okay. Jim talked about copy. That's what we did the copy workshop. Right. If, if you get good copy, that's a tool you're going to be using to build at least sites design ads traffic. These are all the different tools that we can use. Okay. And so over the last four or five months, I started having some fun with this. I knew I wanted to talk about this funnel hacking live this year. So I was like, I'm going to go and create a whole bunch of virtual real estate properties, um, just for fun, just to show you guys this case studies. And so I'm going to show you guys some, some of them are done, some are partially done, some of them are all sorts of different places, but I had so much fun creating these things. Um, so one of the first things I did is I was like, I need to go find, um, things that are for sale. I don't want to create something from scratch. Right. Like I don't go and I'm not going to go build a house from the ground up. Cause then I got to be like become a contractor and stuff like that. I was like, I want to go find a house, this for sale. I'm going to buy it and fix it and either flip it or sell it or whatever I'm going to do. Two places I went to initially to go buy websites, um, really, really quickly. And these are two that are awesome. So one of them is flip it.com and flip is a whole marketplace with tons and tons of people selling websites. The other one is called Shopify exchange. And they're like, I think 10,000 people who started Shopify stores, don't understand funnels or don't understand traffic or understand ads or copy or all the things you guys know. They did all the hard work to go and find the offers, contact the places, get all the whole, like the drop shipping set, get everything finished. And they can't make figure out how to drive traffic or make any money. And so they sell them on the site. And so I literally spent hours just going through and like, Oh, I could buy that one. Oh, and that one. They're like, Oh, and there's tons of them. And most of these people, again, they do all the hard work getting the, the, the website, the Shopify store done and ready. And then they don't know what to do with it. Like, uh, I'm going to sell it for a thousand bucks, 500 bucks, 10,000. Like there, there's all sorts of pricing. Um, so these are two places I went to and you guys can go there and just geek out and like look for cheap virtual real estate. And so that's kind of what I did in issues, going to the both these sites and start having some fun. Okay. And then my goal is to go through and look at these things and find a property that I can look at and say, Hey, my skills that I have right now, I know that I could actually get this thing to look good. Right. Now some of these sites are horrible and they're ugly, but some of them, I'm like, this side, like I get this and I can make money with this one. Okay. And so for you, um, what my goal is going to be for you guys tonight or this weekend, um, is to go to the sites and look through them and just see, like, based on what you've learned this weekend, like what are the things you can take and you can grab and you can start tweaking with. Okay. So I'm going to go through different sites and some of the fun projects I've been working on in my free time over the last couple of weeks. Okay. Case study. Number one, um, I've always wanted to start off tie company. Um, so I spent two years in New Jersey knocking on doors and I had to wear a, uh, a tie every single day. And so when all like you're wearing a white shirt and tie every single day, your ties, the only like color you have. And so like ties becomes only we would trade, we'd barter and like we fight over different ties, right? So we love good ties. And I remember, um, I had this, uh, this companion who was, uh, with me on my mission out there and he used to always say this thing. Um, he come out in his new tie. He's like, check this out and floss in this new tie. I was like, what? You're flossing new ties. Like, yeah, I'm flossing this new tie. And every day you come out and he's like, I'm flossing this new tie. And so I always want to start a tie company talking about flossing, uh, flossing ties. And so I wanted to tie company, but I don't know how to start a tie company. I don't know. I know any of these things, right? And so as I started going through, trying to find websites in the back of my mind, I've always known that I think it'd be fun to start a tie company someday. So I started going through and I started looking at all the things I've been learning and a couple of things that I've learned at the same time. Things that I've learned at funnel hacking live, uh, Perry Belcher spoke at a funnel hacking live and he showed his funnel. Have you guys seen this funnel before? This is funnel where he gives me credit card knives, but on the back end, he sells access to a membership site. This was another one of Perry's sites. Perry, uh, had a custom suit company. They said high end custom suits. And, uh, he wasn't driving traffic directly to the suit company. Instead, what he would do is he would go and he said to people that wear custom suits, they also happen to on what? Cuff links. So he's like, I made these cuff link funnels. Like give away free cuff links, ran Facebook ads, who people got free cuff links and then those leads came in and they started buying custom suits. I was like, sweet, cause I don't want to drive ads to a Thai store. It seems kind of hard and weird. And so as I was going through Flippa and I was scrolling through all of a sudden, I saw this site that was for sale and this was a site. Um, it was called dimpleclips.com. I think, and, uh, I looked at dimple clips and it was for sale for 19, so 19,500 bucks. And then these little, these little clips you put on a tie and who here, whoever wears a tie, you know, you tie your tie right. And also you get that cool dimple and you look like you're amazing. Like that's like, yeah, you had to do double wins or you get the tie and just like pops and makes it cool. So this dimple clip, even if you tie a horrible knot, you throw a thing on and boom, that fast, you've got a dimple and you look amazing. Right. And so I saw something that's pretty cool. But I was like, but I don't know if I want to pay 20 grand to invest in this idea that I don't even know if it's a good idea or a bad idea. So I went to the site to go see like, if there's actually selling what it looks like. So I went to the site, dimpleclips and the very top, there's a little button that said wholesale. I was like, Oh my gosh, I can buy this stuff wholesale. I don't have to pay him 20 grand to buy the entire company. I could just buy the things wholesale. So I clicked on the wholesale thing and sure enough for $399, I was able to get 1500 dimple clips that I can then take. So total investment is business. I'm in 400 bucks. I buy the dimple clips. We give ship to our office. My entire team's like, why in the world did you buy 1500 dimple clips? I was like, cause someday I want to sell ties. And I know that people who buy dimple clips, guess what they want to buy? Ties, right? So now we're in business. Uh, we go in really quickly. We set up a site called flossenties.com. I said, we're going to give away, um, the dimple clips on the front for free plus shipping after someone gets that, then we're going to upsell some ties. I called Bart Miller cause Bart's the one who dresses me for funnel hacking lives. Like, dude, Bart, do you know how to sell his ties? And Bart's like, yeah, I know lots of people sell ties. I'm like, cool. Can you ship me six ties? And he's like, yeah, so then he ships me six ties and then we put that as the upsell and guess what? And like, I don't know, eight hours. We're in business. We are in the dimple clip business. We are selling, uh, these things and now we're driving ads to it. People are coming. They're buying the dimple clips. We order form, bump them a whole big old pack of dimple clips and then the upsell number one are these ties. Now these ties, are they awesome? I don't know. I have no idea. I don't know if they're going to sell or not. The good news is I only have one of each. So I'm just testing the market right now to see people want them. If people say, yes, these ties, I'm like, Hey Bart, give me 2000 more of that tie cause everyone's buying that. And we sold a whole bunch of them. If nobody buys them, then I'll try to find some more ties or do something else. Or we'll just shut this thing down cause I've been 400 bucks at this point and a couple hours of work. Okay. Virtual real estate. After we get the thing finished, we're going to go get a Facebook ad agency. We're going to plug it in and this thing, we're not autopilot and I'm in the tie business. How many here people here actually run a Facebook ad agency? Raise your hands. Careful to look around. These are the people you can partner with. These are your property managers. You just finish the funnel. You hand it to them and then they're done. Okay. There's a lot of Facebook ad agencies inside of our community here. Right. We hand it off. We plug it in and boom, we're in business and this thing, I don't know what's going to do yet. We just got this done last week. Um, my team's like, we're literally in the middle of fun hiking live and you want to launch a tie company. I'm like, yes, of course I do. Um, so we launched this thing and, um, again, I don't know what's going to make it. It might be 500 bucks a month. It might be nothing. Might be 10,000 bucks a month and maybe this one hits and we're like, oh my gosh, we're in the tie business. Let's go deep. We made build a huge company off of it, but probably not, but maybe. Right. This we have to understand so many of you guys are sitting back and you're waiting. You're waiting for your click funnels. You're like, okay, someday I'm going to get the idea. It's going to be amazing. And you're right. Creating these courses, these buttons, insane stuff and you're waiting and you're waiting and you're waiting. It's like, we got to get you in the game. Like this pay 400 bucks is getting the game and start playing this game because you're going to learn so much stuff. Even this fails. What did I learn? I learned like how to find an offer, how to find some products, how to create an upsell on the down side. You're learned how to use click funnels, how to drag and drop things. I learned how to connect a shopping cart to the actual funnel. And when someone buys it, how to ship them out the product. I learned all these things with the $400 investment. It's not that scary, but now I can see if it's going to work. Okay. Again, I told people before, like click funnels was my 150th funnel that we launched. Okay. If I would have waited for this to be the very first funnel, I would have launched. I'd never been worthy to find this. That makes sense because I tried the first thing and the next thing and the next thing is I did that as I was in momentum, moving forward, new opportunities came to me better. I just came to be different things came to me. Okay. And so for a lot of you guys, this is some of the stuff you can start thinking about, just have some fun, just to practice. Okay. I told him my potato gun story all the time because that was just something for me to try out and to test. If it failed, it wasn't like I was a failure. Like it turns out no one wants potato guns, turns out no one wants dimple clips, but what if they do? I don't know. Okay. There's one example. All right. Let's show you another example. This one goes into licensing here. Has ever heard of licensing before. Okay. Licensing is where somebody else did all the hard work and then you pay them to build that just have it all for free or for really, really cheap. I wanted to build a chicken coop product because somebody told me that they made a bunch of money with chicken coops. Um, I was like, are you serious? Like that's amazing. So I bought chickencoopsecrets.com. But I was like, but I don't know anything about chickencoops. Um, my wife keeps trying to get me to like buy chickens and I'm like, I don't want chickens and she's like, but we can have our own eggs. I'm like, I don't want chickens. And, um, she's like, but eggs get really, really expensive. And I'm like, but I don't want to know chickens. That creeps me out. So I don't know anything about chickens. So I'm like, I don't know how to create this product, but maybe someone else has already created a product on chicken coops. And so I went to clickbank.com and in click bank, there's a marketplace of like hundreds of thousands of funnels. And, uh, it's cool thing is click bank. Um, the marketplace like shows you based on what's selling the best. So this is the secret. Um, the first page, those guys are making tons of money. Do not contact them. The second page, third page, fourth page. You get to like the 40th page. Those of you who are making no money right now, yet they did all the work. They created the product, wrote the sales, I'd have the upsells, how the downsides, but the product doesn't sell anymore. So I went to click bank. I typed in chicken coops in the thing and a whole bunch of things popped up. Whole bunch of different offers. And so I went to every single one of them and I messaged every single chicken coop site and I literally said, Hey, um, can I license your chicken coop, uh, product? And, uh, this dude, Johnny Wang rolled back and Johnny said, Hey, what's your proposal? I was like, sweet man, um, I'll give you a thousand bucks licensed your product and the sales copy. He said, sounds good. What's the timing? I said, uh, it's in perpetuity and, uh, we signed a contract and that fast. I got the entire product for a thousand bucks. I'm in business selling chicken coop plans. Um, and that's licensing. Okay. Now what I do, I grab that, throw up a Facebook ad agency, step back and who knows? I don't know if it's going to make a hundred bucks a month, 500 bucks a month. I'm in business. I test that whole process. Okay. Click bank literally is a graveyard, hundreds of thousands of dead funnels, hundreds of thousands of them. In every topic you can dream of. Okay. This is not the first time you had to licensing. Click bank, we go there all the time. I try to find something. If sometimes I need a bonus or upsell or something, I'm like, ah, maybe someone already created it. I go to click bank. Oh, on page 46, some dude created something already does that message and hate and a license your product and usually somewhere between 500 to a couple thousand bucks, depending on how good it is, a license, the product that sells letter of the everything and boom, I'm in business. Throw it into a funnel, chicken coop secrets. Let's go. All right. Plugging a Facebook ad agency and now I'm in business. Okay. You guys getting this? Is this fun? Good. Fix and flips. Um, this is one, I almost feel bad about this story, but, uh, so a lot of people ask me, where do you get all these things coming to you? Sometimes I'm finding them. Sometimes they're just as you're in motion, doing things, more deals and offers will come to you. So, uh, I had a buddy, we both wrestled the BYU together and we were in the same way class. So we kind of hate each other cause like we had to always compete against each other, but he's really cool. And, um, anyway, we graduated a couple of years later. I was having some success in business. He had his own business as well. And one day I don't know if something happened and he got in trouble and he messes with me, he's like, Hey man, I need 20 grand. And I was like, dude, we used to fight every single day. You're awesome. I'm not ready to check for 20 grand. He's like, no, I really need $20,000. This is an emergency. I know you got it. Can I have 20 grand? I'm like, no, like, no. And then, uh, finally, he's like, well, I have this website. It's called by gone. And he's like, right now it makes, um, it makes about $2 or $3,000 a month. If you give me the 20 grand, um, I'll give you the cash flow from the website for the next 10 months until it was paid off. And I was like, no, he's like, why not? I'm like, cause dude, I 20 grand in my pocket today is worth more 20 grand over time. I'm like, but I will buy the website and the company from me for $20,000. And, uh, he was like, but dude, this is like my livelihood. I'm like, yeah, but this is my 20 grand. And so eventually went back and forth and he said, yes, so I gave him the $20,000. He gave me Viagon. We put it in the site and it started making, um, started making money. And all it was, if you look at the site initially, actually, it was, uh, two YouTube videos that drove traffic to it and that was the site. That's why I was like, there's no way to make money. Like, um, it was, so we went back, we tweaked the site, got in, click phones, may look really nice. And then I'm like, what other tools do we have? Um, about that time is when Jamie Cross, um, spoke at funnel hacking live in Nashville, how many of you remember when Jamie spoke? And she did this presentation called the five minute perfect webinar, which took my 90 minute webinar. She shrunk it down to five minutes for e-commerce sellers. And I was like, sweet. So I literally took that piece of paper. If you guys remember this, Jamie spoke about it. Jim Edwards created one page piece of paper that you would fill in, you fill in the paper and it would take your product and plug it into a perfect webinar, five minute, perfect webinar. We took that, we did the, in funnel scripts, there's a digital version. So I filled out the form and funnel scripts that clicked a button, boom, it popped out the five minute perfect webinar for Viagon. We hired two actors. I had each of them read the thing while we filmed them, telling their stories. Um, within the day, we had two five minute perfect webinars to sell Viagon. We gave them to the ads agency. We set it up and boom, now Viagon is back on and it's selling, uh, people, these cold stores, zappers, right? It's up there. And now we have a face by ad agency plugging it in and driving sales 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Buy and hold. Now this is what I'm really excited for. In fact, how many guys became it today? You saw in your seat, a little packet of something called zoom a juice. Okay. So zoom a juice. I talked about this earlier today. So zoom a juice is actually one of my friends' companies and he launched this company and, um, I remember watching him and he was so passionate about it. He's having so much fun with it and he's an amazing, um, copywriter and marketer and everything. And I remember just watching his journey. And after he launched this, this, uh, this green drink, um, one of my favorite things was the actual sales video. And so it's interesting. I contacted him later. I was like, do that video was so good. I'm like, who did it? Like, did you hire the Harmon brothers or something? He's like, he's like, no, here's who I hired. He's like, but I wrote the scripts and we hired the actors and everything. And I said, how much the whole thing cost you? Cause I knew what we had paid the Harmon brothers to videos like this for us. And I don't remember exactly, we said it was, it was multiple six figures he spent to create this, uh, the sales video. I'm going to show it to you guys. Cause this is the reason why I bought ended buying this business. So this is the sales video. Um, I'll click play real quick and you have a chance to see, um, why this business, um, was so powerful and why I wanted to get it. You already know you should be eating more fruits and veggies. Your doctor tells you your mom tells you even the governance. One way to get more of the good stuff is green juice. You like yours. Chunky. I like mine a little chunky. But to get even one sip of that coffee produce, you have to pass through the three levels of health net health shopping, shopping and juicing. What about, I don't even want to think about cleaning. Shopping for fresh fruits and vegetables in the pain. You spend all day cruising the produce aisle, emptying your wallet, just to try to fill your basket. When you get home, you still have to chop it. All of it. Is this your kitchen or level six? It's a fruit new job. After all of that shopping, chopping, juicing and cleaning your reward is a small glass of sludge. Look, I'm crazy about my health, but I'm not that crazy. The folks at Zuma Juice had this wild idea that people, you might like green juice if it was simple, convenient and didn't taste like a cow's burp. So while each glass of Zuma Juice is packed with six different greens and grasses, three organic sprout concentrates, seven organic vegetables and 13 fruit, superfoods and herbs, it also tastes really good. And no shopping or chopping required. Just add cold water, shake it up and you have an energy packed immune system boost in green juice that you can take with you anywhere. You mean like this? Yes. There are other powdered green drinks on the market, but most of them taste like something that you scraped out of a lawn mower. Wow. A really expensive lawn mower. Or worse, they have that really nasty synthetic vitamin aftertaste from, well, from the nasty synthetic vitamins they add to them. Zuma Juice has a refreshing natural mint flavor with just a hint of vanilla. And unlike those calorie dense juices you get from your juicer, Zuma Juice only has 30 calories per serving, which makes it a perfect drink for in between meals. I drink this every day. Now, I don't want to sound like your mom, but you really should be getting more fruits and veggies in every day, don't you think? If you want a tasty way to be healthy, feel fantastic and get energized. Order your Zuma Juice now. It costs a lot less than juice or even those fancy coffee drinks. It travels easy. Kids love it. And best of all, you'll actually want to drink it. Try Zuma Juice, the delicious green juice with all of the green goodness and none of the yuck. If you guys ever heard the term a Rembrandt in the Attic. So what that means is basically, imagine there's two people going to go purchase a house. They walk through the house like, ah, it's a nice house. It's probably worth $250,000. And everyone goes through the house, but then one person goes through the house and they're looking through and they go up in the attic and they open up. And also they see an original Rembrandt. And they're like, oh my gosh, I know the value of that painting. That painting is worth millions and millions of dollars. And so they come back out and like, okay, I'll give you $4 million for this house. I'll give you $2 million. Right. And then a person's like, this one worth $250,000. But for the other person, because they know the value of the house, they know there's a Rembrandt in the attic, they don't want to spend way more. Right. For me, when I started doing more of this investing stuff, I'm looking for a Rembrandt in the attic. For me, when I saw this funnel, I was like, that video is the Rembrandt in the attic. Like that video is so valuable. Like I know how good it is. Okay. I loved it so much. I started using the product, but then I went to funnel hack it during a funnel, funnel you issue number 18. I went to funnel hack it. I bought the product, went to the next page and there was no upsell. There was no down. So there was an order form bump. There was all these things that were missing. And I was like, the guy's name is Luke. I was like, Luke, why do you hate money so bad? Like you're not doing any of the things you need to do to like blow up this business. And over time, the business ran for a couple of years. And then, um, I don't know all the details, but I know there was a fight in the partnership or something happened and they'd have shut it in the site down and it was down for a year or two. And I remember, I always remember that video. I'm like, man, that video is so good. Like that alone was worth so much money. And so I started messaging Luke. I was like, Hey man, can I buy, um, can I buy zoom with juice? He's like, why would you want to buy it? It's dead. I'm like, cause that video is so good. And, uh, we went back and forth for years, like literally a year after you get messaging, like no, no, no. And finally when COVID hit, uh, one day I was bored and I was like, Luke, dude, do you want free money? Like literally just sitting there on your hard drive somewhere. I will give you money. You can split it with your partners, whoever had it and it'll be awesome. And, uh, eventually for about one fifth, what they spent on the actual sales video, I was able to acquire zoom and juice. And now what's cool about that is then what's the next step. We talked about this earlier today. I have this asset. It's amazing. The next thing I do is I got to figure out what is the control today. I haven't run a supplement funnel in seven years. I said, what's the control? Right. We talked about this earlier today. What is the control? I got to figure out how does supplement funnels work nowadays? So I went through, we were started funnel hacking a whole bunch of supplement funnels from that we figured out, this is the, this is the control. This is what all successful supplement funnels are doing today. I said, okay, now that we know that we need to create a couple of things. Right. We knew this is what the sales page looks like the order form bump with the price point is we're upsell number one upsell to the downsides. We knew all the things we needed to create. So because that we needed to recreate the product, the product had been sold for four or five years. We got the product recreated. And some of you guys got that one. The green, if you had the green zoom of juice, that's the green drink. But then the upsell path, I mean, we need upsell. So someone just drank their fruit, their vegetables. Next thing they need is their fruit. So if you have the red pack, that's large zoom of juice fruits. And so the upsell is our, is the fruits. And so went through, we took this control and then we built out every single step in the process. Let me go back. Um, so sales video took the sales letter order form, uh, upsell down. So again, we just took the control of what's working. We modeled for, for zoom of juice, put it in there. And, uh, this is actually, we literally, the, the package you guys got today is the first set of the packets. We just got back. So this has not gone officially live yet. Um, I do believe if you guys want some, there's a postcard with a link. You guys can go and buy it. And if you do buy it, we'll send you guys, um, the share funnel to this, to the supplement funnel. So you guys can have that and you can use it inside your click phones account as well. But again, we got this all done. We did the hard work, got it finished. And now we're going to step back. We're going to plug in a Facebook ad agency and then we'll just run itself. Virtual estate. And this one I have a lot of hopes for, I think this one's going to do really well. Um, but again, I invested this money up front and, um, it's a little bit bigger project, but so much fun. So exciting. Um, because I look, I was looking for that thing. Like I knew that that sells video was something I could turn into something bigger, right? When you guys start looking at these sites, start looking for opportunities, there's going to be things like maybe you're really good at in webinars. You see something like, Oh, if I just plugged the webinar into this business, I could blow it up or maybe, Oh, I need a challenge from a plug, a challenge. And I'll like the copy was horrible. I'm going to copy right. If I just the copy here, I could, I can make it better. Or maybe it's the designer. Maybe it's the flow, but you're just looking for like, what are the skillsets you guys have? Right. Do you know how to add tile, how to add paint, how to do something like that? If you can figure out these skillsets we're teaching you, you can go to any of these businesses and start plugging things in and get things working really quickly. And so much fun. Can I think I have one more or maybe two more? I'm going to show you guys the next one is a company called Audban broth. And this one's not live yet, but how many of you have ever seen me drink bone broth? In fact, here's a picture of me drinking my bag of bone broth. Okay. If you follow me on Instagram, I met this lady who was, she's written like five or six books on bone broth and I was at a mastermind meeting with her and she was like bouncing off walls. She was so excited about everything and she's a doctor. She's, I'm a doctor. She's like, no matter what somebody comes when they come to me, the only thing I prescribe them is bone broth. I don't care what it is. I get bone broth. Like what? And she's like, yeah, here's everything fixes everything. Two, but two cups of bone broth today will change your entire life. And I was like, are you sure? Because that seems really weird. And she's like, no, I swear, but she's a doctor. So we believe doctors, right? So I was like, all right, well, if you're, if you're that excited and she's like, she's like me 10 years ago, I was tired. I was depressed. I had all these problems. She's like, I started drinking bone broth and changed myself as well. And so I got excited. I went to go buy bone broth and I bought a bag of bone broth and I drank it and it was disgusting. I was like, oh my gosh, this is not worth any amount of health. And I tried another one and another one. And eventually I found this company, all bone broth. I started ordering. I drank the first one. I was like, oh, this actually tastes good. And I was so excited. And so I used to buy this frozen bone broth. My poor wife, I'd fill our whole freezer full of thousands of these bags. And every morning I thought I went out and I drink it on Instagram and everyone's like, you're literally just drinking bone, like bone broth out of a bag. I'm like, oh yeah, that's not as much energy. That's why I'm so excited. So I look like I'm 12 years old. I'm actually 60, but this bone broth has made me so young. Anyway, literally obsessed with this stuff. You can ask anybody. My whole office is like, you're so weird, Russell. Like nobody else drinks bone broth out of a bag. And then in the middle of Corona, I tried to order some more and guess what? It was gone. They're out of business. I was like, dude, need some bone broth. Like you can't. I'm like, you don't understand. Like I'm addicted. Give me some bone broth. Like people, it's like untangled when the old lady, when she doesn't sing the song, she starts getting all like, I'd be out here in front of hockey live like 90 year old. And he was like, what happened to Russell? I'm like the bone broth. Give it to him. So anyway, I get messaging, trying to get a hold of the company, finally get a hold of the owners and said, hey, COVID here, we had some problems and supply chain management. And we had to like shut the company down. I was like, oh my gosh, like, dude, like I love your guys product. And like we love it too. But unfortunately, like this is kind of where we're at. I was like, okay, this is the deal. Um, we need to bring this back. What's it going to take? And he's like, well, um, you know, we're out of money. We're out of stuff. Like, like we need to like, we need to order to get all sorts of stuff. I said, okay, how about this? I'll be your business partner. I'll finance the whole thing. We'll get it back up and running. And then we're back in business. Um, and like, seriously, it's been negotiated back and forth. And, um, uh, they ended up giving me, uh, the majority, um, uh, a big majority of the company. So I'm the majority owner of the company now for free. Didn't cost me a penny other than I was in charge of getting, uh, the production back online and then building out the funnel and then launching it. And so it didn't cost me any money outside of the hard costs to get the business back up and running. And then the next step was like, Hey, now I'm selling bone broth again. What do I need? What's the control? How do we sell bone broth? So we went and funnel hacked every single bone broth, every single similar funnel we could find. We figured out here's the control, what's going to work. And then we started going through and building out the actual funnel. Um, the funnel is almost done. I'm hoping in, uh, right now in the production of actually making on the bone broth and things like that. And we're hoping about two months now it'll be done and will be launched and live. And then guess what I'm going to do? I'm going to step away from it. I'm going to plug into Facebook ad agency and boom, bone broth will be paying me for the rest of my life. And that is how much fun these things can be. Yes. Get in this. Okay. I got one more. And this is one for those of you guys who are like, this is all really fun and exciting Russell, but I have my core company. I'm trying to focus, which is good. We all should be focusing. This is like my limit, unfocus you for a few minute presentation. I apologize, but I know how you all are. You're like me. You like the shiny objects. So these are some shiny objects. Um, so this is one for those of you guys who are trying to focus. This ties back to a lot. What Kailin talked about earlier today. Right. You can also do this with your core company to figure out different ways to bring more people in. Okay. So virtual state to grow your company. So a little while ago, we were doing for our two comic club X members. We were doing an event in Boise. This is probably two months ago talking about physical products and things like that. And I showed this case study at Perry Belcher. Um, how many of you know Perry Belcher? Perry is awesome. One of my favorite people. And he has a site. I think it's CEO hats.com or free CEO hats or something. And on the site, he sells CEO hats. His hat says CEO on it. And that's it. And I remember seeing it. I was like, that's weird. So I bought it and there was no thank you. There was no like, there's no funnel or anything. And I was like, like, like Perry's a genius. There's something behind this week. What are you doing? So I call him. I'm like, dude, I buy your CEO hat. But like, how are you making money in this deal? Because literally there's no order form bumps or upsells or downsells or anything. And he said, Russell, guess who buys CEO hats? Like who? It's like CEOs. Like, Oh, he's like, this attracts all the best CEOs to me. And my goal is not to make money really quick and a funnel. My goal is to get a list of CEOs and I sell them seminars and coaching and masterminds. I was like, Oh, Perry, you're so smart. So smart. So I was showing this at our little two comic club event, two comic club X members. And as I'm on stage sharing this case study, I was like, dude, I should make some entrepreneur stuff and sell it to an entrepreneur. And I have click funnel stuff. But my guess is if you buy a click funnel shirt, you probably already have click funnels. Am I right? So I was like, crap, like I need shirts that aren't click funnels, but one step further out, like outside the market, which are entrepreneurs. And also I was like, wait a minute, I remember I bought this entrepreneur shirt back in the day from the site. I'm like, what the site was like startupdrugs.com. And I was like, Oh my gosh, I went to startupdrugs.com went to site and guess what? It was gone. I was like, what? And so I went back to the way back machine, which is this, if you go to archive.org, there's a thing called the way back machine. You put it in a URL and it shows you all the snapshots of that website from the beginning of time till now. So I went back in time to I found someone with contact information and I realized Maxwell Flynn, Finn, who's one of our two comic club winners, was the old owner of the site. So I messaged him on Instagram. My dude, you own the site. Kind of buy it from you. He's like, I can't. I sold somebody else. I'm like, who'd you sell to? So I told me the guy sold to, I call that guy up. Kind of buy the site from you. There's over a hundred different entrepreneurs, a t-shirt designs that were done that are amazing. And I was like, can I buy it from you? And he's like, sure. He's like, I set it up like six months ago and I think I forgot to pay the hosting bill because I just went to site and it's down. I'm like, oh yeah, sweet. Can I buy it from you? And really quickly we acquired the site. It's not officially live all the way right now, but we purchased this with the goal of now we relaunching these t-shirts. I have over a hundred different entrepreneur t-shirt designs. I'm going to be selling and guess what happens? An entrepreneur is going to see the shirt.
