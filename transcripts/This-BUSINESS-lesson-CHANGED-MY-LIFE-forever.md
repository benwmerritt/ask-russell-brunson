So this is me at age 10 doing my best to try to clean this car so I could get out and go play with my friends. What I'm doing right now makes me a little bit crazy but I'm about to realize the number one business principle in my entire life. Like many life lessons it all started with my dad. What on earth are you doing son? Hey my name is Russell Brunson and I grew up in a small town in Utah with a mom and a dad who were really amazing and I also had two older sisters and two younger brothers and that was me smack dad right in the middle. You know I grew up in a family where everyone had to work hard for what we wanted and we saw it from my parents and then it also led down to us and every single day we had to work hard at school, we worked hard at sports we were involved with and then on weekends we worked hard at home making sure that everything was clean and ready for the week. Dad just finished can I go? I want to play street hockey with the guys on the street. I don't know. Are you proud of it? I'm done. I didn't ask if you were done. I asked if you were proud of it. If you're proud of it you're done. Let me just check real quick I'll come and get you later. So this was my first introduction to the question that I'd end up living the rest of my life by. The question is are you proud of it? You know I think my dad believes that if you're putting things out there into the world and you're not proud of it then what does that say about you? What does that say about how passionate you actually are about what you're doing? Well? I'm proud of it. It's easy to be swayed to take the easy way out especially when you don't see the benefits of what's the end result you're looking for. In middle school I was on the wrestling team and they'd have us go run with the varsity guys over in high school. Oh. You wrestle over at the middle school shrimpy? Yeah. They'll have to be brutal for slow folks like us. Don't worry though. I know a shortcut. So at first I would kind of go cut these corners with them. I remember always feeling just not good about it. I think that was the second time in my life I really understood the whole concept of are you proud of it? You want to be here all day? Just cut the corners. I'm good. Suit yourself. Later in our wrestling match I saw the toll that cutting those corners had. He was doing fine at the start of the match but about halfway through he just got tired and was completely out of shape and he ended up falling hard. Now I never cut another corner again after that moment. It just came back to the exact same thing and this principle would serve me well into my adulthood. What's the word when you're trying to achieve something but it's like the end result of something you want to accomplish? What is that? A goal? Yes. Thank you. Honey why don't you take a break? I can't. I mean my editor has been hounding me for this book for months and it's just not right yet. I mean something feels wrong. So I've got to keep working on it. I think it's good. Mmm good? Uh-uh. Good is the enemy of great. People deserve my best. I'd gone about 200 pages into my new book called Expert Secrets but the foundation wasn't right and no amount of adjusting or wording or adding a sentence here or there was going to fix that. No dad, I'm not proud of it. I knew that I keep fiddling with it if I didn't do something drastic so I did something brave and possibly a little bit stupid. Hey guys, so I know a lot of you were looking forward to my new book. Here it is. But guys, this is just not it and you deserve my best. So I promise you guys, hey, I know I'm seeing the comments and I promise you guys it's going to be my best work. But this, this was just not it. Okay. I spent the next eight months researching and writing the next edition of the book and you know what? It was something I could be proud of. It's funny how all the things your parents say to you when your kid can stick with you. But whether it's at work or with your family, I always ask myself and my kids, are you proud of it? When you do your absolute best, there's an amount of satisfaction you get that can never come from taking it easy way out. Thank you.
