Welcome back to the magnetic marketing saga. How do you change the attractive character? I think any kind of internet business needs to know and to understand is how to create and develop your own attractive character. How is this going to work? Can we bring somebody else in? Is the community going to like them or are they going to connect with them? It's going to be the scariest and the most important for us to open those things up and share with people because when they see that, that's what's going to get them to be interesting enough to follow you. People don't connect today with brands. They connect with people. You're listening to Marketing Secrets with your host Russell Brunson. Hey, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome back today. We're talking about the magnetic marketing challenge. And this is important because obviously we've done a lot of challenges and click funnels and marketing secrets and all our different businesses. But this one was different because one of the major goals of this challenge was to actually change the attractive character. And that's what I'm talking about today because when you hear the concept of attractive character, right? I talk about it in all three of my books. Dot com secrets, expert secrets, traffic secrets. I always talk about having an attractive character and a pushback. I give me a sec. I see it. I see the DMs. I see the messages. See the posts online. It's like, I don't want to be attractive character. It's like I never sell my business, right? That's what people always say. So a lot of times they don't become the attractive character and their business never gets the spot where it can be sellable anyway, especially in today's world. Like having an attractive character is one of the most important things that people don't connect today with brands. They connect with people. You ask my kids, like, what's the biggest drink in the world? Like, I don't know. And then Mike, who's the biggest YouTube in the world? Like Logan Paul, Mike, what's his drink? Prime. Like they know instantly, right? Because they don't connect with prime. Growing sports drink in history. That's the thing people understand. So having attractive characters is essential to be able to grow, to be able to connect people to like traffic ads, connections, selling all stuff is based on a character. So as you guys know, Dan Kennedy is the attractive character in that business. And it's interesting because when Dan sold the company, sold it to Bill Glazer and then Bill Glazer co-branded it together. So it was Dan and Bill. In fact, he even changed the name from, I think it was Kennedy Inner Circle at the time. He changed it to Glazer Kennedy Inner Circle. It became GKIC for all the old school people. We remember it was GKIC for a decade after Bill sold it to another company. They actually, it was interesting. They actually tried to get rid of the attractive character. Like what? We don't need Dan. We have all the training. They tried like almost snuff Dan out, which is weird. You cover the attractive character and sells one down the company. The point where eventually I was able to buy it. Now, when I bought it for me, obviously Dan is still the attractive character, but Dan also isn't going to do what I do as an attractive character, right? I'm on Facebook lives and podcasts and interviews and I'm traveling the world. I'm speaking to events like the lot of things I do that I'm not going to get Dan Kennedy to do as much as I wanted to try to put in his contract. He would not do TikTok ads. Like he just refused. I don't know why he did in the contract was willing to write a weekly fact. So we got those coming in almost to this TikTok ad, but he wasn't willing to do some things. Right. So initially when I bought the company, I kind of co-branded me and Dan, right? Because we need somebody to be out in front. And so the first year of me owning my day of marketing, you'll notice that I was on the sales videos. And as I was doing it, the role I was taking was not of like a co-branding. I was looking at myself as I was the reporter. Let me tell you about Dan Kennedy. I'm the reporter. There's this guy. He's my mentor. He's my hero is Dan Kennedy, which he is, right? So I was reporting on him, bringing back the best stuff. Here's what I learned from Dan. Here's what Dan's doing. I brought him to Funnel Hiking Live and I interviewed him. I let him be the star of the show. And for a year, I did that, right? So that way everyone in my world and ClickFunnels audience now became very familiar with Dan. They fell in love with him. You know, we've got five or 6,000 people now on his newsletter. Like that first phase worked. But after a year into this business, I'm like, I can't keep being the attractive character for ClickFunnels. And then like a kind of a partial track to character for magnetic marketing. Like we need somebody who can, who can take that role, who can be the front of it, who can be running the events, who can be doing the mastermind groups, who can like, who can do all those things, right? When I had my day with Dan Kennedy, when I had a chance to fly out to Cleveland and spend time with him, it is at home in the basement. That's when the question that I asked him was like, I'm being stretched thin amongst all the things I'm doing. And as I got eats somebody who you think represents the face of magnetic marketing, the best somebody who is a student who has done this. Ideally, someone who's done it both in the brick and mortar world, right? Because so much of magnetic marketing is was based off of brick and mortar companies, right? But also someone who's done it on the online and info product world. And I asked Dan, like, who is there somebody who you know could be that person? And it was cool because he wasn't like, well, here's five people you could pick from. I came back to me said, there's one. Like the person I would recommend is Marty Fort. I'd met Marty once. I'd seen him, but I didn't really know much of his story. I'm like, well, tell me a story. He said, well, Marty had a music school, like a brick and mortar physical location. People came and learned music from him, right? And when he learned about magnetic marketing, Dan Kennedy based marketing, he went and he blew up that school, applying magnetic marketing to physical, like actual stores. Then he said, you got so good at that. He said, I'm going to teach other music schools how to do the same thing. So he created information business and started teaching schools that my name is Marty Fort. I own a brick and mortar music schools. I also coach music school owners around the world. I've been involved with Dan Kennedy and magnetic marketing since 2008. I found him through one of his books, which I think many of us do. That's really the way in. Dan Kennedy has just been awesome. He's been an amazing mentor and teacher. And now the info business is, I think he said three times bigger than the other one. Here's the big thing. Everybody at home, please take this to heart. The coaching business makes more income than all three schools combined. He's like done both sides of it, right? He's a Dan Kennedy disciple like me who, who followed him and said that he'd be the person who could kind of become the front of this. I messaged Marty. I was like, would you be interested? And luckily he said, yeah, he was honored. He loved to do it. And so we started kind of putting the pieces together. It started with funnel hacking live. Me, Marty, uh, went to Dan Kennedy's hotel room and we spent time kind of talking about householding that work. The next level for everything in this business, we, we need somebody who can be more, uh, an active face of doing makes it like doing online challenges. It's an honor for me to be even in this discussion. So whatever you gentlemen need me for. And so that's kind of the game plan. Obviously we still have Dan is still the attractive character of the company. He's the core personality. It has his core teachings, trainings, frameworks, philosophy, everything that we're leveraging, but Marty, we want to transition to be the front. And so I thought the best way to start that is by doing a challenge. That way everybody in the community can be introduced to him, but at the same time we don't want to lose, we don't want to lose Dan in the, in the equation. Right. I've seen a lot of people who have, in fact, other people had bought Dan's company the past. I've seen other people who've tried to do this. They try to take the guru out of it. They try to take that person out and when they snuff out the voice that people are there to hear, that's when things collapse. The vision that has we were creating this is if you've ever been to Tony Robbins, UPW Tony used to teach for four days. The whole event was Tony teaching like four days and getting you in state. You're jumping around and you do a bunch of stuff. Eventually Tony's voice started going, yeah, started losing his voice. That's why you know, that's why Tony talks like this now. I got really excited and that made me more effective in business because he was doing so many events. His voice was having problems. Then Tony brought in someone named Joseph MacLinden. Anyone who's ever been UPW, you know, Joseph MacLinden. He's kind of the sub attractive character, right? And Joseph now runs the days of Tony's out there. Tony's there day one of three and then Joseph MacLinden teaches day two and four. But what's cool is that Joseph doesn't just get there and like now start teaching Josephisms for the next, you know, the entire day. He's there to talk about like how he's applied Tony's principles. Then they push it back and they show videos of Tony. Tony goes and teaches it, Joseph comes back out reinforces it and they keep doing that for the for the other two days. So like we could do something like that. That would be the magic because I'm sure yes, I could pay Dan. We could weave Dan into this challenge and be amazing. But like, I don't what's going to happen someday when Dan's done when he retires or whatever, right? We needed to figure out the model today so it could be sustainable over time. And so for the challenge, I made Marty the face of it. Marty was the face we talked about like when people opted in that it had Marty's you know, Marty Dan Kennedy's face on the registration page after people registered for the challenge, the on the thank you page. We had an upsell for for the No BS newsletter, right? For the MIFC and so we had Marty actually do the one who was actually pitching that right? He said, you know, I'm excited to be spending time with you guys over the next five days. I'm going to Dan Kennedy students. I love them. I'm going to be your lead trainer over the next five days. And so I just wanted to say hi. By the way, this is why you need newsletter. He was able to talk about what it's been his life, why it's so important and why they need to buy it, right? So we were able to use him as a tractor character there. Then when the challenge actually started, again, Dan was not part of the challenge. Instead, it was Marty teaching a principal or philosophy showing how to apply to his business and then we pushed it to video of Dan from the past. Dan teaching one of his run to get millionaire seminars or one of his half day events or one of his super conference or info summits teaching the principal we needed. And that's what we did for the five days back and forth and back and forth. Obviously, to me, I was a little nervous because it's it's different, right? Like, like, how is this going to work? We bring somebody else in as a community to like him or they can connect them is he going to be able to sell at the end of it? Right? Help me welcome your host to the stage, Marty Ford. All right. Marty sells people at his events, but he doesn't sell them the way that I like to sell. Right? Like he he'd never done a challenge before. So we had to go back and sit down and with him spend time. We have to like teaching him. Okay. Here's the challenge framework. I had to teach him the perfect webinar, right? It was perfect webinar script is basically that's what the challenge funnel is, right? So I teach him like, like how to structure the content for day one, two, three, four or five, then we get to the to the offer. How do you structure the pit, the stack and the clothes? And like, it's way to go through all that with him. And man, Marty's like a an amazing student. He was studying. He was learning. He was like writing and rewriting and pitching and practicing and like, it was just awesome. And so when we got down to it and the challenge actually happened, he went in there and did an amazing job. You're great. Welcome to the looms. Welcome to the slides. I was back there like, yeah, I'm not doing the stacks. What else is doing there? Killing it. You know, when I'll send down like, well, he had really matters in the days like do people buy on day four? If they did, it worked. They didn't then something was wrong in the way. So this was kind of for Marty. This was basically trial run to see if he could actually do it. Right. And what's cool is that you went through the whole process just from the registration page. If you register and on the thank you page, we had the myth. He offered it, pushed people into no BS newsletter. I think we had 600 people decided to newsletter, which was a huge win. Added 600 people to continuity before the challenge even started. There's always a big win, right? And then we did the challenge day one, day two, day three, and then day number four is where Marty had the first, his first chance. The first time ever doing the stack in the clothes, which again, if you've been in my world, you've stayed in perfect webinar. It's the secret. It's the most powerful thing I can teach about a closed sales to the masses is the stack in the clothes and he executed it flawlessly. And we saw the sales start flying in that day. Next night, the next day, he did kind of a repitch, which was great as well. And then we watched over the next 48 hours before we as we did the cart closed down sequence and sales kept coming in for the thousand dollar offer that we made at the end of it. And when all's said and done, uh, over a quarter of a million dollars, the sales were $250,000 we made from the pitch that Marty did, uh, during the challenge. And so it was fun. Now, obviously I could spend this podcast talking about challenge structure and format, but that's not the point of this, right? This was us saying, okay, we need to do, um, something to bring into the track to care. Someone who in five years now, 10 years now that the community can connect with, they can understand so many people, especially people in the past who bought Dan's company, they want to make it about them. Like, oh, look, I'm the owner. I'm person. And for me, it's like, I want Dan to be the superstar. Like, I, like this is not about me propping myself up. This is about propping Dan. And Marty is such a good job of like being willing to do that. Right. And so I wanted him because like the next five, 10 years, like he's kind of person who will continue to prop up Dan and he'll get all the significance he wants and needs, but he'll do that by propping up Dan and telling the story about Dan Kennedy and how he's changed his life and, uh, the philosophies and principles. I think that, um, especially after the first run, I'm excited. Uh, we have the next few things set up with Marty to keep going forward. But, uh, my goal and my hope, my dream is that he'll be the, the forward-facing attractive character of magnetic mark and moving forward for the next decade or more. As I'm moving forward and we have live stuff we're doing with Dan, we're filming each of these pieces, knowing that this may be a challenge in the future. This may be a webinar in the future. This might be a live event. You know, like, and so we're trying to capture as many of those things as possible with Dan while we've got him, uh, before he retires and does whatever he's going to do in his future. Uh, but the biggest, uh, success for me was like understanding how to put an attractive character. It takes the weight off of yourself. And so for you, I want you to think about the same thing. I am a big believer that you need an attractive character to launch your business. It's the thing that gets it off the ground. It's the connections, the, the, the relationship with you and the audience initially understanding like, Hey, if I want to sell this someday, I can't, it can't just be me. Right. I've seen people successfully do it where there's a man they're bringing a female face now it cuts the workload in half, right? Or they're bringing three women and three men and also they become one of many experts, but it initially still starts with one as the attractive character using that to get the business off the ground, get it into the stratosphere and then it starts thinking strategic. Okay. How do I start replacing myself in different places? You'll notice this happening in the click follows ecosystem over the next 24 months or so. Um, and this is all part of the long-term strategic, uh, place with it someday. If I decide I want to retire or go read a book or go write some more books or whatever I want to do, they won't affect the health of the actual business. And you do that by kind of thinking strategically about how to replace yourself as an attractive character moving forward. So hope this helps you guys as you're looking through. There's a big magnetic marketing update. Again, the company is thriving. It's having, I'm having so much fun with it. And the best part about this is I got a fax from Dan this weekend, uh, cause you know, like Dan's my hero. He's my mentor. He's like the person I first got into his business. I always wanted to impress him. I didn't want to come into his business to be the guy who was trying to like, you know, leverage him to get credibility or anything. I wanted to like to put him on a pedestal. And so at the end of the facts, his best Dan and they said, PS, it is a pleasure working with you. And I believe that we are doing good work. When I hear from president past members and clients who are our members is all positive, which never happened with any of the previous owners, even back to bill, uh, which is literally the greatest compliment I could have possibly gotten from Dan. So, uh, that said, we've got a lot of work to do with magnetic marketing, more cool things coming. We've got some cool new books coming out. Dan and I are co-authoring a book right now. Some really fun stuff. So I'm excited to share it all with you guys. Thank you guys so much for subscribing. If you're not a member of the No BS newsletter yet, uh, surprise, surprise.
