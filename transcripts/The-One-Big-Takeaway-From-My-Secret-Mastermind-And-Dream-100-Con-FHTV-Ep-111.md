## Transcript
Good morning everybody, this is Russell Brunson. Today I am streaming from a little cabin in the middle of nowhere. This last few days I've been on a top secret retreat with a whole bunch of amazing business owners and it's been cool, it's been interesting. Let's jump on a helicopter with this guy. Let's go baby. You flying it? Are you flying? How many do you own at this point? Helicopters? Yeah. I want a helicopter baby. I'm slacking. It's interesting what you learn about yourself because I know that I'm introverted by nature and I just assume that at this point in my life that I'm not. Especially that I'm a group of people that are in my same world and are like, ah this is going to be so much fun. I don't know, it was tough for me a lot of times. Introverted Russell kept popping out and knowing that about myself, I feel so awkward in some of these situations that don't make sense. So for any of you guys who feel that sometimes and understand, why do I feel awkward here? Why do I not feel comfortable? It still happens to me, even among my peer group where it's just tough sometimes. But we probably got through it and it makes some really good, some great relationships which is cool. Music We went fly fishing. And then we went hiking. We went shotguns. Music Yesterday we went to go fly fishing. It's funny we go down there and they get me all set up and the teacher and the head of the casting which that part is kind of cool. You know, I'm trying to figure it out. Music It was interesting because I'm noticing that there's this hook on the end of my pole and I'm throwing it in and pull out, throw it in and pull that, throw it out, pull it in and that goes over and over and over. I was looking at it and I was like, this is so much like business, right? Again, as you've heard me talk about the whole hook story offer framework which is like the foundation of everything we're teaching nowadays. It's like you have created an irresistible offer and then you've got to have a story that amplifies the value of that offer. And then you have to have a hook that stops somebody and grabs them, right? In our world of now everyone's so busy through social media, there's a million things happening every second. It's just like how do you grab someone and if our hook doesn't convince the fish that it's like a worm or a bug or whatever, they're not going to come and bite your line, right? I think a lot of times some of us are trying this business and you're putting out your first thing and nobody bites and you're like, oh, like, you know, the center of marketing doesn't work. It's like, no, your hook didn't work, right? Like you keep throwing hook in and after hook, after hook, after hook, like half of what I do in this business is I figure out hooks to like grab people. Every email I send to hook, every Facebook live to hook. I mean, it's like trying all these different hooks to see which things people respond to. And it's interesting because even me, like tons of my hooks fail. Tons of the different messages I put out there do not resonate with people. They don't do anything with them. It's really fascinating. And the good news is nobody knows when they fail because nobody sees them because nobody, we don't put much of advertising dollars behind it because the first hook didn't. Didn't catch any fish, right? It's the same thing for you. Like you got to cast out all these different messages and headlines and hooks and things until you until like you find something that like somebody grabs onto. Hey, Brandon, where are we going right now? We are jumping in helicopters and we're going to a lake secretly, a secret lake in Jackson Hole for some kayaking. So we're helicoptering in, kayaking around and then getting these guys on airplanes. This is an Illuminati meeting and he is the head of the Illuminati nose skin. I think it's Walker's. Who's the head of this organization? Anyway, they literally brought the helicopter directly to the place we're staying at. Come on! Alright, we're here. We have to jump on those kayaks right there and they're taking us in the river before we actually fly home in a few minutes. So that's what's happening. That was something I'm just thankful for my father giving me love of nature when I was young. So if your parents out there, get your kids outside. Alright, good morning morning. So I went to bed last night, sent all those images. We're doodling on my bed over here. Sent all these awesome things to Vlad and woke up this morning and guess what's done? Boom! Three types of traffic. Pretty awesome. So now I got all the presentations I need for the event today with Dana Derrick's. I'm giving a new presentation that I've never done before. That is actually the framework for the new Traffic Secrets book. I have a two hours time slot so for two hours I'm going to be teaching the framework for this, for my book. And I'm going to see what hits and what doesn't. So excited to trade out and hopefully resonate with people so we'll see. Alright, wish me luck. So I gotta put together my slides. Three more in under con, getting going! Yeah! Hey! Oh, thank you guys so much. I'm excited to be here. This is so much fun. I feel like I'm with a whole bunch of my family and friends. This event is called Dream 100 Cons. It's about Dream 100 which is like the foundation of Traffic Secrets. It's like this is a perfect audience and opportunity for me to small scale to test out my material. The third type of traffic and this is the best and the most important is traffic that you own. My entire goal of our business, everything we're doing from a traffic generation standpoint, is to convert traffic I control, traffic that I earn into traffic that I actually own. Because you own the traffic, that's the secret sauce, right? I'm going to feel like what works, what doesn't work. I'm going to cut things out, move things around, and then I'm going to start writing the book. But notice what I'm doing, right? I'm throwing hooks down the side of the thing, just throwing hook, hook, hook, trying to see what things people resonate with, what things people are gravitating towards. Jay Abram taught me this initially. He said, look, if you're trying to find joint venture partners with Dream 100, the first thing you have to figure out is like where does your product, your service fit in the timeline of your dream customer? And you've got to figure out what are all the services they need before they come to you and what are all the services they need after they come to you. So for you, I want you to think about that. Like if you're writing your webinar pitch, you're doing your thing, and you haven't been thrown out hooks, like you're just guessing, you're writing your first version of your book and you're getting it back and it may suck. It may be awesome, it may have landed the first time, but you've got to go out on the road and test your material. And you should be able to do it through all these different means, doing through podcast interviews, like test out your framework, right? Test out your concepts and see what lands, see what doesn't. And then the same thing on Facebook Live, you're on your own page, you're on other people's page, like you're just testing out material the whole time so you can find out what lands and what doesn't land. Hope helps guys, 10-Shark throwing some hooks. And I think if you do that, you're going to have a lot of fun. So, all right, I got a balance. I got to get everything packed up and get out of here so they don't leave me because if I miss the helicopter, fly me back to the airport and I'm screwed. So, all right, thanks everybody. Appreciate you all. Thanks for listening and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you.
