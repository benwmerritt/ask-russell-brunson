Hey, this is Russell, welcome back to the channel. Today I want to take you guys on a tour of something really, really cool and special to me. When I started my entrepreneurial journey, a lot of people they want cars, they want fancy airplanes, stuff like that. For me it was different, I wasn't into that. I wanted something that was going to help me, my body, help my family. I wanted my own gym, and not just a home gym. I didn't want a Peloton in the corner and a couple weights. I wanted a gym, and that is what I created, and that's what I'm going to show you guys here today. So come on in, let's check it out. Music Okay, I want to welcome you to my gym, and before we dive into all the cool stuff here, this is where all the magic happens. This is the wrestling room, this is the real reason I wanted it. I wanted a place for me and my kids to be able to wrestle, and this is kind of what it turned into. Whoever owned this initially obviously was their garage, it never became a garage for me. It's always been this, from day number one, Rob is in here painting, Matt's were showing up, the mirrors were showing up, and very secondly moved in because I knew that this was my wrestling room. It is about 2,500 square feet. I've been working out for the last five, almost six years now, and we're probably in it pretty close to about $150,000 or so, and it's honestly the best money I've ever spent. Music Every good gym starts with a good tire, because without a tire what's the point of you having a gym, right? The tire is good for lifting and flipping, we flip now the driveway and back, you can take the bigger sledgehammer, this is like chopping wood. Music So that's what the tire is for, and it's a lot of fun. Over here, this was totally an Instagram ad, I saw it, I was like freaking out, had to go to find my wallet. Come on, Instagram ads, like you can't say no to that. I even bought the upsells, but you'd expect that from me. Music I started wrestling when I was that age right here, I wrestled for two years, and apparently my parents said I hated it, but I got pitchers and a couple of medals, and there's my old single that I used to wear. It barely fit on my hand now, it's like a hand glove, but that's what I used to wear when I first started wrestling. These are my jujitsu, these are my medals, winning jujitsu tournaments, these are my wrestling stuff, the ones I'm most proud of are right here, this is when I want to stay title, and then this right here, so I took second place in the nation, and I was an All-American, so I moved my senior year, but the national tournament took seconds, this is basically as an All-American, so this for me is really, really special. HHS was my high school, Hillcrest High School, Elite was my freestyle McGregor club, then I wrestled BYU for a year, and then I wrestled Boise State, so those are my four teams I wrestled on. Music Most gyms you go to have a ton of like, the equipment that, you know, the chrome machine and the tricycle machine, all these kinds of things, but as an athlete, you want less machines, you want more free weights, and so we focus on more Olympic lifts, and so that's why we got the platform to your cleans, your squats, all kinds of stuff, and so like when I was wrestling at Boise State and BYU, there's no fancy machines you see in a gym, all we have is just like thousands of these, and this is how athletes work out. Olympic level, it's all Olympic lifts, and this is the thing that gives you the ability to do all that, so this is one of the most important pieces of the gym because it's how 90% of all of our weightlifting actually happens is on the racks. There's so many times in my life where I wanted to work out, but I'm like, I gotta jump in a car, and I gotta drive to the thing, and there's gonna be people there, and all the things, and there's just so many barriers that keep you from showing up. I mean, literally for me, it's a two minute walk from my back door here, and I'm two minute, 20 second walk from the back door, and there's still times in my head where I'm like, trying to, I don't wanna do it, don't go work out, and so I wanna get rid of as many distractions of things that keep me from actually doing it as possible. The other thing is like, I hate working out gyms, because everyone's like flexing in the mirrors, and like showing off to each other, and like, I don't wanna embarrass them, and I'm just joking. The reality is like, I always feel awkward in those things, like people are on the thing, and they're sweating all over the way, and you're just like, I wanna use that, but like, those kind of distractions, we're here, I can do whatever I want. Like, working out what I want, I can come at three in the morning, I can come at 10 in the afternoon, it doesn't matter, I can come here whatever I want, it's always open, it's always ready for me. To start coming over here, this is more like wrestling sports specific things, a lot of these. These are battle ropes that most gyms have these nowadays, which are really good for working out your shoulders, and your cardio, and things like that. Whew, anyway, so those are awesome. These right here, these are called gladiator walls. So most of the stuff, there's wrestling specific stuff invented by Yvonne Ivanov, who's one of my coaches, and so these are called gladiator walls, and there's a ton of things you can do with them. One of them is like this right here, this is a dip bar, you can hook a rope to and do ropes, you can do pull ups on it, you can put your feet up and do sit ups on it, there's like a million different things you can do, and it's nice because like, there's seven different stations, so for example, Dan wants to come and race me, so you can get on the ropes here. Okay, count me down, one. Okay, three, two, one. Go. Ah! Ah! Ah! One, two, three. Boom! So that's why I'm having four stations, because you can have two people competing against each other, so when you're a kid practice level winds up, and so you can go to like five or 10 or something, next comes, next comes, they can race on them, stuff like that, which is really fun. Next, and this is like my personal favorite thing, in the entire gym, is these rubber bands. This is the closest to wrestling, that I have an actual wrestling partner with you. Took rubber bands to you, you're here, so I get a stance, as I shoot, pulls me back, so I can practice my shots, my motion, all sorts of stuff. So there are throwing dummies, I'll show you a way you can throw and practice your throws, but if Von had the idea, he'd have to cut the dummy in half, and hook it to the bands, and then you can practice a lot of your throws from here. These are to place fit balls, which again, these are good for any kind of cardio, but especially for combat athletes. Parseans people first start doing this, they always slam it, and they pull it right, whoop, pull it into their face, every single time. All right, these right here, these are some of my other favorite things, these are called Bulgarian bags. People always ask me, what are those weird things hanging on your wall? So each color is different weight, so this is the lightest of the heaviest, we could have really strong people working out, young kids as well. Von, I have an off our coach, when he was in Bulgaria, when they would win a wrestling tournament, they would give people livestock. So he'd win a sheep, and he was carrying it home, he'd be like, I don't know, he could work out. So he started doing lunges with the sheep, he's like, this is a good workout. And then he started taking the sheep, and spinning around his head, and all sorts of crazy things. So when he moved to America, all his training equipment was just like gyms and stuff, and he's like, I need something more functional. And so he had his family back in Bulgaria, make these bags, he started using them as a training program for himself, and then for the Olympians. And now he's got a business that does a couple million dollars a year selling these bags around the world. Most combat gyms you go into nowadays, Jiu Jitsu, fighting MMA, wrestling, they all have Vons of bags. When I go on vacations, this is the only equipment I usually bring, I usually grab a bag and bring it with me, and that's what I usually work out when I'm on the road. My whole life, I was a wrestler growing up. So I wrestled, I was in gyms, I was working out, like that was my thing. And then when I got done wrestling, I kind of felt lost for a long time. That's when I transitioned to being an entrepreneur in business and trying to grow these things. And what's crazy, is that I made it, whatever that means as an entrepreneur, where I could afford a house and do those things. The very first thing I did was I built a wrestling room. I remember the very first day on this mat, one of my buddies came over and we wrestled, and it was so much fun. I remember we got done, I was like, that's all I really wanted. I just wanted to wrestle again. And I went through this huge loop of like, trying to start businesses and make money, all these kinds of things because I missed this. And so I just created this for myself so I can do this again. So when I was in high school, we didn't have something like this. And my dad wanted us to wrestle more often. And so he ended up buying two mats. It was like 10 foot by 10 foot. So it was just beginning to fit on our back deck in our backyard. And all winter long, we'd be snowing outside and we'd be outside wrestling on these mats. It was really fun. During the summertime, my dad would take the mats, he'd roll them up, he'd put them on top of our truck and we'd drive places with them. So I'd go to Bear Lake as a family trip. Every morning, he'd pull out the mats and we'd wrestle on the grass and we'd roll them back up and then go and go boating or go do whatever. And so when I built this room, I asked my dad if I could have them. And so we brought them. And so these are the yellow mats that I learned how to wrestle on every single day. And so they're special to me. And now there's kind of a thing that I have here. This is the one half of the mat. And this is the other half. Like I said, these things literally traveled with us around the country to wrestle everywhere. So we bought this house about five years ago. And as soon as we bought it, I knew this was gonna be a wrestling room. It was funny because they had a lawn mower or stuff they had in here. My wife's like, oh, we can have a store lawn mower in here. I'm like, no, this is my wrestling room. So before we closed on the house, I snuck back over here when they didn't know. And I snuck in here and I measured out the size of the thing. These pads right here that you lay out and then it's a tarp that goes on top of them. It's all custom fitted. So snuck in, I measured everything, figured out what it was that. Ordered the mats before we even closed on the house. I knew I wanted to just paint it. So I called my friend Rob's to Canaan's. I was like, we're supposed to move in this house in like two weeks. You wanna come and paint it? He was like, sure. So anyway, the day we closed on the house, Rob came and knocked on the door. And my wife's like, hey, there's some guy at the door for you, who's this? I'm like, oh, it's Rob. He's gonna be painting our garage for next week. And so he came out here and he was painting. Like a week later, the mats showed up and then the tarps. And then the mirrors show up and just all the things I kind of had project managed and got them all ready. That's how it kind of started. And then we've been building on it and changing it for the last five years, adding things, getting rid of things till we find exactly what we want. Because I don't want any waste of space here. It's just stuff that we're actually gonna use for myself, for my family, for the wrestling teams that we train in here and stuff like that.
