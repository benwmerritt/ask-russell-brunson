The Man, Russell! Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson. I'm here in our wrestling room right now with a bunch of my kids and cousins and friends. We've got a special guest in town in Boise today who I just got done wrestling, which was so much fun. I wanted my kids to get to know him and hear some of his stories and stuff for so many reasons. And so I love to kind of begin with if you want to talk about wrestling, and I'm going to be talking about wrestling, and I'm going to be talking about wrestling. I'm going to be talking about his stories and stuff for so many reasons. And so I love to kind of begin with if you want to tell them a little about your story. Yeah, great. It's a pretty open-ended when he says share your story. I got a long story. I'm 24 years old in 1996. My mom went in for a late ultrasound. They sat my parents down and said something's really wrong. And they said from the looks of it, it doesn't look like your baby's limbs are being developed. It looks like he's missing his legs, his arm, and his face might be messed up. Clearly, my face isn't messed up, right? And what they did was they classified me with what they call hand heart syndrome. And hand heart syndrome is a super rare genetic disorder that either leaves the babies with undeveloped limbs or undeveloped organs. And so that means the babies are either born with a heart that can't beat on its own or their stomach can't process food on its own and they later on pass away. And so they told my parents that their baby boy has about a 30% chance to live. And my parents made a massive promise. And that promise was that they were going to focus on their 30% chance of me living. I was born and the test of my organs came back 100% healthy and the only thing that was affected were my limbs. And so I was born in this unicorn body of no legs and one arm and all my organs are 100% healthy. And would you agree that there's always, in your life, there's always something bad that you can focus on? Would you agree? And would you agree that there's always something good that you can focus on? And so the majority of humans, and you can agree, the majority of adults, always focus on the negative stuff. And so we can train our brain to always focus on the good things that we always win. Music plays This is the accelerator and the brake. So you're going to, I usually push forward for acceleration and I pull back on brake. Everything was hard. You know when I was born, like everything was hard, right? And so I always tell people like if you, going into business or entrepreneurship, if you have a bad relationship with failure and rejection, this is the wrong thing for you. Because we're going to experience it all the time, right? And so, you know, failure is feedback. Like Don was saying, the faster you fail, you tweak and you come back and you figure out, what can you learn from it? The majority of people though, they ask the disempowering question, why did I fail? And why does this happen to me? Yeah, what's wrong with me, right? And like the way that our brain works is it's a problem solver. So if you ask a bad question, you're going to get a bad answer. And so I like to ask, even teach the kids this is like, what did I learn from this? And that way you take a winning lesson from it. And there's a quote by Nelson Mandela that I love. He says, in life I don't lose, I only win or learn. But it's our job to program our brain to win or learn. We don't just always win or learn, right? And this is, I think, well, tying to, I know what a lot of the conversation today is going to be about. So my junior year, I came in the season, I was like, I was going to be state champ. I was like, my goal, I was ready. And the very first match, I went against a kid who took second the year before. And I was like, okay, like this is my shot to prove that I'm as good as I think I am in my head, right? And I go out there and I wrestle him and I get beat pretty, pretty good. And it was just like devastating. And my good old dad is there with the video camera, films the whole thing. And I go home that night and I just, you know, just depressed. I want to go high and just super embarrassed. And so I go to bed that night and my dad jumps up, goes and, you know, puts the tape from the camera and things, starts watching the match over and over. Like, I don't think he slept the entire night. And next morning I woke up and getting ready for school. My dad's like, come here. Like, I know how to beat this guy. He pulls me on the carpet and he's like, show me the move and what he did. And I was just kind of annoyed at first, but he kept showing me. And he's like, this is how he did. And this is what he did and how his positioning was. And he had to learn from it. And it got better and better and better at learning how to do it. And I didn't wrestle the guy again the entire season, the Telastate tournament. We were, it was me against him. And my dad's like, all right, you've wrestled him every morning and every night for the last four months. Like we know how to beat him. And literally the move that he beat me with is the move that I beat him with. Cause I got so good at his moves, countering my dad by practicing with it and beating him with that. And when I learned from my dad that day, it was like, if you lose, that's not you lost. It's like, okay, we figured out what was wrong. Now we can make adjustments. Now we can make the tweaks and the changes and figure out how to win. And so it's funny cause in business now we're the same way. We launched a funnel and you can ask my team, like we launched it. I'm like, it's not going to work. Just get out there and we start driving traffic and look at the stats and we figure out all the tweaks and the changes to figure out how to make it, how to make it work. And that was like for wrestling, probably the biggest lesson I got was just that of like and then seeing what the problems were. And then that's where you start making the tweaks and the adjustments and the changes to get better and better and better over time. Yeah. Failing forward, adapting. Yeah. You always do that. Yeah. And just put yourself in there, put yourself in an environment to fail. Because if you're not there, you're not going to learn. You're not going to adapt. Yeah. It succeeds. I just want cause like one thing I think a lot of us people don't do is like we dabble and things are like, oh, we try this. I'm going to try this and try this. But when you decided that I'm going to be a bodybuilder, it wasn't just like dabbling, right? You shifted your environment, you shifted everything. We'll talk about kind of the process there and what you did to be successful. Yeah. What humans have, we all have it as shiny object syndrome. And so we try to do one thing and we're like, oh, maybe I want to try this over here. And so when I wanted to become a bodybuilder, I was living in New Jersey and it's very cold in New Jersey most of the time. And so I moved to Florida and I wanted to become a bodybuilder. And the first thing I did was found a really big muscle dude and I said, well, you teach me how to bodybuild. You look like you know what you're doing. I'm not going to be too light. I'm not going to be too light. Twenty. Twenty light. Thirty. Forty. And that's what we do in business, right? If we want to do something, we find out someone who's successful and we model them. And the reason being is because we don't have to reinvent the wheel. We don't have to recreate something. We just find someone who's successful and we learn from them. I became, well, I attempted to become a bodybuilder and when I moved to Florida, I told everyone over, over a million people that followed me that before 2017 was over, I was going to step or hop on the competitive bodybuilding stage before the year was over. And so I did a 12 week preparation and I dedicated 12 weeks of my life to training and health and fitness. I was 10 weeks into my prep and I went to Vegas for an expo. I go, I go in the gym and long behold there's Dwayne The Rock Johnson and he's surrounded by four security guards and he's working out. And I'm like, oh my God, it's the rock. After about 45 minutes of lifting, his security guard comes over and taps me on my shoulder and says, you're Nick, right? I said, not many people look like this. I'm Nick. And he goes, can Dwayne meet you? I was like, dude, bring him on. I've been waiting all this time. And so, you know, they bring me over into the corner and they bring the rock over and the rock gets on my level. Her tries his best to get on my level. And he goes, dude, I'm such a big fan. Can I have a picture with you? And on the outside, I'm like, sure, bro. But on the inside, I'm like, oh my God, it's Dwayne, Dwayne The Rock Johnson. Right? Fan girl. I blurted out all my goals to him. I said, I'm going to be the first Calvin Klein model with no legs. I'm going to write a book. I'm going to speak all over the world. He said, Nick, you're right. Because people like you and I, they put us in any industry and we adapt and overcome. After that, I went back to Florida and I competed in bodybuilding against full-bodied guys. And I took third. And I was like the first man with no legs, one arm to jump on a bodybuilding stage. And the quote that I used is over the 24 years of my life, I realized it's not the physical body that holds us back. But the biggest disability you can have, what do you think it is? Your mindset. Great job. You guys rock. Thanks for coming. Thanks for being with us and kids. All right, let's give Nick a huge round of applause. What's going on guys? I'm going to put this in speaking. It's basketball.
