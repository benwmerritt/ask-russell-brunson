What's up everybody this is Russell and welcome to Marketing Secrets while I'm in my car. So we went to iHop today. My daughter ordered the pancake with the fluffies and the sprinkles. There's sprinkles on it and bacon and egg right? Something like that. And then I go and I ordered scrambled eggs, side of bacon, side of avocado. Our bill was 12 bucks you know. So as someone who tips, if I was to say okay we're 10% of that, means you're in a buck 25. Dollar 25 is what he made for all his efforts. If I do 15% it's like 2 bucks, I do 30% it's like 3. And the server was a young dude and I'm like man like, dude instead of getting a job at iHop where the average ticket is like 12 bucks, if you're doing the same work but got a job at a steakhouse where the average ticket is like 50 or 100 bucks, if my bill is 12 bucks you're getting a dollar 20, if it's 112 bucks you're getting 10 dollars. The moral of the story is like go and sell more expensive stuff because you're getting paid a percentage of the ticket price right? Number two, think about all gardens start doing this a little while ago and it was brilliant. When you get done eating they say hey what would you like to order for tomorrow? And they had a second meal so you'd order a second meal to take home and eat the next day. Like now you just doubled your ticket price because you only sold them two meals instead of one. I don't know what percentage you take it but I know there's a big percentage to take the second meal. Like if I was serving tables today the first thing I would be doing is offering them dessert then I take their meal and then at the end of the meal I'm like that was good huh? I know you guys aren't going to come back tomorrow but if you want you can order off the menu right now and I'll go package up and then you can have this tomorrow as well. And so I'd be thinking like increase value, increase value, how can I increase my ticket right? So that's the five serving tables again. Now obviously I'm not serving tables. I'm serving entrepreneurs and a lot of them but guess what I'm thinking the same thing. It's the same stuff right? I know I get paid based on a percentage of what our growth is. Like as the entrepreneur and the company the way that I make my money I do have a salary because I think you legally have to do that. The rest of my payment comes from a percentage of profit share right? So the more profit the more I get to share. So I'm always thinking like well how can I increase my profit share? How can I increase the ticket values? How can I sell more expensive stuff? How can I sell more things? And what's interesting is a lot of times speaking to you right now probably most of us we undervalue what we do right? Sometimes we put like our own pricing values on other people's like oh I would pay $1,000 for this so you won't sell for $1,000. It's like no you don't understand like that's worth that to somebody else. Like don't try to discount your prices. And so a lot of times what we do is we try to discount our prices. We try to like lower ticket and so like we're trying to like go back to IHOP and sell even though we know that the money that we make as entrepreneurs is based on the ticket price. Right? So the bigger the ticket price the bigger money you make. I've said this before and I'll say it again. Dad Kennedy once told me this. He said there's no strategic advantage of being the second lowest price leader in your market right? But there is a huge strategic advantage of being like I am the most expensive guy in my market. Don't be the dudes in the middle so I want you to think about that. Okay because you're an entrepreneur you're just like a server. You're serving customers, serving audiences and you get paid based on the ticket price of what people are spending. That's why funnels are important. If I just sold people my free book and that was it, guess what I would be right now? I'd be broke. Okay I did a Facebook live yesterday showing the three funnels we had in the past. When all of a sudden when our book launches over we get over $3 million in collected revenue. Now obviously it wasn't net but that was collected gross. What's funny is I look at all these people do these big huge product launches like two, three, five thousand dollar product launches and most of them are happy to make a million to $3 million. So I'm like we did the same thing and we were keeping away free book. Okay how? It's because I'm just like the server right? Like I offered dessert first and I had upsells. I offered them second meal. I did all these kind of things because I'm trying to increase the ticket price. Because that's how I get fed as an entrepreneur plus gives me the ability to serve that irons better. The server lets you order food and take it home. He's serving you at a higher level. That's why he gets paid more. You notice that increased ticket price but he's able to first off make the restaurant more revenue but second off he gives you a better experience. You gotta have great meal twice. Your wife doesn't cook tomorrow or whatever that might be or maybe it's you cooking whatever. It all comes down to that. That's the moral of today's story. I hope that helps some of you guys. I'm sure some of you guys are like all freaking out trying to be the cheapest possible person and it doesn't always work that way. Obviously you gotta look at what the market will bear. Like I said it's way better. Typically it can be the most expensive than the cheapest. So there you go.
