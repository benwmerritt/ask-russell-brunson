Hey, my name is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you back to my YouTube channel. Now during today's video, I'm going to talk about the path from going from zero to a million dollars inside of your business. But before we do on make sure you take a second to subscribe on the link down below. Make sure you're subscribed to the channel and also turn on your notifications that way whenever a new video comes out, you get notified first. Okay, with that said, I'm gonna walk you through the path from going from zero to a million dollars. The man, Russell. Hey, just sell your product. I love this guy. Love this guy. I honestly believe the entrepreneurs are the only people that can actually change this planet. So the reason why I want to do this video is because it's one of the questions I get asked the most from people is how in the world do you get to a million dollars? And the reason why they ask that to me a lot is because some of you guys have seen before the pictures of people holding up those two comic book awards. Well, I'm the guy who gives people those awards. In fact, we've given away over 800 two comic book awards to date from people, entrepreneurs, people just like you who took their products, their services and were able to make over a million dollars inside of a funnel. So the question is, well, how do you do it? I think the thing that most people think is they think, well, the secret, I gotta find the right product or I gotta find something that nobody knows about it. They're so stressed about figuring out like this loophole or this hack where the reality is that's not how you grow a business. How you grow your business a little bit back which is why most people don't ever have success. The first step to grow a successful business is you have to figure out who is the dream customer. Who is it you want to sell your products and your services to? This has got to be somebody that you're passionate about, someone that you would want to sell it. You'd want to serve, you want to create products, you want to do things for them no matter what even if you weren't making any money. That's the first step. So for me and my company when I got started, I knew that the people I wanted to serve were entrepreneurs, I was an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs had changed my life. I wanted to be able to serve them at the highest level so that became my dream customer. And the second question is that after you figure out who is he you want to serve, you have to figure out what is it they actually want? Now the problem most people have is they go and they try to create a product and then shove it down these customer's throats. And that's not the secret. The secret is you have to listen to your dream customer. Okay, being successful is nothing to you being creative has a hundred percent to do with you being able to listen to your dream customer. Listen to what they want, what are they struggling with? What are the problems they have? And then from that, that's where you get ideas for the products and the services you could sell. My very first book was a book called dot com secrets. And it is because I was listening to the entrepreneurs I wanted to serve and they were struggling selling their products online. They didn't understand funnels, they didn't know what to do. And so because of that, I wrote my very first book and it became an instant best seller. Our software company ClickFunnels came from mislisting the customer saying, hey, I understand this funnel thing, but I'm confused. I can't figure out how to do it. I'm trying to hire people I'm struggling and that was from the idea came. Let's make software that makes this simpler. So it's not being creative, it's listening to what they want and then actually just creating the exact same thing that they just asked you for. So step number one, who's your dream customer? Step number two is what do they actually want? And the step number three is go and create that thing. The nicest thing about this is you don't have to be super creative. So many people are like, why can't do this because I'm not creative. You don't have to be creative. You just have to listen and then go figure out what does they want and then go and create it. And so that's the next part. Now for you, it could be a book. It might be a course. It might be a training program. Maybe it's a physical product. It doesn't really matter. It's listening to your audience and figuring out what they actually want. So after you figure that out, then the next step after you got a product, you got to figure out how to sell it. And this is where a lot of people get stuck. I always tell people there's two parts of selling. You got to figure out what you're going to sell and then how you're going to sell it. So if you have a product, let's say you have a book, you've got your course, you've got your thing you're going to sell. There's a lot of different ways to sell things, obviously. You can sell things on the phone. You can sell them through webinars. You can sell them through YouTube videos. There's a lot of different ways. You got to figure out what is the method that's going to work the best for you. You'll know you've got the right what, which is the right product and the right how, how to sell it as soon as it starts taking off. Your business will take off literally overnight. And I can show you case study after case study after case study of entrepreneurs who try and they fail. They try and they fail. They try and they fail. And the secret wasn't the hack. It was, oh, this is the product they wanted. And this is how I'm going to sell it. You put those two things together. If you get the right what and the right how, that's when your business takes off. And that's the path to get from zero to a million dollars as quick as possible. All right, so hopefully in your mind now you're thinking about your what and your how.
