Hey, this is Russell. Welcome back to the show. Today I want to talk about something that I have never talked about before publicly, but I think it's something that will be really powerful for you. It's called the content launch funnel. And this is really one of the secrets to selling anything without selling anything. Okay. And I may seem confusing at first, but come back with me and explain how this thing works because it gives you the ability where you can literally email your list every single day and they never get frustrated, they never get burned out. They never get tired. In fact, they start looking forward to emails. And at the same time, it converts more of these people, every single open or every single clicker into a buyer, which is the key. And so that's what we're talking about today. So if you want to drive more traffic, if you want to send more emails, you have more success, this content launch funnels concept is something new that I've been, I've been tinkering out there for like the last man, four years now. Okay. So the very first type of funnel that support and understand is what's called a product launch funnel. And this is the funnel that was made famous by Jeff Walker. If you've ever gone through Jeff Walker's PLF course, product launch formula, that's what he's teaching is how to do a product launch funnel. Jeff calls it a sideways sales letter, which is kind of fun. I always think about like this long form sales letter to sell your product, your service, and it's sideways, like tips over and then breaks it like four different things. Right. So if you look at your traditional Jeff Walker style, um, product launch funnel, it's the way it works, right? The very first step, you go on this landing page, you put in your email address and then after that, you get put on an email list, right? And then what's going to happen is typically they're going to have four videos. Okay. Video number one, uh, is going to be there. And usually like, depending on how you do the product launch, or some people who do a lot of pre-launch and they, they'll release video one then a week later, video two, a week later, video three, a week later, video four. Some people do it evergreen work every 48 hours, unlocks one. Others do it where it's like you get video one, when it's done, then you can go to video two and then video three and video four. But these four videos are all about setting up a sale, right? Same way. If you were to read like a long form, like, you know, 60 page sales letter, the first part of the sales letter is video number one. Second part of sales letters, video two, third part of sales, there's a video three and the fourth part of the sales letters where you actually sell the offer. Uh, number three is going to be your internal, a false beliefs number four is going to be external and then you make the pitch. Right. So it's, it's different, but very similar model. Right. It's how you break up the four videos. And so that's kind of the concept, how Jeff Walker runs his product launch funnel. So yeah, I'm sure you've seen him before. If not, that's kind of the way it works. Um, so an ops in there's a video, you know, couple days later at video two, video three and video four, then makes a special offer. Okay. And, uh, and so that's what the, that's what product launch funnel looks like. And so from a structure standpoint, we're using very similar structure with the content launch funnel, but different strategies. So I don't want you thinking, oh, Russell's teaching a product launch funnel. I'm not. Okay. It's just understanding the strategy. In fact, if you look at a traditional product launch funnel, um, you'll see, usually the top, there's like four videos and like video one will be unlocked and video two, three and four. There's a lock sign that get locked down. Like you can't get him until the release video two and then video three and video four. Right. But we still had like, if you were to click phones.com, there was like, um, there was a trial, like a four to date trial. Right. And so the one thing we added was on the, thank you page. I have someone to register for the webinar. This was Todd's, Berlin idea. Todd Dickerson, my business partner, Todd said, Hey, let's add this thing where it basically make a video. Say, Hey, thank you for registering for the webinar. It's going to start in two days, whatever. Um, but before you set, you, you show up, register for a son for free click, for those trial down below and just play with it a little bit. And then during the presentation, I'm going to show you how to use it. I'm going to walk you through it, but make sure you have an account right now so you can use it again as four to date trials. You can cancel afterwards, but make sure you have the trial when you show up at the webinar and again, there's free four to date trial down below. So we add that one little thing in there, um, on the thank you page. And what's crazy, like in hindsight, now going back a decade, year number one of click funnels, um, we ended up getting, um, 2,500 people ended up buying the $1,000 offer I made at the end of the webinar, which is great. Right. It's a really good business, but what's even better is 7,500 people, um, created a trial on the thank you page and stuck. So we had 75, um, 7,500 people paying $97 a month for click funnels after the first 12 months. So it's crazy. You look at like most people do webinar like, oh, we did you was 25, 500 times a thousand, right? We had two and a half million dollars in sales. That's great. Right. But what you don't understand is that 7,500 times 97 is $7.5 million. No, it's more, no, what's the math? And anyway, it's, it's like, uh, at least close to $9 million a year in recurring revenue, right? Way more profitable than what we sold on the webinar. It was that little tweak, little hinge that swung a huge door. Right. And so, um, we started calling these thank you page, Mifki's, what's a Mifki? Mifki stands for the most incredible free gift ever. I learned this today at Kennedy when I bought Dan Kennedy's company. It was funny. Um, you know, I'm, I'm a consultant as well. So when I consult the company, I look at like, what's already working and then how can we like double down on egg? How can we take that and prove upon it? Versus like scrap everything and start over. So when I bought Dan's company, I met with this whole team from out here to Boise and asked him, like, hey, you guys have been running this company for 40 years. Like what's the, like what, what's working, right? And they said, well, the thing that's been working for 40 years is the Mifki. And I was like, what? The Mifki? Yeah. The Mifki. And I remember I hated that word for a while. I was like, that's the most annoying word ever. Now I love it. Right. But, and I said, what's the Mifki? I said, oh, it's the most incredible free gift ever. M-I-F-G-E Mifki. Right. And they took the Mifki. And so what Dan Kennedy would do is when he launched his newsletter back in the day, it was like, Hey, when you sign up for my newsletter, you get all, you get like $10,000 worth of bonuses and money making advice for free. So it was like an irresistible offer. Right. And so when we launched the Dan Kennedy company, when I relaunched the company, we just made a really good Mifki offer. We launched it. And, and you know, that's how we, that's how we built that whole business and that brand again. And so that's what, that's what a Mifki is a really good offer. And so what we do inside of, um, uh, on the thank you page, Mifki, some of the registers for a webinar for a challenge for a launch, whatever it is. And then on the thank you page, after we thanked him to make him an irresistible offer, a Mifki offer, right? An offer they can't say no to. And so that's kind of what the Mifki is. All right. Uh, okay. So those are the two things you've got to understand. Okay. Number one was how the product launch funnel works and number two, how a Mifki funnel works. Okay. Now, what we're going to be talking about differently, we're going to do today again, is, um, is the secret to selling basically anything without selling anything. Okay. And I call us the content launch funnel. And we started this four years ago where basically like I have a ton of offers, right? I have more offers than probably anyone on the planet. I've got my doc, I'm secrets book experts, secrets book, traffic secrets book, perfect webinar script. I've got list building secrets. I've got, like there's, there's tons, click funnels and funnel hacks, funnel hacks, webinar. And like I have so many offers. What I'm doing is I'm taking the offer. So for, let's just say, for example, here we go. Dot com secrets book, right? So say I'm going to sell the doc com secrets book. I can send four emails, five emails to my list. So in the book, but then it's like, okay, Russell, we got the gist, like you're selling us a book, like there's no value or other than just us buying your offer. So I'm, okay, how can I do this? I started looking back, like, what are all the things I've done over the years content rise around doc com secrets, right? And I found there was like, there was the, I did a one day event going through all the stuff inside of doc com secrets. I did a three day event. I had spoken on tons of you's podcasts. I spoke on sage multiple times. Like I have so many cool things teach of doc com secrets book and me teaching things really cool spots, right? So I thought like instead of me just selling the book, what if I go back and I find a bunch of that content and I let people watch that for free. So they get a taste of the book, right? The candy. Um, and then inside of that, then I offer them the irresistible offer, the most incredible free gift ever. Right? Like, what does that look like? And so what we do is we, we took, um, again, I took, I took four videos. Okay. That's it. I have four videos and have an offer. Like, what's the right funnel I can use? I was like, what if I use the product launch funnel, but instead of having these, these product launch videos all set up to launch $2,000 course or something. What if it was like this? Okay. So basically this is what it looks like right now. This is what the content launch funnel looks like. Somebody. So we have a landing page that says, Hey, um, I, you know, I've been teaching people how to have success with funnels for the last, you know, 10 years. Um, I'm a best selling author teaching this concept, but I've got four videos that I've done throughout throughout my life teaching like the most important things. I did one over here, one over here, one over here. You know, like people have spent $5,000 to be this event in 2000. It was like, like these are real actual, like valuable videos. If you want to get free access to them, give me email address. Right? So I turned to a lead magnet. So someone comes in and they want access to these cool videos. They put in their email address, right? Email address goes in. Boom. They go to the next page and the next page was slide in the thank you page of Mifki. Okay. Hey, thank you so much for a registering for the dot com secrets training series. Um, if you haven't read the book yet, there's a link down below. You can get the book, get a free copy of the books, cover shipping handling links down below. Uh, you can get free copy. Um, and then they go down and they say, yes, get free copy or no, say, no, thanks. Boom. It takes them over to video number one. They say yes, takes to the book funnel and then takes them back to video number, number one, right? So either way. Now what happens is a percentage of people buy the book right there, but a bigger percentage don't write. They go, they bypass the book and watch video number one. So watching video number one, free video, free training. It's awesome. It's like, you know, for me, it's like a 60 minute video, like something that people would pay for other places. Right. But they're watching this video and the video is me going deep into one of the chapters from the dot com secrets book. They watch it and learn like, this is amazing. Right. So now they're at the peak site and they just like witness an hour me teaching this thing like, this is awesome. I want some more. And guess what? Right below the video is linked. Says, Hey, um, get a copy of my book right here. Like, oh, and they go get a copy of the book. You know, they opt. They go get a copy of the book. Okay. Now, um, after they've registered, they put their email address and opt in page. Now there's the, you know, immediately they can email pushes into video number two, but then day number two, they get a video pushes into video number two, like, Hey, I hope you enjoyed yesterday's video. If you missed it, here's a link to watch yesterday's video, but today I gave you another video. This is one I had a chance to speak at so and so event. I wanted it to go deep on this concept. And so this is, you know, from chapter 13 of the book, but if you want to go watch a free hour long session on how to do this, click here and they go there. Boom. To video number two in the product launch of the content launch funnel. Right. And so, um, if you look at the way the page structure up top, you can see like, there's, there's, uh, there's the four videos, right? And so when they go to video number one, video number one's open and video two, three and four, the little image has locked icon. Right. When they go to video number two, right now video number one and the number two are open. So they can click back and forth and go back to video one and two. Wanted to sing, watch one or two, but three and four are still locked down. Right. So they watch video number two, like, oh, I want to watch video number three, but I can't. Oh, but then Russell's talking about his book again. Like, oh, so also in another percentage or like, I got a lot of people on the thank you page, you bought the book. A lot of people on video one bought the book, but I'm a video number two, just given value, right? They have a chance to go in there, watch video two, if they like it, boom, then they go by the book and then they do something video three next day. Hey, here's video one and two again, but if you, you know, if you haven't watched them now, here's the video number three, which is the, which is me teaching this concept, go watch it, boom, all pushes down to the exact same offer. Um, and that's kind of the way the works. Okay. So if you look at our email sequence, the way it works right now is what we'll do is each week we pick a new content launch funnel that we're going to focus on. Right. So for example, in my business right now, time I'm recording this next week is the expert secrets, uh, is the offer expert secrets book is the offer. And so we have a content launch funnel in front of that that wraps is Mifki candy. It's candy and wrapping around this irresistible offer. I'd most incredible, uh, gift ever. Um, and so we'll do is the email list will send out three emails, one, two, three, trying to get them to opt in to register for the free content. Okay. And if they do, then they're taken off that email list temporarily, then they get the emails pushing them from, from a video one to two, to three to four. Okay. And then after video four, then we do two more emails that just promote the book. Okay. Now, if they, if I send three emails and they don't ever opt into the list, that's okay. Video four or five, I just push them directly to the offer. Okay. So either way they're seeing the offer, but I'm wrapping it in candy first. Okay. So again, it's what I call Mifki candy. Um, and so that's kind of that's how we structured. That makes sense. And so, so again, uh, next week we're doing expert secrets. The week after that we're doing perfect webinars. What did I do? I found really cool spots of me in Mexico teaching perfect webinar, me in the UK teaching perfect way, different pieces of it. Boom, boom, boom, they opt in for four free videos teaching concepts from the book. Boom. Thank you page. They get in perfect webinars on a book. It's a $7 course, but then we push them the most incredible free gift ever is a $7 course, right? Um, and so on and so forth. So that's what a content launch funnel looks like. That makes sense. Okay. Now, obviously if you want to sell stuff online, you're going to need a good funnel, but if you want a great funnel, then you're going to need to use click funnels. Click funnels is the number one funnel builder in the world, helping more first time entrepreneurs to leave their nine to five and to launch a dream than any other company in the world. Click funnels was built for the dreamers and the doers. You can get a free four day trial by clicking a link in the description or going to click funnels.com slash YouTube right now. Click funnels because you're one funnel away from changing the world. Okay. So now you guys understand this concept, right? What I want you to start thinking through is a couple of things. In fact, I got three steps for you. Okay. Step number one is figuring out what is the thing that you actually want to sell? Okay. Um, again, it could be a book, could be a course, could be, uh, your, your membership site could be content, it could be whatever it is, right? And so that's the first thing now. Um, I want to, I want to amplify a little bit. A lot of you, a lot of people miss this, right? Whenever I say a MIFC, the most incredible free gift ever. A lot of times I think about this, they think about this in relation to like how I, I traditionally teach in the past, which is like, if you're launching a membership site or you create a MIFC, they can really get offered to get people in the continuity, but the reality is every single offer I'm creating, I'm attaching it to a MIFC. Does that make sense? So again, I'll come back to the dot com secrets book, right? This is the book. It's free plus shipping with seven ninety five, get a copy of this book, right? But then if you go to dot com secrets, the common book on the page, like you don't just get this book, you also get, I have like six different things. Okay. You get these six things for free when you buy the book. Okay. So when you buy the book, you get these six. So I think, uh, if I went to the page, it's like, you get, there's like a 30 challenge, there's, um, two or three, um, other ebooks, there's a two or three video courses, so you get all these things, right? So I took those things. That is the most incredible free gift ever you get for free when you get a copy of the book. Okay. So every offer I create, there's a MIFC. The MIFC is always the free stuff they get. You're attaching to the core product you're trying to sell. Does that make sense? Okay. So step one was that you're trying to sell. What is the offer? And then what is the, the, the bonuses, the, the most incredible free get ever you're attaching to the offer. And the reason why I do that, because I want to make this very, very special. When somebody comes to my, um, my content launch funnel and they opt in the next page was to, Hey, congratulations. I'm going to give you a very special offer. Okay. When you buy my book right now, I'm going to give you all these things for free. Right. Like that's how I structure this irresistible offer. Um, it's very simple. It's very easy. Um, it's a MIFC. So it's attaching a MIFC to anything that you're selling. So when I'm selling a continuity of membership side, I say, use a MIFC to do that. I'm just attaching a MIFC to that. Right. But if I'm selling a 10,000 offer, give them the same, my 10,000 offers, a coaching program, what's my MIFC? Okay. It's all the other bonuses they're getting them attaching to that core offer. Does that make sense? So don't think of MIFC is only for memberships and continuity. Right. It's for when you're selling anything. Okay. So step one, what is the thing you want to sell? And you're going to attach an offer around it. Okay. That's step one. Now we're going to move to step number two. So step number two, the thing I started thinking through is like, okay, um, I've got this product, this offer I'm trying to sell. What are all of the things that I've done in the past to create content for it? Right. And for most of you guys, if you are, you know, if you are a producer or a publisher, you're putting things out there, you probably done YouTube videos. You probably been on people's podcasts. You've been in your own podcasts. Right. So I'm looking for those things. I'm looking for things to have like a unique story where somebody is interviewing me or I did it somewhere, a unique spot, or I went deep on one topic or, um, you know, whatever it might be. So for example, really good one to expert secrets. Um, I had a chance I was in Dean grass, you'll see, and, um, and, uh, Joe Paul's is genius network X, which is their hundred K groups. You have to be, you have to spend $100,000 to be in this room. Right. And so, um, the very first time before I finished the book, I did a session there where I taught, I taught the concepts in the book, right? It was on a whiteboard and stuff and recorded it. And so, um, it's me teaching part of the book, but there's a story behind it. Right. What's the story? It's like, well, I was at this event. It's called genius X where I spent a hundred thousand. Everyone in the room spent $100,000 to be in this room. Right. And I had the, the leaked recordings of me teaching this book before it's published. I taught things that didn't actually make it to the final copy of the book. You can get a, you can go listen. You can go, uh, you know, if you give me an email address, I can get that to you for free. Right. So boom, they get that video. And then there's another video, another video. That makes sense. Well, I'm finding like things that have a unique story around the content. That way, when I'm, when I'm sending out the three emails prior, I'm going to say, Hey, opt in to go get a thing. Hey, opt in to go get for free training. Hey, opt in. Right. I'm saying something very unique. Like, Hey, I've got three videos. Here's what the first one is. Give me an email address. You're going to get this one that happened at the genius event. Right. The day number two, it's like, Hey, um, uh, there's this other video that's blah, blah, blah, just insert story about this video. Why it's so cool. Why you want it? This is video number two makes you opt in so you get video number two. And then here's video number three. There doesn't have to be videos. And, um, you know, it could be, I mean, it could be a webinar. It could be a PDF. It could be, like, it could be a lot of different. It doesn't have to be videos. Me videos are easier for me, but it may be different for you. Something else might be different. Might be content, right? And it doesn't have to be four videos. Like a product launch funnel traditionally has got four videos, right? That's the way Jeff Walker always taught it. But I have some of these where I've just have three videos. Somewhere I only have two. Okay. There's also somewhere I only have one and that's okay too. Right. Um, nothing wrong with that. In fact, I'm going to teach you has one really cool secret that you can do. Um, I had a chance a while ago to interview Ryan holiday on stoicism, right? So I had this interview with Ryan teaching stoicism, all the core pillars of stoicism, all this kind of stuff. Right. So what do I have? I've got a video teaching what I call stoic secrets, right? And so, and, um, unfortunately, let me use the domain name, uh, but I had stoic secrets.com for a long time, right? And when someone opt in stoic secrets.com, okay, this is a content launch funnel. I was just taking a podcast interview. I did, right? So somebody would opt in to see the interview through Ryan holiday. The next page is like, Hey, thank you so much for opting in for the, for the interview. Um, before you, I take you to the interview. I want to make you a special offer, right? Boom. I dropped my MIFC right there, which for me, the MIFC was for secrets of success. Right. So I create the MIFC, I drop it, boom, uh, people sent it for the trial for the success. And then from there afterwards, boom, they get taken to go watch the interview through Ryan interview through Ryan is 60 minutes long. And then what happens in the end of the interview? Yep. I pitch him back to the same MIFC again. Right. And there's two emails now pushing back like, Hey, and begin because I only had one video. I just had three emails, the same video like, Hey, did you have a chance to watch it? Hey, if you missed yesterday, make sure you watch it. Hey, I'm pulling it down and going to watch it. Right. So I'm keep pushing people back to that thing. Okay. And so, um, it's interesting because like literally you can do this strategy of like every, every piece of content. I see people who've done a hundred, uh, interviews for their podcast. I have a hundred videos and they put them on, on podcasts, on YouTube and then they kind of forget about them. Right. That's like, you can take those and you want, you can publish them in their places. Right. Like last night I was going back through, um, my YouTube channel and just like, all the videos from four or five years ago, and there's something I have like half a million views on them. And they're great. Like they're getting more views than any of my videos nowadays are getting like for whatever reason. Right. But there's some really good ones about like, uh, how to structure funnel. They're like top secrets about funnel. Like, so I'm pulling some of my old YouTube videos and boom, plugging them to the content funnel. So like go back in your archives, like you have content in other places. Okay. If not, you can create it. So a good example with my secrets of success business, um, I had, um, I had a book that I wanted to promote. So I found three other people who were nerdy like me, who love books. I sent them a copy of the books. One was Joe Vitale. What was Eileen Wilder was Annie Grace. I said, all of those guys, it's already the book and I want to interview each of you guys on one of the chapters of the book. Right. So somebody would come and they would opt in. Uh, in fact, I pulled the page up here a second ago and if I could find it and tell you guys if you want to go see it. Um, um, do, do, do. Okay. If you go to, um, well, it's kind of long dang secrets of success. Dot com slash how dash to dash get dash anything dash you dash want dash challenge. I gotta find a better name than that. Anyway, that's, that's where it's at. Uh, YouTube will drop a link down below. Maybe the podcast we can as well, but, uh, there's, there's the challenge. It's, it's free thing. Right. So opt in and call them a three day challenge and day number one, it's me interviewing Joe Vitale day. Number two is me interviewing Eileen Wilder. Day number three is me interviewing Annie Grace and guess what we do after the register, there's the thank you page, Mifki. Okay. That interview Joe Vitale, we talked about the book is fair chapter. We pushed it back to the Mifki day. Number two, Eileen Wilder, me talk about the book and pushing on the Mifki day. Number three, Annie Grace back to the Mifki's. That makes sense. So literally that's how we do it. And the same thing with the Robert Collier book, right? We had a three day event on Robert Collier and like the same process. Right. So we're creating the content around the offer to push to the offer. So it, it hopefully makes you start thinking about content a little bit differently. Um, where like all these, the, the things you're doing to create content anyway, now are more valuable than just, just the one thing, you know, I created a podcast and it's gone, right? I put on YouTube and now it's gone. Like I always think about YouTube and podcasts and stuff are great ways to get people into my funnels, right? Obviously, but then those videos, I can use them inside of a funnel, especially for this type of content launch funnel. Okay. Okay. So again, number one, I feel like what you want to sell and attach a Mifki to it. Number two, what content do you have around that? What could you create? What content has stories? Who could you interview about? Like, what are things you can pull in? What stuff have you done in the past already on a YouTube channel or a podcast? Um, you know, you could, uh, one of my friends, oh, Matt Bay sack back in the heat, the one really cool. And I'm his wife, they just laid in bed and they, they talked about, I can't remember what they were talking about. It was like an hour long. They called it pillow talk. Like my wife and I were talking about late at night. Like you just got to go grab your microphone, record something. There's so many cool ways to do it. Right. Uh, but creating the content around it. And the step number three, in fact, I mean, sorry, you come back. If you had a book, it could be just reading. I read chapter one or chapter six or a chapter 12. Like they could be just you reading a couple of chapters. That could be it too. Right. Okay. Now step number three, um, this is how we structure at least how we're structuring the emails, right? So I sent three emails to get them to opt in to the content launch for that week. Okay. Email one, email two, email three, each email is talking about a different story from the videos inside the members area. Boom. Okay. Um, after they opt in, then, then, uh, again, I pull them off that email. If they won't get it, they'll throw three more emails. Um, and then from there, they get the emails inside the content launch, right? So video number one, video two, video number three. Okay. And then after that, then boom, ever gets back on with the two, we said two emails directly to the offer to everybody. So even the people, the people who didn't opt in and then the people did opt in and push two emails to the offer to close, to close people on, on the actual sale. All right. Now the very first time I did this, like four or five years ago, this is what I did. And I'm actually going to teach you guys a way to do it differently because, um, eventually, uh, Tim Shields, uh, who just spoke at our last funnel hacking live, he taught me a way that was different back. He talked, if you were at funnel hacking live, he dropped it in the last 30 seconds of his presentation and most people missed it. But it was like the secret sauce. This. So what we did the very first time is we build out these content launch funnels and we have like 30 of them. Like it was a long sequence, right? So we're opting to go to the first ones, the next one, the next one, next one. And it was great. But the problem is like I dumped after we had that whole thing structure, which took way too long. I dumped everyone at the top of the funnel and then for next like 30 weeks, they were going through this gauntlet. I had a promo FHL. So kind of like threw things off. It's like, I can't email my list because it's gonna email us here. Just it didn't kind of work. We're not really, but we structured when someone joined any of my email lists, they would drop at the top of that and they'd go through this whole, this whole gauntlet, right? It was pretty cool. But the problem is like when they got in this gauntlet, then if we promoted anything extra, it's kind of threw things off. And so we ran that for a couple of years and then it's just kind of fallen apart and I needed to rebuild and kind of restructure our offers and things. And so I was thinking like, what do we do for this? What are the, what are the pieces? Right. Um, and then, um, Tim Shields, it, uh, what he, he taught me what he was doing. It was so cool as he basically, Tim's got, um, I think nine webinars, right? They're all auto webinars. When he does this, he spends a week promoting webinar number one. And then what's done, they transition to week number two, does webinar two, and then webinar three and goes through the nine weeks. When it's done, he starts back over the top again. And he goes back through and it's done. He starts back over the top. And every time he creates a new webinar, he just stops the campaign and he plug in the new webinar and I was at 10 webinars, right? And he goes back through and this starts back, and this is his whole cycle, cycle week after week after week. Now Tim's built a, um, an eight figure year business in the photography market. Like it's really powerful. What he's doing. And so I assume he had just Daisy chained them all together and it was just, anyway, he said, no, no, he's like, I don't do that way. He's like the way I do it. And by the way, this is the big, uh, hot. So what we're doing ours differently this time around, right? He said that I have a spreadsheet. So I, the, I, the first week when we do the spreadsheet, we have the emails, we look at the things we send them all out, right? Then the next one we do, but it's always lives in real time. So we can like see what's happening in the market. We need to stop or anything. You know, is there, is there something specific that happened today in pop culture that like we tweaked the email would fit for that, right? The bond that I, and then when it gets done, they're all night, starts back to the top one again and looks at, okay, last time we did this, what were the open rates for the click through is how did it all look? So what can we tweak this time? Like maybe we, you know, email two didn't really work. Maybe the store wasn't right. So like they go and tweak a couple of things and then boom, it goes out. Um, and then next week come to, you know, number two and they do it again. They keep going through. That's the whole process. So for me, that's what we're working on right now as well is we're going back through and basically every offer I have, and this is not, this is in the Russell business, the click funds business, PT barn and business, um, or Barn and PT business. Um, which if you don't know about Barn and PT, go to Barn and PT.com. It's cool plugin, but we're building a whole character around Barnum. Um, uh, the magnetic marketing, that Kennedy business and secret success, success business. So we're doing one of these each brand each week. So it's kind of intense, uh, but it's so cool. And so what we're doing is basically, like I said, it's like next week, we've got two of them launching, right? So we've got number one, we've got the Russell business, click funds business, both launching and that one will go out. Boom. Right. And next week, the next one, and then base, how many offers we have, let's keep going deep when we get to the bottom, they start back over and just keep going. You know, whichever one it is. And then, um, when we have new offers, we just create new offer. And then we just pause wherever it's at, plug in new offering and launch that one. Add it to the thing. And then that'll come back up next time it comes back around. Say you send email to a hundred thousand people, you might get 30 or 40,000, actually open email, right? Uh, and you know, from that 5,000, the click, right? So only 5,000 people ever actually saw the opt-in page from there, maybe 2000, actually opted in, right? So here's the funnel, right? So yeah, maybe those 2000 people actually saw it, but the other 98,000 didn't, right? So nine weeks later, now you hit them again. And maybe this time they're more ready or maybe something in their life is different. Um, I have a friend in the dating market. He emails his list 90 times a day, nine. I was like, nine times a day, you're crazy. He said, no, you don't understand. He's like the dudes who follow me, he's like, they have a relationship because I'm fun on my emails and stuff. He's like, but most of them, um, have a girlfriend most of the time, right? And he's like, but there's this little window of time that happens. Everyone's small where their girlfriend breaks up with them. And when that window happens, I need to be the first email in the inbox. Right. So they're reading for entertainment most of the time and their heart gets broken and boom, they open email and I'm right there. And then they buy. He's like, I always got to be in front of them. Okay. So same thing's kind of true with you as well. Let's think about it. Like, and, and by doing it this way, right? You're not just hitting with tons of tons of offers, right? They're getting three days, four day long, like content launch campaigns every week. Right. There's like, man, this Russell's serving. He's giving me more stuff and more cool stuff and more cool stuff and more cool stuff. Right. And it builds this really cool reprosity, rep reciprocity. That's right. Word where they continue to open emails, even though they don't read them on the watch at all, a lot of times people go into like, they'll, they'll take the emails that I sent him and they'll create like a little, um, a folder. They save them there. Cause like Russell stuff's so good. Like if I just want to buy a course and set up by the course, I'll go back and just watch Russell's videos cause his training videos, he gives way for free around everyone of his offers are better than most people's offers. Right. And so that's kind of what you're trying to do is just build this, uh, this content engine where people are, um, getting a lot of value. So I know a lot of times in the internet world, we talk about using content, right? But we're talking about Instagram and YouTube and podcasts and those things are all great, but for me to this day, and I've been doing this now for two and a half decades, the channel that makes us the most amount of money is still, and not by a small, like, like 90, 10 is still email. Email is the secret. That's how we make our money. Right. That's the most important thing to understand. So when you understand that it's like, okay, how do we build a content machine around our email? Cause that's the thing that's actually making us the money. That's where people are missing it. Right. They have content machines happening all the other places, which are great. Do those things with that said, you guys, if you have a funnel, but it's not converting the problem 99.9% of the time, it should funnel is good, but you suck at selling. If you want to learn how to sell, so your funnels will actually convert, then get a ticket to my next selling online event by clicking a link in the description or go to selling online.com slash YouTube right now. All right, you guys hope you enjoyed this episode. That is how you create a content launch formula. It literally is a secret selling anything without actually selling anything. Yours providing so much value that people want to buy your offers and they want to open your emails. They're going to archive emails. They're going to go back and read your emails. Unlike most people, it's all by using this one simple strategy. So you will see us doing it across all of our brands here. Again, we did a modified versions four years ago. This is an updated version. I'm so excited for, and I'm excited to see some of you guys kind of modeling as well, things going to change everything. Thanks so much. My name is Russell Brunson. I'll see you guys all soon.
