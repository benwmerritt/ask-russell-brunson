The secret to selling anything online isn't being spiritual, it's looking spiritual. That's why the number one thing people want from me is this. My hair. Crushed it. Crushed it, yeah. Killed it! Hi. Hi. Let's do one more. I'm going into a beauty supply store to hopefully find the perfect matching wig to match JP Sears hair. We are shooting a commercial with him but I'm super excited because this commercial is going to be hilarious. Yeah. Oh, it looks really amazing. It looks good. It actually like, you should wear this for Halloween. Go get JP for Halloween. Alright, it is way too early. Blake is looking pretty ominous right now. We are heading to the Dry Bar Comedy Club and there's a couple logistics happening that we're not entirely used to. Such as a makeup artist trying to put a bald cap on a dude who has super long hair. Thick. Red. We are here in Salt Lake City heading down to Provo, Utah to the Dry Bar Comedy Club. We actually have someone here at, what do you call, person best in hand with your luggage? Luggage handler? Luggage handler. We are at Vidangel Slash Dry Bar Comedy Club Slash Harmon Brothers headquarters. They produce some of the coolest infomercials you've ever seen. Squatty potty, Poo Poo, Fiber Fix, Saturday Save. I want comedy. I can't wait to get it. This is downtown Provo, Utah. Yeah, man. This is where it's happening. Fall colors, mountainous earth. So the whole reason we're here is because JP is setting the stage for tonight at our Dry Bar Comedy Club. We are so honored, thrilled, and excited to have him here. And then you've got the opportunity of basically kicking things off before Andrew Warner gets on stage with Russell. And talks about all of ClickFunnels' crazy startup stories. Yeah, I'm excited for it. You make it sound like the event revolves around me. It does. Which it doesn't. It totally does. I get to come in and have some fun, but it's going to be a great event. You see him? There is. Oh. Oh, that was a missed opportunity, yeah. I had him. Oh, good. I had him. That would be weird. So this is office goals right here. We make literally turn this space into a full out production studio, Dry Bar, Comedy Club, all these cool things. And it's all separated. This is going to be fun. This is going to be so cool. Oh. How's it going, guys? It's, I use at least one shelf of this stuff every day. How's it going? How are you? How are you? How's Natalie Hartman doing? Really good. He's on Keto and Rexia diet. Okay, so this is going to be a weird request. I have to ask her if they have his hair. Oh, JP's hair. So I need that hair. Exactly that. Yep. So there's an actual wig room. I love, you have a wig room. Well, I'm just trying to get dressed up as JP to have JP lookalikes running throughout all of Provo for Halloween. That's the idea. I have a sister with hair that color. Is it? You do? Yeah. She sounds beautiful. What are you thinking? Nope. Not close enough. No, JP. I'm thinking I wish I wasn't so attracted to you. Well, let me keep looking. See if I can find a darker. I'll get a little bit deeper. But actually, it's like, I don't know if I like it. You look really good on me. And then, and then it's just like, Whoa, which one's the real JP? The answer is I'm Dave. It feels like my wife would stop loving me if she saw me right now. It's kind of weird. This is so weird. It looks really natural though. Oh, it's so good. Oh. I just wish I had this kind of hair that I had the option of being bald. I'm just going to be bald regardless. That was three hours. Solid. Click funnels. I no longer have to do all the selling by myself. Hello, Army. You just made me bald so that we could make me have hair that is not my own instead of having my own. Rolling on sound. Moment of truth right here, funnel hackers. Get ready for it. That's why the number one thing people want from me is this. My hair. So good, but poor in the swell problem. You can see the shadow. You got a shadow? Yeah. See that funnel hackers? You got to fail before you have a success. That's why the number one thing people want from me, I'll take that from the top. That's why the number one thing people, such a tough line. All right, a little technical difficulty right now. The flower broke. So we're having to fix the flower. Unfortunately, we don't have a hot dry glue gun, whatever the things are called. Hot dry. That's done. Right now, everybody working on me. JP hair. If you're not in my funnel, you're dead to me. You got to be kidding me. So this is crazy. A little bit of a problem. We have a power surge going on in the building, and every time the generators things come on, the light flashes. So hope we're going to get this thing fixed here, turn off all the lights in that house, and focus just on this. And some people say the more money you make, the more impact you can have. But I like to say the more money you make, the more income you have. Then to triple my profits, I add in a quick order form. I add in a quick order form bump to buy my headband. I just love how easy it is to try. Some cheesy JP at jerk. Now take a jet. Take a jet. And what was it? All right, that's a wrap. That's a wrap. Yay! Nice job, little butcher. You have to be going to be dark. Let's all look into the light and cheer. We're going to sell or be sold. You got to shave or be sold on this one. All right, sales team, listen up. We've got to increase our monthly hair sales. Lance, have you sold a million dollars worth of hair this month? No. No. My name's Tom. So you're selling like a Lance, Tom. You should be ashamed of yourself. We got to sell more hair. Success, money, income, revenue, profits, all synonyms for making me rich. Because it's not about making me rich. It's about making the consumers out there more spiritual. The secret to selling anything online isn't being spiritual. It's looking spiritual. With my hair. I want you guys to go out there and sell more. What's your name, son? Steve. Steve. Steve, you should be ashamed of yourself. Why? You've been working with me for 10 years and I haven't even learned your name yet, Steve. It's how little you're selling. We got to be a team on this. Some people say, well, JP, I can't have long hair because I'm a swimmer. Well, you know what? Swimming is a stupid sport and you're not a dolphin. You can't spell hair without urr. Yeah, I want you to put more urr into your sales. Does that make sense? I don't even want you to think about money because it's not about the money. It's about the profits. If we sell more, we're going to bypass the money and just take in more profits in the form of a lot of money. Oh, man. And I just want you to listen up here. I want you to feel this. Wow. When you look at make JP rich, you can't spell rich without itch. And I've got an itch for some more profits. And team, I want you to go out and scratch my itch. Scratch itch. Scratch itch. Scratch itch. Scratch itch. The itch. The scratch. Sex sells, but you know what sells better than sex? Webinars. I want us to wear man thongs when we sell. Lisa, sell hair, upsell to armpit hair through our nude webinars to do 3.5 million in 89 minutes. You can't spell success without suck. And suck is exactly what you do, Lance. Look at what are you writing down, Lance? Make JP money, scratch the itch. You didn't even spell itch correctly. You spell it with a T. Can you fire Lance for me? I feel like he's holding us all back. And you can't spell make without act. And holding us back is exactly what Lance is doing. I just look at this hair. And do you know what I want every man, woman, child, dolphin, dog, cat, and parakeet in the world to have? I want them to have my hair because I don't even have my hair anymore. Do you know what this is really about? It's not about the profits. Income. It comes from within. Income comes from the Greek word that means a lot of freaking money. Some people say the more money you have, the more impact you can make. But I like to say the more money you have, the more income you have. More money is less on more than less money. Do y'all understand quadruple negatives? I want to see you guys excel. We got to sell more to make JP more rich. Does that make sense? JP looks. You can't be spiritual unless you look spiritual. Go to ClickFunnels.com and start making sales today. That wasn't a good slap. My hand got caught.
