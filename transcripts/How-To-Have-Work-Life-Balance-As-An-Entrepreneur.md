You need to hustle. But not in the way that you've been told. Let me explain. Over the years, I've seen so many entrepreneurs put out videos about how you need to hustle and how you gotta work hard to be successful. Hustle is putting it all in a line. Your number one prayer in life should be getting rich. You need to get rich fast. What you so threatened by? You threatened by the freaking hustle. Working 20 hours a day, seven days a week, like just grinding yourself as hard as you can to be successful. And the truth is they're actually right. You do need to hustle, but just for short periods of time. Recently, I gave this presentation at my two comic club X Mash in my meeting in Mexico to a bunch of amazing entrepreneurs and had a chance to show them the way to hustle correctly. During that presentation, I walked people through the process I go through to be able to achieve huge, crazy goals without sacrificing my entire life. And the key to understanding that is understanding two types of goals. Number one is called a hall of fame goal. And number two is a Super Bowl goal. There's a difference between a Super Bowl goal and a Hall of Fame goal. The Super Bowl goal is something you're trying to achieve now. Like a football team, each season starts and they decide, this is the goal we want to win a Super Bowl. And they focus all their effort on winning that goal. And that's the times you're going to have to hustle. This is the goal. This is the deadline. This is where we're going. But then there's an off season. You have a chance to get a break to step away from it for a moment. The second type of goal is a Hall of Fame goal. Think about it. If you're playing football, like, yeah, you want to win a Super Bowl. But when your career's over, you want to be in the Hall of Fame. You want to be able to have all the things you've been going after, right? And the same is true for us. So many of us have these Hall of Fame goals we want to do. And then we're trying to pursue all of them at once. And that's what causes the chaos, the stress, the burnout. And so what I want you to focus on is you're going to learn about in this presentation, is figure out what is your Super Bowl goal, defining it, and then just going and attacking that. Here's some examples that I can think of of a Hall of Fame goal. So it could be building a big business. It could be having a successful family. Maybe it's running a marathon. It could be traveling the world with your family, doing a whole bunch of really cool things, getting healthy. Those are all amazing Hall of Fame goals. Like when you pass away, you want to be able to say, this is the legacy left behind. Basically anything that you value that you really want to achieve. Now it's important to understand what your Hall of Fame goals are, because if you don't have those, you can win Super Bowl after Super Bowl after Super Bowl and never actually feel fulfilled. So in order for you to go accomplish your Super Bowl goal, you have to understand that greatness comes in times of radical imbalance. People always ask, Russell, how do you stay so balanced? And I don't. Everything great in my life came during times of radical imbalance. And that's what I want to share with you during this presentation. Hope you understand what radical imbalance is, how it works, how you can use it to hit your goals and be fulfilled and have a happy life. So if this video brought you any value, please let us know in the comments down below. And on top of that, I would love to know, what is your Super Bowl goal that you're going after right now and what is your Hall of Fame goal? And then be sure to also hit the like button.

I had a really interesting epiphany about an hour ago in my room as I was going through everything, get everything ready and praying and thinking and just all that kind of stuff. For me personally, and I'm sure a lot of you guys felt that as well, people who are driven, people who are doing these kind of things, like we're always like trying to chase the next thing for fulfillment or whatever. And like I had this big realization. And I've heard Tony Robbins talk about further than people say, but the realization I had is that based on today's session, like for me and for you, like we are enough already. We don't have to go and achieve something else. Like if we died today, if we're pursuing our values, we're doing these type of things already, like we could go and it'd be okay. And I was like, that was so relieving for me. I was like, oh my gosh, I feel like I just took this backpack off and just like, I'm good. Right? The interesting thing about the values is just that these aren't these huge goals we're trying to strive towards. Like if we're living the life that we want and we're following these things, like they're already fulfilled. You are enough today, which is really, really cool. That was my big epiphany. And then the second side of that was just like, everything we're going into today, which is going into the Super Bowl goal and purpose and all these other kinds of things. All of these things are amazing, but the reality is they don't really matter. In the grand scheme of things, the fact that I was wrestling, I spent 12 years of my life focusing and right after this goal didn't really matter, but man, it made my life fulfilling. The grand scheme of things, you build this huge business, doing all these kinds of things, like it doesn't really matter. It's just entertaining us while we're here on this earth, trying to do the best as we can. When you take that pressure off your back, like it doesn't really matter. The fact that I want to stay titled, I didn't, doesn't really matter. The fact that I went into a common club where I don't, doesn't really matter. The only thing that really matters at the end of the day is who I become. That's the key. If you can take that pressure off, then it becomes fun. This is the game. And if we lose, who cares? It doesn't really matter. One thing that matters is who I become along the journey. From a football analogy, we have a hall of fame goal, so what we want to do, the next thing is the Super Bowl goal. Now the nice thing about a Super Bowl goal is it's tangible. We can talk about it. We can look at it. We see like, this is the thing. There's the beginning, there's an end. Like that is the goal. When you're moving forward with definite of purpose, there's got to be a purpose, that actual thing that you're looking at. There's a target that you're going for. Too many people, the drifters, the 98% are just wandering with no purpose, no goal, nothing. They're just kind of here, moving around in circles. Us as the prime movers, we have a goal. We have a Super Bowl. Something we're looking for, we're striving towards. Once again, Napoleon Hill said that there's one quality which one must possess to win, and that is definite as a purpose, the knowledge of what one wants and a burning desire to possess it. The first thing we'll talk about is we have our values here, right? And so these are things we value in our life. Now what a lot of people try to do is like, okay, these are all the things I value. I'm going to go and try to do all of them at once because I value all these things and you start trying to do everything. What happens if you try to do everything at once? Everything is just kind of okay, right? In my life, everything that's ever been meaningful, every time I've had success, anything that's been like, that mattered, didn't happen in times of balance. Everything amazing came from times of radical imbalance. When I decided I wanted to be a wrestler and I wanted to be a state champ, that is my goal. I picked one value and I said, this is the thing I want to pursue. This is my Super Bowl during this season of my life. Okay, I'm going to pursue with everything I have. My energy, my focus, my time, everything, right? And because of that, guess what? All my other values kind of dropped down. I didn't have much time to spend with my family. I didn't have much time to do any schoolwork, which is why I was such a good student. I didn't have time to do all these other things because all my focus was on this thing, radically imbalanced, okay? But greatness comes during periods of radical imbalance. When Todd and I decided we want to build click funnels, it wasn't like, okay, we're going to be super balanced. We're going to spend eight hours working on click funnels and we're going to do this. It wouldn't have happened. It's impossible. What we were trying to create was monumental. It was bigger than anyone to ever accomplish before in the past in our market. Like if we're going to do this, we believe in this thing. We see a vision. We're picking this thing that we value. This is a mission-based thing, but if we're going to do it, we'd have the love and support of the people around us to be able to do that. Okay, now the one caveat I want to say here is you have to be careful. Again, this is a game we are playing. This doesn't matter. Okay, if something you are doing, if your radical imbalance destroys your Hall of Fame goals, it's not worth doing. At any time when Todd and I were working on this, if my marriage would have gotten in trouble or if something would happen where I'm going to lose my Hall of Fame, I would pull the rip cord and shoot it and it would have been out. A lot of us get into business and we start going there, we start going deep and we love it so much and it gives us such a passion and so much we start forgetting about all the other things in our life. We become unhealthy. We start getting a lot of weight. We start feeling good. We forget about our families and people we love. That's when it becomes not safe for the long term. Okay, radical imbalance is not something like for the rest of my life, I'm radically in balances for a season of time.
