We figured out a way that Grant Cardone's Head X events do 30 million dollars in an hour. What? Look at that. Boom, boom. I am freaking out right now. Can you tell you what happened? Oh, it's a machine. Who's in the office? Hey! What? Julie's in the office. So how was the flight? As good as it can be with four children. I've been up since 330 with my three-year-old. I am freaking out right now. I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out. I can't even tell you what happened. So I'm going to have Miles tell you because I can't even talk. So I opened up my email. It was a two-combo-clip application. You probably get like five to twenty a day. And this one is different because it's not someone who built a funnel and made a million dollars in it, which there's 340 plus who have done that now. But Spencer Meekum made a million dollars as a click funnel's affiliate. So that means Spencer has made click funnels. Two million dollars. Over two million dollars. That's a 1% of that. And so a million freaking dollars. Spencer, when you see this on Funnel Hacker TV, congratulations Freakin' Lations, man. That's insane. Back story here. Spencer did not even start promoting for us until last year in April. So this has been done in 14, 15, 16 months. You guys, all you click funnel's affiliates out there, keep crushing it and keep building on that momentum. If you follow what we were putting out there, you guys, if you screw this up, you're still going to succeed. We'll see you on the next episode of Funnel Hacker TV. Mic drop. Dude, check out who's in the office. What's up? What's up, bud? How are you, man? The one and only Alex Sharpe, and we're always excited. The party's about to officially start. Finally. So what's this event about? It's about team building. You know, so many people think team building is about how fast can you hire the right person and it really isn't. Team building is about understanding what the strategy for your organization is so you can anticipate what's coming next and fill the gaps before they happen because until you have a forward-looking strategy, you're always solving the problem that just happened. You're always putting out fires. And when you have a forward-looking strategy, you can anticipate what's coming, build that infrastructure ahead of time, and that's how you build teams. We're going to fire everyone after this thing, so it's going to be amazing. Sorry, guys. Sorry about all that. Alright, I'm racing down to downtown Boise right now because we actually have our two ComaClub X special presentation today from Alex Sharpe, and so super excited. And so I'm looking forward to seeing him talking about the billionaire code. How are you guys? Hey! You all did it! Good, man. Look! Alright, let's see you up. That's all the way. Pull this back all the way in the roof. Good. That's really good. Nice. Oh, that is... I'm here because... Okay, cool. What just happened in the last few minutes here? The rest of us are going to have a meeting. My brain doesn't really work. One hour later, when Rhino rushed in, he has a $30 million idea, and it's all over the whiteboard. Oh, there it is. We figured out a way at Grant Cardone's 10X event to do $30 million in an hour. What? I think. Well, here we are. We're calling our shots. This is Babe Ruth. Now we just got to make it happen. Alright, a little backstory. I'm sitting there having to join my lunch, and Ariel's like, God, check this thing out. You got to go for a workout right now. And I'm like, I didn't workout this morning. So we're really walking the streets of Boise because she drove from Indiana with this machine. Look at this thing. No excuses. So this is the solace? This is the solace. With this, you get to maximally load your muscles to max effort all the way through your entire repetition, both sides, concentrically, eccentrically, and we track the whole process. Alright, so we're going to try this thing out here, I think. Whew, that was so hard. I said that absolutely sucked. She actually was so kind. She actually said I did. 1600 pounds of work. 1600 pounds of work? It went in eight seconds. I have no idea what that means. I moved 1600 pounds in a minute. I'm so strong. How was it? Dude, it was crazy. I went for like 53 seconds. And resistance in both ways, like insane. Like you're trying to hold a robot back. It's really cool. I can still feel I'm super engaged. My abs were like crunching. Yeah, wild. We want to make sure we get into space because I have a feeling like it's a screamer out of space. Oh yeah, this is going to be good. This is a backwards ab moment, everybody. Go Stephen, go Stephen, go! You hear my hat off? Thank you. Thank you. I can put my head back. Stephen, great man. You're on a normal rep. This is not normal. I took a nitrous box right over for this. Nice. Look at those facts, baby. Come on. Push. Come on, nice. What do you think? It was good. I needed a nap. Holy crap. Keep going. Oh, dear. Come on, go for five. Push harder now. Come on. You care if I take my shirt off? I'm excited to show it. All mine. One, back. You got to be. You got to be. Look at that. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Your chest's going to be huge, man. Do it. Come on. Explain the numbers in. You're going to need to mark the testimonial here. It's a machine. That's the only machine that actually works. Check out that number. Holy crap. That's my chest is on fire. Oh, my gosh. It must be really hot in here because your face is super red. I don't want to lose to you. I thought of 1600. Okay, he did actually need to do that. If he was legit, he'd have to be. He's totally fine. I know. He's not allowed to be in the room. Oh, no, Kevin. What's the truth for XJ? All right. So we are today having a ClickFunnels Boise office party. And so Klaesman killed himself getting the whole everything ready. And Melanie and everybody, how many people are coming to the party today? 120 people. So you guys excited for this? Are you guys stressed out or how's it all feeling? This is not fun. It can be worse. It's only 120 people, not 65, 500. Sorry, buddy. What's up, buddy? How you doing? What's up, guys? How are you? Get closer. Get closer. I love it. Oh, yeah, there it is. And you have a luau. You have to have a pig. And it's the most exciting part of the entire night because you got a pig on a spit. I'm getting a pig out. I want to say a massive thank you to our whole ClickFunnels family here in the Boise area and all of everyone who traveled in. We're so appreciative for each one of you guys who help us at our company, but most of all for your families who support you guys and support us. So huge applause for your families. We appreciate that so much. Thank you, everyone. What's up? I'm Max. Turn it up. I'm not a kid. Come on, come on, come on. You ready for some action? Turn it up. Turn it up. Turn it up. Turn it up.
