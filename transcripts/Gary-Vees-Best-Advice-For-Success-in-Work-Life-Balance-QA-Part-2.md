I Hope that's alright. Anyway, that said you guys enjoy part two of the Gary V show guys Nobody remembers the part where Michael Jordan couldn't get to the finals because the pistons were beating him every single time Are they Thomas, you know what I mean guys, let me really unleash you doing more nobody remembers the losses As long as you have a win Is there any trends that you see or platforms or any advice that you see with women entrepreneurs primarily my age 30s 40s. Yeah, so the thing, you know, it's funny Katie, right? Hey Hi Katie said the most important part I've become Unbelievably fascinated and empathetic about the difference between men and women, you know, I'm super fascinated by it from a business standpoint That's my lens to the world. It's harder To be 100% yourself when you're a woman than a man I genuinely believe that because men are dick faces, right? And so the answer to your question is to be 100% radically transparently You I'm also massively empathetic how that's difficult for everybody, especially Attractive women. How do you how do you balance work and family? How do you do it? By first and foremost not adhering to the current state of political correctness that everybody here is deployed on me most of all right and Second extremism I almost took the whole entire month of August off Like I go all in right I go when I'm in this like Monday through Friday. I do not see my kids pretty much at all 39 weeks of the 52 weeks in a year just what it is and then on weekends and You know seven weeks eight weeks of vacation a year. I'm all in the other way. That's how I do it for me But that is only uniquely gonna work if me and my partner in crime are aligned on that strategy Audit that strategy every day by the way, I don't even want to do it anymore as now they're eight and five and not five and two They're just more interesting to be around, you know so So like for example, I guarantee you in 24 more months this exact trip They're here and we go to you know, we go and see the Grand Canyon or something You know so like like you know, I I'm so sad that so many people do certain things in parenting because that's what the other parents think they should be doing like I Don't know like I just want to make a very important statement that I implore every parent in this room understands Everything that is right in parenting right now by the common standards will not be in 20 years You're gonna be judged one way or the other When you grow rapidly, how do you embed the culture to make sure that it grows with the right people, right? So we built values manifestos ready. Yeah How do you get? muscles by doing push-ups You do it consistently every day. I Spend an ungodly amount of my time on HR Like now I have 800 employees next year. I'm gonna mandate That I see every one of my employees every six months for 15 minutes, which is gonna eat up Big amounts of time. So literally you're taking that one. I When I do the one-on-one time it always works, but I'm just thinking now from a scaled standpoint like how the heck scaling the unscalable is How you build long-term wealth? That's good one. Thanks, bro I think I didn't get up here for my house Now we know why you got panty stand up there Second my second question was okay as you grow obviously have things you get you've got haters, right? I'm sure that people don't like you and whatever sure So I always focus on the mission and the vision and the people that were helping right? But when you get like certain people, I mean still affects like me like when I get this stuff So how do you overcome that so you can keep growing? empathy For them. Yes, and like just for their life circumstances or sure If a human being can generate hate They're not in a good place Okay So what do you do? Mentally and mindset to just keep going I deploy gratitude that are not them I feel like an entrepreneur on accident honestly Okay, and the thing that I love to do is is the business that I do that's making you money But recently I've started being like way more vulnerable about the whole chip on the shoulder thing and like And telling my story and that's resonating with a lot of people But that's hard like I hate doing that like I'm very introverted I don't like being out there that much, but that's what seems to be making the biggest impact. I'm pretty news What's binary? Either you do more of it and you get used to it and like everything in life once you get used to it It just becomes your norm and you didn't realize it now You may never be the most extroverted, but you just expect it Everybody here can be a better singer dancer and basketball player They may not become LeBron, but if you do it every day you get better You keep putting yourself out there every day you'll get better so you can either choose to do that Or you could say I don't like it I'll leave the money on the table because I love the privacy and the private life and not having to engage and you do that It's your choice. You're in charge Are you an advocate for doing like what's harder though? I'm an advocate on doing on doing what you want to do Not because I said so or your friend said so It's I'm an advocate of you doing what you want to be doing, but I always encourage to taste more Because it works. You mean people here Do you know how many people here hate oysters, but have never had one? I think about that every day That's I think about business Like you've made a judgment on something yet. You've never done it I already know you're gonna do more of it because you've already done the hardest part, which is you've done it Just really quickly. Is there anything that is hard for you? Like I know that I like No, like your mindset the way that you think about things you're like, I'm confident I can do this But like is it hard yes get up in the morning sometimes no is anything no part at all Spelling is impossible. I Can't read for If I was reading from a teleprompter right now, I would crumble and be out of here can't read for like, you know fencing probably is Hard oh I'm really way below average and swimming poor swimmer like always think like I'll be super pissed if I like That's how if I die because we get like somebody hits a and I have to swim further than everybody and like like Yeah, you're asking me that as somebody who knows a lot about me Because I don't spend any time on it We all suck at So like I don't care how you judge mine you've got to so because I don't care about that I'm not the only reason people spend time on their weaknesses is because it's everybody else's opinion on it that they're trying to avoid I don't care about your opinion about my weakness because I know you've got them too. So let's just move on Oh
