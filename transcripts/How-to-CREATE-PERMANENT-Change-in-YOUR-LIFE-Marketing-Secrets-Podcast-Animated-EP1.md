## Transcript
Welcome back to the Marketing Seekers podcast. I'm not gonna lie. Today came in and I was just frustrated at a lot of things. I was like, you know what I need? I need a new view of the world. One of my first mentors, Matt Fury, when I was getting into this game, I started studying exhaled under marketing and then, you know, lo and behold, he was sneaky and started slipping in all his personal development stuff, which was so good for me. I'm probably gonna say this wrong. This is back on an old CD that I bought from him way back in the day. So this is like, I couldn't even re-find this if I wanted to. And I remember talking about, like, you know, any room, there's an energy, right? There's energy in the room. It's like, if you want to change the energy, change the room, right? Like, if you're not feeling the vibe you want or the energy you need to be able to produce or to work or to think or whatever, it's like, literally, just change your desk. Like, move a plan. Like, it physically changes the energy of the room. Like, move a picture, move your monitor, move your desk. Like, just shift things up. I just change things and it'll change the energy of the room and how you produce it and how you do everything. So he, in the Willpower Doesn't Work, he talked about how, like, you know, look at how people change things in life. They try to change, you know, quit smoking, start making money, all these things, right? They have willpower. If I just do these things for 30 days, it's okay to happen or whatever. They're trying to, like, force things through willpower. And I remember the premise of the book doesn't matter. It's basically, it doesn't matter how much willpower you had. You always would relapse back. And so the only thing that caused sustainable change in people over time was, can you guess, a change of environment. You change the environment, which then makes the habits all easy, right? And that was the secret, right? Like literally moving, physically shifting your body or your environment, like changing things around you. And so, I mean, that could be used at a big scale where you're like, I'm going to move to a different city. Like that's going to change things, right? If you're around bad group people and it's easy to fall into your bad house, if you literally physically move to some other state or different place, that could cause the shift in the energy that you need to make the change, right? Or if you're, you know, like me sitting in an office where you just, like, need something, like physically shifting things will change the environment, which now makes it easier to have willpower and, you know, have the things you need to be able to be successful. I'm hoping for me to just have more energy. I've tried it for the last, like, four days to get this project done. I keep coming in and I just can't get it done. I'm like, I think it's because I'm just stuck in this rut of, you know, that I'm just not happy. I'm like, I need to shift everything. And so, I literally came in and I started ripping things off my desk, moving monitors, shifting things around, moving my computers, moving my desk, like just getting a whole new perspective on the world. And I'm about halfway through it now. My whole office is in nightmare. It was really clean a few minutes ago, but now it's a nightmare. So, what do you think about it for yourself right now? Coming back to us, talking about the fours, for you to start thinking about, like, in your personal life, in your business, in your work environment, in your family, in your house, in your, right, wherever. Like, if things are stuck or stagnant, can you just, like, radically shift things around? Like, what would happen if you did that? Like, what would it look like? Like, what would you change? What would you move? And what would be the outcome you're hoping for, right? I'm hoping for me to just have more energy. I've tried it for the last, like, four days to get this project done. I keep coming in and I just can't get it done. I'm like, I think it's because I'm just stuck in this rut of, you know, that I'm just not happy. I'm like, I need to shift everything. So let me shift everything. And now, well, I'll find out on the later on today, if I'm able to, like, be in a state where I can get work done, the energy's different, the feeling's different, now I can start running. And so that's kind of my game plan.
