So I have a special question today from our favorite network marketers, is how do I use funnels to get network marketing to work? Okay, so there's a lot of different ways I can answer this, but for some reason, people think that their business is different. Always think it gets like, oh cool, Russell, I read the dot com secrets book, but how does it work for my business? I read expert secrets, how does it work for my business? I don't care what business you're in, business is business is all the same, okay? The difference in network marketing really is like you're competing, you're selling the exact same product as a thousand other people, right? So the first step is like expert secrets 101, is how do you create an offer, right? Because if I'm competing with a thousand or 10,000 or 100,000 or a million other distributors, I need to create an offer that's sexy, it's unique, right? Business is all about making better offers. So how do I create an offer that's actually selling my product better than everybody else's, okay? And some network marketing companies all problems with this, so this is one that if you're able to crank up the sexiness of your offer, do it, some companies don't allow it, so you gotta be kind of careful with that. But if everyone else is offering this, how do I offer something different? Those who don't know my background, I spent a couple of years dabbling in the network marketing industry and there was a time when one company was giving away a Ferrari and I was like, I'd be really cool to win a Ferrari, so I decided to win a Ferrari. And so how do I do that? Step number one, I looked at me and a hundred thousand other distributors all selling the exact same products. I said, okay, I have to make a better offer. So I took what everybody was selling, I said, okay, everyone's selling this, how do I make this better? I was like, cool, well if you join me, I'm gonna give you, everyone else is gonna give me, but I'm also gonna give you this, and I'm gonna give you this, I'm gonna give you this, and I created a package with special just people who signed up with me, that pushed them over the edge. There's a lot of people who are like, ah, these people are on the fence, they're not gonna sign up with anybody, I got them to join me, and because I made a better offer. So that's number one, okay? And then I won a Ferrari, so that was awesome. So that's step number one, okay? Number two, is a lot of network marketing companies aren't gonna allow you to just directly sell online. It's a thing a lot of them have. So what we do is we go back to the fundamentals, to the basics, okay? So, and it comes back really to expert secrets, okay? And we see this all the time too, recently, a very well-known company, I was friends, I'm friends with the owners, just went under, and what's interesting is a lot of people lost their businesses overnight, right? But the people who didn't were the people who followed this process, is they realized that like, if you just send all your people to the company, right? Then the company owns all these people. The most valuable asset in any business is the people. So you gotta be in the business of you first. So all you do is I create a very simple landing page, and it's gonna be like, in fact, depending on what I'm doing, usually I make two different landing pages. The big thing about network marketing is, that's different than in traditional business, so there's two target markets. Two target markets, okay? So first target market is the person who actually wants to consume the product, okay? So a lot of network marketing products are for health. So there's like, the product consumers, consumers, and then there's the business opportunity seekers, right? What's interesting is a lot of times, people join a company because they're obsessed with product. Other times people join the opportunity because they're obsessed with the actual opportunity. And it's rare that people love both initially, usually like one or the other drives them, right? So for me, I build a different landing page and different funnel for each one. So I'd have something here like, hey, if you wanna discover how is it, we'll quit my part-time job and I want a sweet pink, what is it, what's the pink Cadillac? Then opt in here and I'll tell you how, right? So now when we get people who like, they quit their job and you got a pink Cadillac, that's awesome. And so they're gonna opt in because they wanna find out more about the business opportunity, right? Or I could be like, for people who wanna buy the product, I could be like, what's the product? This product helps people with whatever. So it could be like, hey, discover the rare salts that instantly within 30 minutes of taking them, we'll put your body into ketosis so you can lose weight faster. And they're like, what are these weird salts? And they'd opt in here and now they're about the product, right? So they'd opt in here about the product. So then they're joining my email list, okay? So both these things are joining my list. Now I build a list of people who they like me. I'm gonna take them here, I'm gonna show them videos, where I tell them stories, I'm gonna build relationships about the product or about the thing. And then basically somewhere along the line, I invite them to take my special offer. So back here, again, if it's like, hey, here's that one, my pink Cadillac, and lost a bunch, wait, they opt in. Next page is like, cool, I did it by joining this company. It's awesome, this is how it works. If you wanna be part of it, you can join my team and I'm gonna make you a special offer. If you join today, you're gonna get, you're gonna join, but I'm also gonna let you be part of my private Facebook group. I'm gonna wanna coach them with you. I'll do three-way calls with you, I'll do blah, blah, whatever it is your offer is, and they sign up. And then come over to Facebook and I drive Facebook ads to my option page. And people are like, but Facebook doesn't allow you to drive people into your business opportunity, right? Well, they don't let me drive people to my company website. Yeah, of course they don't. You drive them into your funnel. Okay, Facebook's not gonna show you down because you're showing a free video about how you wanna peen Cadillac. That's what Facebook wants, stuff like that, okay? Facebook's not gonna show you down when you say like, here's rare ancient salt that helps you put your body in ketosis. That's what Facebook wants, the stuff like that. They come, they opt in, then maybe there's a video and then the email sequence, you email them over here, right? So a lot of the stuff that Facebook and other platforms allow you to do, happen off the platform, okay? But the key to this, and all businesses, in case you're actually wondering, is the funnel. Instead of this, it's going back, setting up a funnel, building a relationship with the list as they come through, right? So Dotcom Secrets is a book all about how do you create the funnels, funnel structure, funnel strategy, right? So you build the funnels and then it's like, how do I build a relationship with all of these people coming through the funnel so that when I tell them they should buy this thing, they actually buy it? That's what extra secrets about it is, build the relationships, telling the stories, positioning yourself in the right way so that when you do make them a special offer, they go crazy and they give you money, okay? And so we got tons of network marketers in ClickFunnels who were killing it and they're basically building really simple funnels to build, to build lists based on one or two things. Number one is they're building lists of people who potentially are gonna buy the product, they're building lists of people who are interested in the business opportunity and they're speaking to these two different lists differently but they're making them pretty much the same offer in the back and that is how I would do it again if I was to go and try to win another Ferrari, inside a network marketing company. So there you go. Thank you so much for watching. Every single week we publish new secrets just like this so make sure you subscribe so you don't miss any of them and I will see you on the next video.
