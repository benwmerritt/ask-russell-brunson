I mean normally I don't need a reason to celebrate with a bottle of bubbly and a blow-up unicorn, but We did have something exciting happen yesterday at 4 12 a.m. In the morning and no dirty-minded people it wasn't that It was awake at 4 12 because I got a message on voxer at 4 12 a.m. Which is kind of creepy Which is 2 a.m. Your time. So you were just going to bed so We yesterday Russell and I hit The 10 million dollar mark for funnel scripts What dude you're not going to open that near your computer. Are you because I don't drink so I don't know how this works Uh-oh by fake water champagne. Do not hold that near the computer. There's not a cork on this So don't does the same impact to try it I can't a pop whatever shake it up. We're all going to open these things together There's only about a hundred grand worth of electronic equipment in that office. Go ahead All right, I'm kind of nervous. So I'm gonna go my garbage can out. Okay, so we're also bringing phones just past 10 million dollars this week in sales Yay All right, I'm ready My water exploded. Whoo. Yay. I don't like fizzy water. I'm gonna drink anyway. I don't know. There you go. All right. This is how this is like my Oh my god Water's the worst Yay, congratulations everybody Congratulations and thank you to everybody. It was a team effort. Absolutely a team effort Ever supported funnel scripts over the last few years. It's good now I want to talk about something that um, a lot of people didn't know but you guys may notice how clean shaven and beautiful gym looks today So when did this whole bet sir? I can't even write When it's always like 14 months ago on a funnel Friday's like hey, dude I know you're trying to get the 10 million dollar award and I was like, yeah, he said well, um, hey, you're gonna Not shaving that beard till you get there, huh? And I was like, yeah. Yeah, that's great. Yeah We can do it and and in the spirit of funnel fridays. Yeah, and then and then I'm like, I'm gonna have to grow a cat on my face Which he did you guys all see that I flipped over to the uh the facebook live yesterday. Are you cutting it? um Yep. All right, here it is. You guys can see what happened yesterday after after we passed the 10 million dollar mark We're about to witness the trimming of the 10 million dollar beard So here's the story About a year ago, russell brunson said to me. Hey, man You're gonna not cut that beard until you hit the 10 million dollar mark with funnel scripts And in the moment he asked me this on funnel uh funnel fridays I was like, yeah, man Sure, we'll do it and then after I said it. I was like, dang. I'm not gonna be able to shave this muskrat For a while. So we've been busting butt to get it over the 10 million dollar mark um, we got it over the 10 million dollar mark so I'm going to trim this thing because i'm tired of having this big hobo beard on my face and so Here we go ah I could get a second job shearing sheep My wife's laughing at me trying to you know, you missed a spot Oh Man, I'm so glad we captured this for forever. There you go. Yeah Here you go, so there it is. Oh, there you go. So anyway, I don't know All right, so that's So at real quick everybody's listening there's a couple lessons that help everybody learn from this experiment So number one is a lot of people like I want to make a million dollars I'll make 10 million dollars and then they let themselves off the hook Jim was like, all right I'm gonna say something that's gonna annoy me every single day and be itchy and long and curly until I hit the goal And then he went out there. He's like, I gotta hit this goal So that's number one like if you guys are all comfortable because you're not hitting your goals Like make something uncomfortable like to put yourself in pain. So you have to go and do it Number two, have you noticed that we didn't like launch funnel scripts and then just like sit back for the last four years waiting For people to buy it It has been an intense labor love Jim has consistently been increasing the value adding more scripts adding more things doing more things Doing more trainings like always increasing the values of the price of funnel scripts seems cheaper and cheaper and cheaper and cheaper And then we consistently talk about it, right? How many funnel fridays is this this episode? Like what are we at right? A lot seven to year Like we've been consistently talking about it weekend and week out and weekend and week out I think a lot of people they put the thing up and they're like, I'm gonna be rich and then they just sit in their weight And then they never happen. So there's a lot of lessons you learn can I add one more thing to the lesson? Yes, you you got to have a vision for what you're doing And that vision is going to help to sustain you when other people either don't have the vision or other people Can't catch the vision or you're the only one that believes that it's going to work I'm not saying that's what the situation was but you got to have a vision the stronger the vision the bigger the vision the um The more you can do and it without a vision and there's somewhere in the bible. It says without a vision the people perish um, and There you go So thank you russel and team because it it would not have happened without you Our grateful v-man this has been your vision from day one We first messed and you're like this is gonna be huge and then you're the one that put in the effort and the work to continue to do it So grateful v-man you've been an amazing partner and it's just fun to celebrate with you. It's awesome bubbly water. Whoo. There you go and my fake So on top of top of celebrating today with you guys. We also wanted to um have some fun because uh Today we are we are in the process I make sure I'm recording this. All right. There we go. Um We're we're gonna do a fun fun Friday stay and uh, we've got a new script for demo I believe we've got some other cool stuff and I'm I'm pumped for it So you want to kind of talk about what the plan is for today? Sure So one of the things that we've been talking about and it's really resonating with people are bridge pages And we did a training over in the avengers group where if you're not in the avengers group You should be in the avengers group because there's some amazing stuff going on over there and um, if you youtube, uh search Cliffholtz avengers that should pop up our affiliate training group Absolutely, and so Talking about bridge pages There are all kinds of different ways you can use bridge pages and we were showing how to use funnel scripts to create bridge pages and One of the things we told people was You can do a demo and I've always kind of taken things for granted About doing a demo because I've done thousands of demos over the years and then Something interesting happened. This is like gonna be a combination epiphany bridge story So the funny thing happened was in the in the help desk. We got a question somebody had Join funnel scripts and had bought Russell's network marketing secrets book and they asked me All people should do by the way Everybody should have this book and I'll tell you why so They were asking, you know, which funnel script should they use for which um, the funnels that Russell talks about in there And I was able to answer it pretty quickly. But then I said Russell's got a network marketing secrets book I haven't read this book. Can I get a copy of the book? Sure, Jim? You can have a copy of the book They sent me copy of the book and on page 39 I read something that Changed my life forever. It's actually on page 40, but it starts on page 39 and it's Russell talking about Um, the demo doing a demonstration in this case of whatever product the network marketing company selling And I was like, yeah, that makes sense. Oh my god and there was this one thing in here that um He teaches the formula and this one thing right here eliminate the alternatives I might my forehead was literally getting flat And I think my beard got three inches longer because I was pulling on going. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. This is it This was the missing thing And so I tried it out Uh with with a couple different demos and you know, I've always gotten really good results But then when I did this it was like boom through the roof people were responding. I would you know the the It was like doubling the response I was getting And I said there's something here and I need to do this consistently and the best way to do this is to create a script So that's what we did. We created a script. We unveiled it this week on the funnel scripts training for everybody And I since on tuesday when we unveiled it. I have overhauled the script again to make it even cooler And so what I thought we'd do Is Russell real quick explain everybody what a bridge page is and what the purpose is of a bridge page Why you would use it and then we'll explain why this is so important And so helpful Well, Jim, I'm glad you asked because uh Fridge pages are one of the coolest tools and most misunderstood tools in the internet world. So There are times and places when You want to sell something over here? And maybe you don't own this website So you are an affiliate for this thing or it's a network marketing opportunity This is the company corporate website or something in like you have no control over this this page And so the only thing you have control in is the pre frame that somebody enters into this page with so you go back back here You have something that we call a bridge page A bridge page and so bridge page you drive traffic because a lot of times if you drive traffic directly to this page The hits and this bounces off because the page doesn't convert well or there's a thousand affiliates all put on the same page or There can be a million different different reasons why just driving traffic directly here doesn't work Um, something advertised networks won't even let you do that directly through your affiliate like um And so the bridge page is basically um, it's it's the thing in between Between your traffic and the thing you're trying to sell. So for example, let's say I'm walking up on the street And I see somebody I could just let's say I say I'm you know that book network marketing secrets is a network marketing book Right, so let's say I'm a network marketing company. I am selling This fancy pants bubbly water, right? I can walk up to like somebody on the street bank. Here's the order for them to buy the water And then like wait, what is it? I can see order for my son if you want bubbly water, it's really good Like the likelihood of buying is not very good, right? That's the equivalent of sending somebody directly here The bridge page me kind of like hey, I gotta tell you a story. This is why this water is amazing This is what I like about this why it's all like you telling your own story. You're doing a product demo He's also a taster. Oh, it just tastes so good. And this is amazing You do your product demo and like do you like this stuff cool go over here to go buy it and then you push somebody from there to To the thing over here. So bridge page Traditionally is me or whoever doing some kind of demo We call it in the network marketing secrets book I call it the billy maize demo because if you guys remember billy maize, he was like the oxy clean dude He was probably in the greatest pitch spent of all time He passed away a couple years ago and I toy geeked out after he died and right him and his pitches I watched like literally every infomercial I could find of his and like the billy maize strips is based on like Here's all the things billy did every single of his infomercial mini It is they're always like a little micro infomercial like the the 30 seconds to two minute infomercials Um, and so that's what the script space sounds like demoing the product bridge the gap between where they're at And then the thing you're actually gonna sell that makes sense Yeah, that's awesome as far as the structure for a bridge page Typically though with the the bridge page is as simple as a headline a video and a link That's it that and the more you add actually the the less it will convert And the cool thing with bridge pages is you can use them for affiliate offers You can use them for your own offers when you're literally just bridging page old people from From one mindset over to where you ultimately want to make make them go It's the thing that preframes them and and explains what's going on so they understand what's happening so one of the most Effective things you can do for a bridge page is a A demonstration a demonstration of a product the demonstration of a physical product of a piece of software Some of the most profitable things I have ever done in my life online have been simple bridge page demonstrations of other people's software Hey guys, Jim Edwards here found this really cool tool for you that's going to help you do x y and z Let me show you how it works Hey, you just do this this this and this and it's gonna it does this all you gotta do is just exactly what I showed you And hey, if you buy through my link, I'll give you this and this so click the link down below and then send me an email With your receipt and I'll give you the bonus Oh Boom Yes, so simple So the thing is that people think oh, well, that's you know, I'm not selling a piece of software Jim That's right. So what I want to do is show you guys the um I'm going to show you the script and then we're going to make a bridge page demonstrating Russell's book and we're going to make the bridge page instead of funnel scripts And or well, we're going to make the script. We're going to use the script inside of funnel scripts and Russell's going to make the actual um bridge page inside of click funnels and it's going to take like less than 10 minutes so I'll just work on zoom because I see Like on we did on youtube before we go back and forth our screens zooms, right? So what what I would suggest we do on zoom is let me demo Won't you you set up set up a basic bridge page show them? Yeah, I'm sorry. I just get it ready with a um headline Where we'll put in the video and then a call to action the call to action is going to be get your free book Okay, so real quick. I'll do bridge page funnel funnel Friday's I've been doing that for like 60 something episodes and no one else does it I did it after you did it I keep trying to get Todd to build in the soft force. I don't even click a button. It does that But you might do it. So that's Okay, so I'm just gonna pick You just use a blank page Where's I think we have a do we have a button? This is blank page. Oh we used to Do you have a blank page template? I I literally thought we had what I told you before I need a blank page templates I hate using templates, but That's just me All right Okay, like the bridge pages. This is like literally a 30 second project if you spend more on that you fail Yep, so simple. Do you have a headline for me at all yet or let me just uh? Um, I will have a headline for you in just a minute But I want I want to show them how the script works real quick and won't take long video So video and call to action. That's it So I'm basically ready. I'm just gonna delete everything else. Okay I make this button bigger because I like big buttons Big I like big buttons and I will not lie You other brothers kids Are we um wrapping today? When a button walks in with a big button in your with big text in your face you get clicked Okay The longest part of this template is deleting all the other stuff boom All right, cool. So now what I what I need you to do is to stop sharing your screen so I can share my screen Back to you Jim. Okay, cool. So what I'm going to show you guys here real quick is the new I call the demo script and uh, this follows the the The format that russell teaches that he he got from the billy mace thing And it basically you demo the product you show him how it's faster and easier you eliminate the alternatives Intro the price get urgency and scarcity do the risk reversal all the time in there using your call to action So what I did was I it took me like 10 minutes to type this up And so what's and and we have a couple of cool examples in here We have one for funnel scripts with two software We have one that we did on tuesday in the live training for a camera bag really was cool And um, so this one that I wanted to show you could do it with just a book So what's the name of the product service or demonstrating network marketing secrets? What is it? What's the biggest benefit the biggest pain this eliminates? What's the big payoff? What's the alternative most people? Think of when they try to do this then what are all the things that you want to show about the product? So step by step. What do you want to show in this case? I listed off um each page where it had something cool and then What's all the stuff they don't need to do anymore? So this is eliminating the alternatives Then what's the price? What's an alternative way to express the price how fast can they see results? Why should they grab it now? What's your risk reversal and what you call it to action? So now It actually puts all the pieces together with your hook intro faster and easier demo eliminate the alternatives intro price urgency scarcity risk reversal and then I downloaded the script as a word document And I got all high tech and printed it off Okay and then I Printed it off and I literally as you're gonna see here in a minute. Okay rather me I held my phone I held my phone in my right hand quite clumsily as though I had some sort of a palsy And then I held the um, I held this printed off In my other hand and I read it As you will see I tried to do it with the least amount of Pinnache as possible And so I actually recorded it and I'm gonna send you Russell in the facebook I'm gonna send you the link to the video so you can pop it in there and people can But I mean The sound sucks. It's done like, you know, somebody would do it if they were just giving it a half An effort and You can see that this thing takes It can take anything and create a really really really cool demo And the cool thing is is that you don't have to sit around and wait You don't have to Struggle to not get all the right pieces in there You don't have to pay somebody hundreds or thousands of dollars to write you a script And you don't and the biggest thing is you don't have to waste two three four five hours trying to figure it out And you don't have to wait a couple weeks for somebody to get it back to you You just did this on your phone. I did this on my phone like literally right before we got Um You were in the same shirt, so we got it right five seconds ago Um, yeah, and the only reason I didn't do it live was because I it was I couldn't transfer it from my phone fast enough All right is live so watch this Why don't I get the audio to work because you got a when you share your screen make here unshare your screen real quick Yeah, and then when you go to share your screen before you do it, there'll be a little box that you can click that says share computer audio Look at that. Jim's teaching me how to use zoom. I love it. Do that and that should play All right Let me refresh the page To share your computer audio, please install the zoom audio device. Are you kidding me? Oh Sorry Know what that means it works Okay We refresh this page. Sorry friends for our technical difficulties. Good thing we're using You want me to you want me to play it from my side back to you Jim Let me say here. I'm seeing the links of the the page and you can okay All right, it's back to you. I'm gonna unshare this so you can start resharing it unshare All right, and I know hey one let one thing before and I'll show you this Um one thing if you're looking for the perfect headline In the in this where it has the hook What if you could easily find the right people to join your m&m team without suffering rejection from family and friends? Your headline is how to easily find the right people to join your m&m team without suffering rejection from family and friends That's your headline For the um for the page. Okay. I'll put it plug it into the page. Okay. Yeah, let me Okay, you'll have to fix the stuff and put a how to on it, but um, okay There you go. Do you want me to wait till you do that? Um give me 15 seconds. I'll have it. Okay Okay But I mean the the thing is while I was doing this guys I mean I wanted to do this not as not perfectly so you could see even not doing it perfectly It's passable. It's doable, especially if you were to I mean, here's the other thing a bridge page The more it looks Like it's a real person teaching something the better you'll do In the past when I've done stuff where it's like, you know, the phone's ringing and the kid opens the door and And other stuff those typically will do better than the ones that look super polished and they're the most their best lit And other things like that there's a time and a place for that But for a bridge page like this where where you're just demoing something and showing people how to get a result You know just make keeping it real keeps it real And you'll get better results So that's one thing I did want to show you guys and that that just just taking that hook right there And turn them into your headline. That's like cheating. Okay. My page is done. You refresh that it is ready to rock and roll Okay The bridge page ninja. Sweet how to easily find the right people to join your mlm team without suffering injection from family in front Dude, that's that's mint. Whoo. We can't see it I'll see we see your uh demo scripts. What's on the screen? Are you're not seeing it? Okay, let me stop sharing that's weird because I was seeing it but Oh weird it shows on the Okay, that's all right. I'm not buying stock and zoom anytime soon. Okay. So are you seeing it now? There we go. Boom. Okay Play why is it not playing? Maybe Maybe let's go directly to the youtube page and just watch. Okay. Well here it is on the youtube page ready Hey guys, jim Edwards here with a brand new book. I want to tell you all about what if you could easily find the right people To join your mlm team without suffering from rejection from family and friends. Well now you can Introducing network marketing secrets and network marketing secrets is a revolutionary new book That makes it easy and fast to find the right people who are super interested in what you're selling And they're actually going to raise their hands and ask you to sign them up And this is so much faster and easier than having to badger your friends and family until you've alienated basically Everybody you know and everybody they know as well So let me show you why network marketing secrets is so amazing. First of all on page 18 Russell explains to you the lost funnel And the lost funnel is basically the way that you can Leverage somebody else's expertise in order to get people to sign up Even if you don't know that much about the mlm that you are with right now. So the cool thing is you don't need to worry about basically talking to people that aren't interested in what you're selling and you don't have to be a total expert yet to be able to do it The second thing that this does for you over on page 20 is it shows you how you can Be a big time recruiter even if you barely understand what your company is selling So the cool thing that means it does not going to take you months and weeks and years to build up to this You can leverage this to get results super super fast The other thing that teaches you over on page 26 Is how you can differentiate between the people who are interested in buying your product versus the people who are interested in your opportunity And how you can automatically Recruit both which means you don't have to struggle with either recruiting or product sales You can do both and do really really well with it also over here on page 60 They're going to show you how to take the proven home party. Oh man. I'm so excited. I can barely hang on to my phone um, they're going to show you how to take the proven home party formula and apply it online So that you can use the power of group sales, but you don't have to go anywhere That means no more heading over to hotels It means no more trying to get people to agree to meet with you in your homes You don't have to worry about traveling anywhere. You just make sales and then also on page 66 This must this may be the greatest thing ever They're going to show you how to duplicate this entire process In your own MLM business so that you not only can do it But then you can take these proven things that they're going to teach you to do in this book And you're going to be able to help your team Do those as well so it creates a giant organization of sales Which means you never have to worry about how your people are going to be able to duplicate your success Now the great thing about this if that wasn't the only thing that was amazing Is this book is absolutely free All you have to do is just cover a small shipping charge And the shipping charge is less than the cost of a trip to starbucks So you want to grab this now because this book holds the key To you joining the elite ranks of your company's top leadership And being a rising star in whatever organization you're in because it doesn't matter what you're selling Physical product services doesn't matter. This book is going to help you do it. And by the way, I think they're crazy for this But if you don't like the book You don't even have to send it back and they'll refund the shipping. So go ahead act now Claim your free copy while supplies last. I'll see you guys soon Okay, just demoed a book right and I mean, I just demoed a book and it wasn't the it wasn't the greatest demo in the world, but but That was without even practicing it That was without practicing That's what's withholding the thing I imagine if I'd have put the phone on a tripod or had somebody else with steady hands hold it If I'd have practiced the script two or three times Which would have taken a total of 12 minutes to practice it three times and then just delivered it Amped up my my excitement level And all of a sudden you're doing Demo after demo after demo and you're hitting all the right buttons and It's I mean you guys can tell us in the comments down below whether you thought that was any good or not for a first try with absolutely no rehearsal whatsoever, but It I'm telling you this script can change your life and using bridge pages is a way for you to use clicks funnels to build a business So freaking fast and without even doing it with your own products I mean if I was going to do this I would I would do I would do this That's exactly what I would do I would take and I would do demos of russell's books Then I would do demos of all the different cool features inside of click funnels And after every single one of those videos I would direct everybody to sign up for the 14 day trial for click funnels And then I would go out on to social media And I would look for where people were asking questions that click funnels could be the solution for them And I would start answering questions by either answering them right there Or I would I would direct them to the videos that you had showing people how to um, you know, how to use click funnels to solve their problems It's it's just it's the simplest way to be able to use click funnels and to use funnel scripts to be able to create Things that will turn into money quickly So I tell a little secret that uh, Mr. Steven Larson did because he did this process right after he stopped working click funnels He went home and then he's like, okay um, he built the like a squeeze page get people's email addresses and was like get access to all the tools I used to build my business and he had like 90 different tools like click funnels and google docs and all this stuff, right? And um and like half of me had affiliate links for and he made a demo video for each one like here's how I use this Here's how I use Trello Here's how I just like did all these things and some ops in you can think of email every day of like Here's the next tweet the next tool the next tool and he makes commissions off of off of my stuff other people's stuff And just that's what he did literally just demoed all the stuff He he uses to run his business and made ton of money So for any of you guys in any market you're in like let's say you're in the stock trading market Like what are the tools you use to trade stocks going like most and probably have some type of affiliate program going create them all Demos on all of them boom that can be your whole your hope is anyway Yep, this is like you have to keep on giving the strategy the script and this bridge page concept so simple so easy Exactly and think about it. Well all the different things that you've ever bought that were from a demonstration Everything from a ginsu knife to I bought a 1500 shrink wrapper off of a 45 second video that showed Lift the thing up throw it in slam it down. It comes out shrink wrap to said yep. I'll take it I mean it's think about that and I think it's it's one of those simple things that Absolutely can change your life and think about your own products How if you did demos for different different groups and different solutions that just doing demos for your own stuff and creating bridge pages to your own stuff Hey, Jim, do you think people rise that um all 60 whatever episodes of funnel fridays is literally you demoing demoing funnel scripts and you demoing click funnels And we just passed $10 million yesterday.
