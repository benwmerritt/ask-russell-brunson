Ladyboss, you're probably wondering what in the world happened, right? You know they had over 700,000 customers who bought Ladyboss Lean. They just ran huge events with thousands of women coming to lose weight working out with Katelyn. You also see in the community where literally there's hundreds of thousands of women who wear the Ladyboss swag, who wave the flag. Why in the world did Katelyn Poland, who built Ladyboss from the ground, becoming the number one fastest consumer product brand in the world? Sell her company to a dude. We're gonna find out in today's episode. I'm gonna show everything, why it happened, where we're going, and why in the world I got so much of this protein everywhere. You're listening to Marketing Secrets with your host, Russell Brunson. Surprise! I bought Ladyboss. I know, I know, I'm not a lady or a boss, but there's a really good story behind it. So that's what we're gonna talk about in today's episode. Okay, so I want to tell you guys the story behind the story because there are so many rumors going about and I can't even like address them all because they're all over the place. But yes, I did buy Ladyboss last year and we are moments away from a relaunch. And this episode is more to kind of tell you guys behind the scenes, but some of you guys may want to be involved in Ladyboss. And so if you're interested, there is a virtual event coming up. It's called the Phoenix Rise Up Event because basically it's the rebirth of this company or relaunching it. And if you are someone who's like, I want to be part of that, you'll know more about the model here in a little bit. But if you do, if you are interested, if you go to MarketingSecrets.com slash Ladyboss, it'll take you to the registration page. You can register, be on the live event where we kind of do the big behind the scenes announcement. You guys are gonna get some of the hints before anybody else. And so keep it kind of on the down low because during this virtual event is when we're gonna kind of announce what's actually happening to the Ladyboss community, which will be fun. But I want to give you guys a heads up because I've got so many questions coming in. I know it's feeling a little pink in here, but that's what's happening when we're wrapped in Ladyboss all the time. So let me go back in time to the very, very beginning. I think it was FHL, I think it was the second or the third FHL. I can't remember. But I was sitting around the table, surrounded by a thousand people asking a million different questions. It was really fun. And then somebody taps me on the shoulder and I look back and there's this guy with like tall, spiky hair. And he's like, Russell Brunson, you changed my life. I'm like, hey, thanks man. He's like, I gotta go. And he took off. And I was like, okay, that was random, but it's so much chaos that whatever. At that event, we obviously sold our coaching program. We also sold Inner Circle and Brandon and his wife, Kailin, both joined Inner Circle. So a month or two later, they were in Boise at our first meeting. That's the first time I had a chance to kind of meet them in person. And it was funny because he's like, did you get up the video I sent you like a year ago? And I'm like, what are you talking about? It's like, I sent you a video. Sounds to be your biggest success story. Do you ever see that? I'm like, I don't know if I did. Hey, Russell, dude, for real, we're hungry. We're young. She's a pro athlete and we don't have, you know, the $15,000 or whatever to invest, but we did spend the thousand. And like I said, in three months, we made $30,000 with your thing. And we want to make a million a month, whatever it takes. You know, we want to be mentored and be students. And so anything that you can do, anything to help us, we've already done a lot and we're grateful. So thank you. And that was kind of the very beginning of it. So I remember I found that video, I watched it and I said, this is cool. And then fast forward next three or four years, every two or three months, they would fly to Boise, Seattle for an Inner Circle meeting. We talk about things and we'd work with them on their products and their services and their branding and what they're going to do and how they're going to launch and all the stuff we do inside the Inner Circle, right? The first probably year, year and a half or so, the company wasn't called Lady Boss. Katelyn's main name was Tool, T-U-E-L-L. And the business was called Tool Time Trainer. And so she had an app and things like that, and that's what she was doing. And so that was kind of the business. And I remember at one of the Inner Circle meetings, it was actually while I was writing the Expert Seekers book. And so during Inner Circle, I'd be sharing the ideas like, this is what I'm thinking about, this is what I'm trying to do with ClickFunnels. And I'm trying to build a community. I'm building, you know, we're calling people funnel hackers. This is how we're doing it. And I was like going through the whole thing, I was talking about identity. And like we have these t-shirts to say funnel hacker. I'm like, it's interesting because the only way t-shirts work is if they're self-identified, like I am a funnel hacker. I build funnels, like something where someone's like, this is who I am. This is my identity. And I remember, I can't remember if it was Brandon or Katelyn at the time. But they were talking about that. And they were like, what do we call our people? We call them tools, we call them trainer. Like what do we do? And I could tell they were kind of frustrated because like their business at the time didn't fit into the model that we were showing people how to create a mass movement, right? Everything that's like Expert Seekers 101 now. But I was teaching that, you know, a year before the book ever came out and they were trying to figure out how to weave these things in. And then what's crazy is that, you know, Brandon Katelyn flying home and while Katelyn was in the air, she like was trying to think through these things. Also, she's like, boom, Ladyboss weight loss. That's what's called, our women are called Ladybosses. And she had this whole thing. And by the time she landed, they're voxing me and like messaging me like, Ladyboss weight loss, this is the future. This is what we're doing. They were so excited. And I was like, holy cow, you guys move so fast. And a week later, they had like the logos and the branding and all sorts of stuff and it was pink and it was all these things. And they had their mission and then they started following everything we talked about in Expert Secrets to the team. In fact, it was funny because a lot of the stories in Expert Secrets are from Katelyn. Like I would do something and then she would do the same thing. Like, and I would do something she would do the same thing and then she would make her, put her twists and her tweaks on it. It's crazy. Looking back in the ClickFunnels journey, I think my favorite years were like during that time when it was like Brandon and Katelyn and Hermoses and a couple other people who were like going through it. Like I felt like we were learning it in real time. I was testing it in my communities. They were testing it in their communities. We were reporting back and making tweaks and changes. And I felt like I was part of it. In fact, people asked me one time, like why I did my masterminds and stuff. Like, like you can just make more money doing these things. And I was like, well, I have ADD and you guys probably can see this because back in the day, pre-click funnels, I had like a thousand different businesses and like I had horrible ADDs and all of them. And then I shut them down and focus on ClickFunnels and did just ClickFunnels for like eight years, which is why it grew so big. And then now my ADDs kind of coming back out and buying companies and relaunching stuff, as you can kind of tell. But a big reason why I did it or circle for so long was because it gave me an outlet where I could be creative and not have to like launch a business. Right. Like all my inner circle members could come to Boise. I could be creative like, all this is my business. I would do this. I would do this. I would do this. I would do this. And they'd go and do it. And I could go back to work on ClickFunnels and not worry about it. Right. It's like, I love that. It was like, some of the most fun times going back and forth. And I feel like if you look at the Lady Boss business and brand, it was probably the business that encapsulated all of our core training the best. Right. If you look at Dotcom Secrets, Expert Secrets, Traffic Secrets and how they took this business and grew it from being a literal zero, you know, startup to then it becoming number four on the Inc 500 fastest growing companies, number one, fastest growing consumer product company. And so for me, it was like, I had a sense of pride. Like I was so proud of them. They're like, by star students, but also like they went out there and innovated so many things. I learned so much from them as well. And I was just super proud of what they did. And they are too. Right. So we're so proud of this whole business brand. But as you will find out, if you go to the Phoenix Rise Up event, you know, Kaylin had a baby and they said another baby and she wanted to go back and wanted to be a mom. And I think they had tried to sell the company at one point. They didn't really work out. And you know, about times when all of the algorithm changes with Facebook and iOS, all the things and unbeknownst to me, Brandon and Kaylin, they made a decision to just shut down Lady Boss. Look pulled my phone and there's an email from Kaylin saying, we're shutting Lady Boss down. And I remember reading the email. I was like, what in the world? Like, I know how much effort went into this. I know what they did. I know what they created and to shut it down. First I was nervous. I thought something might have happened. I messaged him like, he was okay. Like can I help with anything? And I was like, no, we're just, we're ready for the next chapter in our life. You know, Kaylin wanted to focus on being a mom. They'd save a ton of money from the business. Brandon, he, Brandon's like one of the best operational minds of all time. Right. He'd operationally built the infrastructure to build Lady Boss and he wanted to go and coach people on how to do that. Right. It's like, I don't want to keep running a female weight loss business. My wife's not involved. Like I want to go do these other things. And so they decided that it'd been simpler just to shut it down and kind of close it down. And so over the next few weeks and then months, if you were on the list, you probably saw they were doing blowout. So I was like selling out all the rest of Lady Boss lean and this try to like clear out the inventory and tons of emails are going out. And I was just like, man, this is such like, I don't know. Part of me is like, if like a parent or dad or whatever, like this is my baby's like, they're coming up and like, look what they created. And it's like going away. I'm like, I don't want us to go away. And I had a bunch of friends who I was like, you, like people in the female fitness space, like you should buy this company, buy this kind of like trying somebody buy this company, make them an offer. Like you guys are crazy. Not to say I have an email that's like 1.4 million women, 700,000 customers had bought like Lady Boss lean. I think they had 26,000 people at ownership. Like you guys should buy this company. You're crazy. Not to get upset to all these different influencers and people like somebody buy this company. Like again, the Rembrandt and the attic, like it is there. It is sitting there. This Rembrandt and the attic, like how do you guys not see it and nobody can see it. And, and I had this thought. It's like, I wonder if nothing, I don't think I even wanted to buy it at that point yet, but I was more so like, what would you actually want to sell for? Like I should be able to find something that can buy this. And so I texted a brand and I'm like, how much would you actually sell this for? And I'm allowed to disclose numbers and stuff, but when he told me the number, I was like, holy crap. Um, I might actually be interested in buying that. I think he thought it was a joke. He's like, he's like, seriously, you're not a lady. I know, I know we all get it. I'm not a lady. I can't, you know, I don't wear pink. I never have, but I understand the opportunity. Right. There's Rembrandt and the attic. There's something here that's powerful. I was like, this is too cool to not do. And so I don't want to spoil all the surprises again. I want you to go to the Lady Boss Phoenix rise up event again. Here's the link again. If you haven't gone there, it's a free virtual that we'll be telling the story. We actually filmed a 25 minute documentary of Brandon and Kaylin telling their side of the story, which is like, so fascinating. You get it. Like just from a learning education point, you have to go in. If you don't want to be part of Lady Boss, but you got to get marketing secrets. Dot com slash lady boss will take you to the registration page. But anyway, uh, I decided to buy it. We made the offer and the time I was like, I don't know what to do with this. I was like, maybe we build a certification program. Right. Cause I was like, they'd already built a whole coaching program, things like that. And I was like, if we certify people to become Lady Boss trainers, then you know, those lady boss trainers are going to need funnels and need traffic. Like we can help them click funnel. So I was like, maybe that's the idea. And so we kind of started going that direction for a little while. And then I had the idea and I was nervous. Um, I was first off nervous cause I didn't want Brandon and Kaylin to find out what my idea was. Number two, I was nervous. Like, do I actually want to do this? Number three, I was also nervous. Like, I think some of the lady boss community may not be happy by this, but I also like this is the way for this business and this brand to explode, to have the impact I think is possible. If you rewind back and look at what Brandon and Kaylin were doing before all the iOS updates and all the stuff there, and they were spending almost a million dollars a month in ads to sell the products, right? And it was them doing all the traffic in the sales. And again, they built an amazing company, but 100% of marketing was relying on them. Now I have two close friends. Um, one of them goes to church with me. He started a company you may have heard of before as a little candle company, but they were wickless candles, right? There's no, there's no wick in it. So he had these candles and you may have heard of the company's called Sensey. And they're like an eight or $900 million a year company. And every time I talked to Orville, who's the owner of that, he's always like, Oh, you should launch an MLA. I'm like, why are you doing click phones in the MLA? Why don't you do that? I'm like, no, I don't want to, I don't want to sell the business model I want to do for, for click phones and my stuff, right? But every single time I'm like, I have a conversation with them. Like that's the default. Cause I'm like, I'm spending, you know, three or $4 million a month in ads now. He's like, why would you spend any money on ads? Like turning in a network marketing program and give all the money to the people instead of to Mark Zuckerberg. I'm like, I know, but like, you know, whatever I fill in the blank of why I didn't want to do it. My other friend is Brian, uh, who owns Proobit. We helped him kind of launch that way back in the day and it's been around for as long as click funnels and I don't know the exact numbers, but they were close to like $400 million last year, never spending a penny on any ad. And I was like, man, right now the ad platform is the thing that's, that's kind of wonky and, and, and people are struggling with, especially for a female weight loss business. And I was like, we have 1.3 million women on email list with 700,000 people who have purchased this product and love it. 26,000 who were on continuity when they decided to shut it down. I was like, what if instead of us dumping a whole bunch of money to Zuckerberg, we decided to do that model to make this a network marketing program where I'm number one, if people just love the way things were, they could just buy it the way it was before. It doesn't change anything for our customers, but for the women who are evangelists who are already sharing this anyway, like they're at the gym wearing their lady boss clothes and they're telling their friends about it and they're selling this stuff without getting paid for anyway. Right. Like my wife has a big old lady boss sticker on the back of our truck. So my kids know which car is hers because there's a big old lady boss sticker. People ask her all the time, what is that? Oh, it's lady boss. She should go buy some lady boss lean. My wife sold a whole bunch of lady boss lean because she tells people about it all the time and she gets nothing out of it. This whole lady boss community, a bunch of bunch of women who bring their friends in and they're bringing more friends in and they never got paid for it. Again, I've been so nervous about network marketing for so long, but I was like, this is the model that makes the most sense for this business. My biggest fear though is like, I didn't want to tell Brandon and Katelyn. They both came from network marketing background. I knew that they had some, you know, some thoughts or beliefs about it. I was just nervous about telling them, and you know, I'm 21 and she's 25. We use, are we have a network marketing background? In fact, I didn't tell them all the way up until Funal Hacking Live. Funal Hacking Live, we were trying to work on this other project together. We're doing Katelyn's actually working on a course in a mastermind on how to become an attractive character, which is so cool. Weight loss was the product, but attractive character-ness is my jam, right? They came backstage and we were kind of talking about working together on that project. Katelyn asked like, so what do you do with lady boss? I'm like, I don't really know yet. She's like, just tell me, just tell me, I can take it. I was like, oh, I don't want you to be mad about it. She's like, I would be mad. I'm like, okay. She's like, I'm going to turn it into a network marketing program. And she's like, I knew it. I knew it. We knew that's the way you were going to do. We didn't want to do it, but it's totally the best thing to do. She's like, all these women are rabid fans. They all share it anyway. She's like, we just didn't want to run that. We should like, it's the perfect model for lady boss. For most of them, they can't go and spend a million dollars a month to build their own supplement company. Right. She's like, I couldn't have done it initially, right? And to get to this point, there's so much risk and trial and error and struggle and all the things that went into actually building. She's like, with this, you can get every single woman who is a lady boss, the opportunity to start their own business, to become a little mini Katelyn, to become an influencer, to be socially can like lose weight and then make money doing it. And like, and she's all so excited. I'm like, I'm so excited that she's excited. I thought for sure she was going to like yell at me instead of tell her, I'm ruining the business. And so he got me excited. Just knowing like, Oh, okay, this is okay. This is like, this is going to be the thing. And so that's what's partially, I mean, obviously we're doing a lot of things at the lady boss Phoenix rise up event. We're talking about the relaunch, how this business is brand is rising up from the ashes to be the new version of Lady Boss, but also the message for the women who are there is that this is your opportunity for you to rise up and step into your career and step into this calling where you can actually be a lady boss, you can do a Katelyn day without the risk and the headaches and the overhead and the cost and everything that you can get in there and start being like doing this today. Right. And now working right now on a deal, hopefully, I think this is a wrestle of being horrible, keeping secrets, but we're trying to work on a deal to have Katelyn come back in and train all the lady bosses to do what she did. Like, how do you master your Instagram and Facebook and all these platforms you can build your following and make insane amounts of money talking about lady bosses. So there's so many fun things we're going to be doing with this, but it's on the foundation, the marketing distribution channel of network marketing. So it gives us the opportunity to give Zuckerberg a million dollars a month. But instead I get to give the lady bosses a million dollars a month, which I think is, is, is more exciting. And again, it's tough to know some people will be turned off by that. Some people are like, I'm going to go away, but for other people, this will become their new career. This will become a change in the life forever. And so, okay, a couple of cool things along the journey. So there's kind of the background, the model, what we're doing, but this is like, this people always ask me, well, what, like, what's the plan? Are you relaunching all the supplements and the answers? No. First thing we did is looked at, okay, here's everything that lady bosses sold in the last 10 years, right? Like, we start looking at like, where's the, where's the 80, 20, where's the 95, five, right? Like, where's most of the money making? So my question, here's Pop Quiz for you guys. And let me know in the comments down below if you're watching this on YouTube of all the products they had, like their app, they got their swag, they got their supplements, they got pre-workout, post-workout protein bars, all the things they sell. Where do you think the majority, like 90 some odd percent of all the profit comes from this business? Pop Quiz, what do you think? Okay. I mean, five seconds, five, four, three, two, one. Please subscribe. Just kidding. Okay. Do you guys know what it is? 90% of the money in this business comes from Lady Boss Lean. Okay. This is their protein shake. And I think it's like 70, 30, like 70% comes from a vanilla cake flavored and like 30% comes from the brownie batter. And then the other, like, I guess my percentages aren't correct cause that's a hundred percent, but almost all is these two flavors. Chocolate vanilla. Isn't that crazy? Brownie batter and the end cake. And the cake one's cool because you can make cookies and cookie dough and you can bake with it. And there's a million different recipes and stuff you can get with this as well. So the relaunch of the company, we're all launching all the products and all the skews eventually will bring back the ones that are best sellers. But it's nice cause we have 10 years with the data of like what people actually buy. You know, one of the things that struggles when you launch a new company, it's you, you get excited about a product, you buy the inventory, you launch it, and then the inventory sells or doesn't sell. Right. Like for example, Lady Boss, the bars, like these bars as great as having your own bar are, they just don't sell as well. Um, and they also, the shelf life's really like this right here is like, oh, it's hard as a rock because the shelf life on a bar is not that good. Okay. Chances of me bringing back a bar are zero to none. Well, maybe someday I'm not going to, I'm not going to complete it. Rolled out, but it's, it's way more expensive. It's harder than the shelf ice. Long, but like we know this work. So with it launching, we're launching them in these single serve packs. We have cake and lean. This would be the first thing that we roll out. Russell, what kind of funnel type are you using for this? Well, can you guess what funnel it's going to be? Next pop quiz, two pop quizzes in one video. Come on now. Is it a webinar funnel? Is it a challenge funnel? Is it a book funnel? Like what kind of funnel is it? The answer is it's a challenge funnel. So we're going to be launching a challenge funnel. Weight loss is big for challenges. So we'll be doing a challenge funnel and what people go and they register for the challenge and it's a weight loss challenge. It's the same challenge that Kailin used to sell for I think $97 back and they will become a free challenge. People register for the challenge, upsell them, uh, LadyBoslyn. Then they go through the challenge and start losing weight. And then I think on day eight, we will have a presentation that helped have them invite their friends to the challenge and bring more people in. And it'll kind of grow from there. And so initially, um, you know, probably year number one is going to be the two LadyBoslyn flavors, the challenge funnel, and that's where the majority of the focal point effort and all the traffic will be going to. Everyone will be referring people to the challenge. Eventually they will come back and we'll take Kailin's book and we'll do a funnel, a book funnel, eventually we'll have a new webinar, eventually we'll do other funnels. What's going to be cool about it is that, uh, us corporate will build these funnels and then people can go and they can drive traffic. They can send emails to the list. They can talk about social media. People will come join them at challenge. Someone joins the challenge and they go through the process and the funnels will help do the closing and the selling and all that kind of stuff for them, which would be really cool. It's, I'm excited because it's going to be the first legitimate case study of a network marketing company using funnels, which is crazy to me. I've been trying for a decade to network marketing companies to understand like the power of funnel. I wrote a book about it. Dan Kennedy wrote a book about it, which I found there's one copy on this plan. I found it. It's kind of cool, but that's the story from the day. These principles that we talk about, I've tried so hard and I cannot get any network marketing company to embrace funnels for whatever reason. And so what's cool about LadyBoss is that it'll be funnel driven. So we'll be having all these funnels tested, perfected, tweet, all sorts of things so that people will drive people to challenge funnel and the process happened to drive into a book funnel. The process happened. Like it'll be the first time that funnels network marketing have been done together at the corporate level at scale. I think it will change the way network marketing is done forever. And this will be the case study to show improve that the model actually works. And so how exciting is that you guys? Like if they were in network marketing, you know, cause like all of you guys are trying to build funnels on the side and then you always get slapped on hand by corporate is like, Oh, you can't do that. I've tried multiple times, multiple companies to build funnels and give them the corporate and the corporate never does anything with them. It's just like, it's insane. So what's cool about this is the fact we'll build, blend these two worlds together and show people how we can make this all work. So it's exciting. Um, and that's kind of the update. So you're getting this kind of, you know, first recap before it all launches. I'm sure we'll do more updates on LadyBoss story. Um, but the next steps are number one is we're doing the virtual event to kind of relaunch it. So again, if you, depending when you're watching this, you should go and if it's still there, go register and go watch it. If you're a marketing secrets.com slash lady boss, I'll take you to the, to the lady boss Phoenix rise up event where we should talk about this company rising from the ashes or we show in documentary and you'll see probably the first ever stack in the closed pitch ever happening in network marketing history, which is also like another pretty cool thing. Um, and then that's done, uh, like a week or two later as we launched the first challenge funnel and then you'll see that'll be the focal point is just optimizing that crazy that challenge funnel, getting people to buy LadyBoss lean and then bringing in more people to challenge funnel with them. And that'll be the game plan for probably the next 12 months. Um, then from there, we'll start adding in other, other ideas, other things, but I'm excited. I'm excited to see, uh, what the marriage of these two really fascinating, really cool, really exciting worlds for the first time ever. And so I'm excited. And maybe this is going to be a huge bomb and complete flop, which is totally possible. I have launched more than one thing that's completely flopped. This one will be really painful because there's a lot of money involved. Yeah. I'm hoping this one nails. I think it will. I'm really excited for it. So in fact, uh, when we finally made the, the formal presentation to Brandon came and Brandon lifted me said, you rise this will be bigger than quick funnels. Right. I'm like, um, I want all my companies competing against each other. Right. Because when banks compete, you win. My companies compete. I wouldn't, right? So it's, it's all good. I don't really care, but it's, it's going to be a fun one. So anyway, if you have any questions for me about Ladyboss, any other things about the model, why we did it, how we did it, all that kind of stuff. If you want to become a Ladyboss, come join in the fun. It's going to be amazing. It's blending network marketing, weight loss, and, um, and funnels and selling and all these things into one super, super company. So I'm pumped. I appreciate you guys. Make sure to subscribe, uh, to the channel ring the bell. That way you get notifications when new ones come up. We have a whole bunch of these coming out, showing behind the scenes of all the fun companies rolling out this year. We have a lot of fun stuff happening. I don't want you to miss any of it. So with that said, thank you guys so much and I'll see you on the next episode of the marketing secret show.
