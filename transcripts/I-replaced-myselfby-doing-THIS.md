What's up everybody this is Russell Brunson and welcome to Marketing Secrets Podcast. All right so I want to talk to you today so and this is something that we have been talking about a lot recently probably because we're in the middle of it in our company but it's like getting the systemization in right so the first time I ever heard about systems was I read the book E-Meth by Michael Gerber and I I remember it was probably like 12 years ago or something and at the time I started my business and I had like learned how to do everything right because I couldn't I didn't have any money outside of programming I never learned programming so I hired this guy named Dorell in Romania who still works for me to this day and so he did all the programming stuff but I had to figure everything else because I didn't have any skills so I had to learn how to do right copy I had to learn how to I didn't just either hired images but I learned all these different pieces like to marketing and traffic and sales and like and like it sucks when you first get started because it's just you and you don't have any capital or money so it's like you have to like get really talented and I think that's one of the big reasons why if you heard the intro of the show I make fun of people who take on VC money because I feel like they don't have to learn any of the stuff they just like cheat they get a bunch of money to hire people and there's never anyone on the team that actually has the skill set to to run the show like there's got to be someone who has done everything once or else it's hard to like I don't know that's just my thought thoughts my feelings so I was doing everything from writing copy doing customer support driving traffic doing sales project management everything was just me right someone I think it was Thelma Knudsen or someone at an event mentioned this book called the E-Meth and I thought oh it's like the internet market I thought he was like internet or email I don't know so so I remember we're going on a trip down to Lake Powell my wife and I and so we're heading out we swing by Barnes and Noble I go in the bookstore the business section there's a book called the E-Meth I'm like this is the one that I'll talk about so I bought it jump in the car I drive you know 12 hours down Lake Powell Utah jump on a house we'll go in the middle of the boat pull out my new book to learn about internet marketing and I start reading it has nothing to do with internet marketing I was kind of disappointed at first but I had nothing else to read so I kept writing this thing and it was all about systemization talked about you know how most entrepreneurs feel like they're juggling this thing and this thing and they're juggling it 10 different plates right you're trying to keep them all up top because you know if one of them falls the whole thing's gonna collapse you talked about basically going in there and like each of these things you're spinning it's like create a system around it plug some of that system and then and then run with it and then doing that through all the different things until eventually you've got things systemized that was kind of the gist and I've never gone super deep with Michael Gerber stuff outside of that and I don't have a couple friends who disagree with what he says but the conceptually was like this is brilliant like build systems replace the things that I'm doing and I honestly struggled with that for a long time I think most entrepreneurs do because I think the reason why is because because you have been you as the entrepreneur who had to figure out all this crap ahead of time you had to figure out how to do all these things like you're taking on like 20 or 30 different skill sets initially that you have to learn and some things you're really good at some things you are horrible but you had to figure out how to do it because because there's no one else doing it right instead of by books and study and practice and read and learn and like it was painful but I had to do it because there's no one else that could do it at the time right so then we get this point where we start trying to systemize things we start bringing people in and I think the biggest problem most of us have as we assume that the people that we're bringing in will have all the skills that we've have acquired to get this thing off the ground and what I've been learning through this new process of systemization we're doing with James P. Frill is it's less about that more like figuring out all the pieces and then bringing people that are just amazing at that one piece how do I say this the right way because I don't want to make it sound offensive because it's not even a little bit I feel like for me and for most entrepreneurs like we probably get to like level six or seven skill set at a whole bunch of things right it gets this the gets this idea off the ground right and so that's kind of that's kind of where we're at and the goal is not to bring in someone that's the same thing it's like it's like picking each one of those skill sets that you're six at you take that apart and you find 10 level person and plug them into just that one thing and so the problem with that in in our minds entrepreneurs I know how we all think is like she's saying take 10 people to replace what I'm already doing and it's like we yes but those 10 people will be able to do level 10 of what you're doing not level four you know five or six whatever you're doing right now but it takes more people to do it because there's not anyone who's going to write copy and new customer support right even though you had to do that like they they're not going to do it you got to find like level 10 support person level 10 copy person level 10 funnel person level 10 designer like all those pieces you plug them in and be okay with the fact that they're not going to do all the stuff you did they're just going to do that one piece but they're going to do way better than you their level 10 skill set is going to replace your six and now you get 10 people and all of a sudden like now it becomes magic and I'm looking at this happening right now in my business I've always been I've had an amazing team and I've been building this team for a long time and it's been it's been good but as we're specifically trying to replace me out of things I currently do which I do a lot of things I still do a lot of things and it's like I'm trying to do that I pull myself out of those pieces and it's like it's been scary but I'm trying to find level 10 people each spot plug them in and now it's like man they take my like what I didn't make better and I think that most entrepreneurs probably level 10 at one thing like I think yeah like I would say I'm level 10 at one thing so I'm keeping that piece because I love it but the rest of it we're getting other people and anyway I hope that gives you hope because I know that as I systemized stuff in the past I'd always get frustrated because I think I would try to get people three or four things like hey you're gonna write copy and do this and do this and they can do one or two but then the other ones make it make them struggle and just they never were able to be rock stars and it was by fault I didn't let them shine whereas now with the stepping away from this and just realizing look just having folks on that one thing anyway I hope that helps it was kind of big a hoff for me recently just watching it was like I went to go with Nora and I did a little meeting with my team I'm looking at like okay that's the person who plays this part of me and that person plays that part of me and that part of me I'm looking at all the things and I'm like all of them are better those things than I am this is so great I can go play with my daughter now and they're doing their their their piece of brilliance and I can go spend time with my daughter that's been the goal for me and I'm finally getting there and I hope that gives you guys some faith and some hope especially those who have tried to systemize and tried to replace yourself and or tried to hire people and have been frustrated I get it and maybe this little piece that I got over the last day or two will help you as well so hope that helps we get back in there and build some funnels makes everybody and we'll talk to you soon bye
