## Transcript
My biggest year as a salesperson that I made commission was about a little bit over 2.9, something 2.9 million, strike commission. My background in college was behavioral science and like social dynamics, how human beings make decisions. If you want to be like top 100% salesperson, you have to view that selling is collaborative. It's like you working with the prospect to help them find and solve problems that maybe they didn't know they had. So if the prospect had problems and your solution solves those, then what's the missing link? Why are they not buying from you? Well, the missing link is you. All selling is, is change. That's it. There is a direction you're taking somebody. Is there a script they're working off of? There's five tonalities that you really have to master. You have to master the, you know, curious tone. Like then there's the confused tone, like a playful tone, a challenging tone, a concerned tone. I might lean in and be like, what's really holding you back? So it's like how you shift your tone, like that really cause a prospect to actually engage with you. Do I believe in scripts? Yes. Do I believe in sound inscripted? What's up everybody? Welcome back to the channel. Today I'm excited to be interviewing one of my friends, Jeremy Minor, and I'm excited because I feel like in the last hundred years, there's a lot of people who have taught sales, but the most part it's just kind of been the same thing. And you popped up, started popping up in my news feed probably two years ago, started seeing it. And at first I was like, huh, no, someone teaching sales, like what's going to be new from here? And then as I started digging into your stuff and watching your training and going into it, I was like, oh, this is actually unique and different and really cool. So much so that I know I'm under NDA, but like we're using everything he's doing inside of our for our sales team and stuff like that. I know when you announced that yesterday in the mastermind, I'm like, I felt we had an NDA. I'm not really sure. Okay. There we go. I'm not keeping secrets. I know Matt's like, do not say anything. We're under an NDA. I'm like lips are sealed. There's like three or four people in the whole company that know we're doing this. And then first of all, I'm like, oh yeah, by the way, Jeremy, you know, the seven levels training are about to start training our sales people. I'm like, oh, well, sure. Okay. Yeah, there we go. It was interesting to like just see us have context. Like we build a sales team, man, probably 15 years ago, maybe 64 times sales guys. Like we were one of the first in this industry who were doing like, sell something online, call them on the phone. Okay. And nowadays, a lot of people are doing that teaching it, talking about it. But again, like I said, what you guys are doing is a different level, which is why I wanted to talk to you here. But to begin with, I want to get context for you. So before you started doing sales training, you were doing sales. And I know, hopefully I would have been in sales before I did sales training. Oh, you get a sales. How good were you? Like bragging about yourself a bit. What would you like to know? I saw stats somewhere, I don't know the exact number, but like, actual sales commissions in the year, which is ridiculous. My best year, like commission only, because I only like negotiated commission only jobs. So like after my first year, because I started like selling door to door, like for what would you would now known as Vivint in the solid city to start with Pinnacle security, then moved to Apex, it went to Vivint. And then so I was used to like, like straight commissions. So then I got into the B2B world after that. And then everybody like, we'll pay you like, you know, this huge salary and like tiny commission, like, no, no, no, no, no, I don't want any salary, but I want like this percentage of commission, you know, and they're always like, that's great. And I'm like, yes, that's really great. See, I've covered my sales process. But my biggest year as a sales person that I made commission was about a little bit over 2.9 something 2.9 million straight commission. But there were several years in a row where I was making over like 2.4, 2.5 every year, W2 or 10 and 9.9. It's crazy because like, I see like the top tier sales people and rightfully so that I brag, I did a million dollars in sales this year or whatever, which is great. On a seven figure closer. Yeah. Like, no, you're really not, you know, in my world, you're not. But yeah. So how did you get, I mean, outside of negotiating commissions, but like, what were you doing differently? Do you think to? Well, I probably had an unfair advantage. So my background in college was behavioral science and like social dynamics. So it's like really like, I don't want to give all the nerd stuff, but it's really the study of the brain and how, how human beings make decisions. So I started learning just, you know, just how to work with human behavior, I would say. So I started taking like courses from like people like you would probably know, like Robert Caldini and stuff like that. I started taking like advanced courses from just, you know, weird stuff like psychologists and stuff that really didn't have anything to do with selling. I started taking like, I wanted to learn like advanced tonality and body language. So I would hire like acting trainers and stuff that would like train you how to use your facial expressions to like convey a different tone. And so that really probably set me apart than just like reading a traditional selling book, like you got to set goals, you got to work harder, you know, like that stuff was really boring to me. Your six different closes you could choose. Yeah, like here's the the one thousand and three hundred and sixty five closing techniques. I'm just like, it's so transactional and so like nonhuman that it triggers sales resistance. So I learned how to like the one thing that we really train salespeople in any industry is how do you get the prospect to let their guard down? Like initially where they become open to what you're even talking about. So I started learning how to do that and selling became pretty easy at that point. Yeah. Yeah. And then you coined coined the phrase of the term but any PQ is your methodology. Yeah, that is our methodology. So any PQ stands for Neuro Emotional Persuasion Questioning. So it's just my methodology that I developed over like about an 18 year sales career was in four different industries, to be to see to be to be made seven figures a year in commissions and all of those industries, multiple seven figures and three of those industries per year. And that's why we say like when people come back to like, oh, I'm a seven figure closer, we're going to go back to it because there was like, I'm a seven figure closer, I closed two million in sales. I'm like, so you made 250 grand, that's great. But like to be a seven figure closer, you like in my mind, like you have to be earning that much per year in commissions. So yeah. So any PQ comes from like my behavioral science background. I'm like a nerd. Yeah. So I think in my world is two, there's two types of people who probably listen. This one is like the marketing nerds like me who like, we say we market something that we have a phone call in the back and then there are people who are doing sales or want to do sales. And so maybe start from the sales standpoint. So give us some basic, I understand the principles of an APQ. I got some core things that someone could grab on to and like start applying right away. I mean, the biggest thing with us with an APQ is like, you know, just one core principle that we would teach is to listen to what the prospect means, not just what they say. And that's a big difference. I think most salespeople just conceptually don't understand. Like, I might ask you what we would call a commitment question, like to get you to commit to take the next step. I might say, you know, do you feel like this could be the answer for you? And you'd be like, yeah, I mean, yeah. I mean, that tells me that you're uncertain, that you've got concerns, whereas most salespeople would be like, okay. And like, he said, yes, let's go, let's sign the agreement. But that to me, like I'm hearing your tone. And that tells me you're uncertain, you're concerned. I might just, I don't seem, you don't seem, you seem a bit unsure. Like, what's cool, you know, what's behind that, you know, I want them to open up. So that's just one concept that we would teach, like, listening to what they mean, not just what they say. Interesting. We had, this was in the sales position, but one of our top customer support people had a conversation with them. And I was like, how are you so good? Like, you answer, everyone loves you. And they said the same thing that I like, I don't respond what they ask me, I respond what they're actually saying. He's like, I don't want to teach that or how to coach that, because it's like, it's, you know, human dynamics, like, how do you actually know what they're saying? But yeah, that's why he was so great, because he was able to look at that. And that's how you teach that. This is something that everybody, I think there's, there's a Smith out there in the world of selling. And I think he'd been marketing that, that people are born with these skills, you know, like, I grew up on a freaking like cattle ranch in the middle of Missouri, outside of a town with less than 800 people in it. Like, you know, I wasn't born out of my mother's womb with like advanced for questioning skills, you know, I wasn't born out of my mother's womb, like advanced tonality, like I wasn't born with advanced, you know, objection prevention or handling skills, like I just acquired those skills, like I learned those skills. So if, if I can learn them right coming from a farm, that means anybody can acquire those skills. And in fact, we always hear like sales, we like, I'll do a keynote and like, somebody will be like, Oh, I've got the gift of the gab, you know, like, I'm so, you know, I'm going to be so great. It says, I remember I'm training this, this pest control company over the East Coast here about six months ago. And I asked him some question and one guy randomly said in the back and he's like, I'm brand new, I haven't started, but I got the gift of the gab. My mom said I could sell anything to anybody. And I'm like, actually, the gift is a gab is probably going to hurt you because you've heard that saying, you know, telling is not selling. The gift of the gab, actually, we have to train salespeople like actually how to like stop talking so much, like how to like slow down and verbal pace the questions that you're talking about. Because a lot of times, like salespeople ask questions are good, but they ask them so fast that the prospect has no time to internalize what they're actually asking. And so that's why they get like a knee jerk, like surface level answer. So you go into a car dealership, right? And the salesman comes up, hey, how's it going? How can I help you real quick? You're like, Oh, just looking. Yeah, right. It's a knee jerk reaction. But if I slow down my tone, if I'm, let me get, try to get the right tone. So they walk in, I might say, Hey, hey, welcome into the, the dealership. Are you guys out just maybe kind of looking around today or what's going on? And I just slow down my tongue. Are you out, you know, looking around? Yeah, we're looking around. Do you know what you're, do you know what you're maybe looking for? Like I'm kind of confused, right? So I draw them in. So it's like, how you shift your tone, like how do you slow down like verbal pace, your questions out that really cause a prospect to actually engage with you for super interesting. So I, I'm not a good one on one salesperson, probably the worst in the world because you, because you talk really fast. Well, just, you're obviously the best marketer, but I'm great on one to many, right? And so was the things that I was trying to learn how to do that. Like, and again, people watch me and they're like, you talk too fast, Russell, which I do. But at the same time, like I was studying, I was studying when I was trying to learn how to speak from stage, like really good presenters. And it wasn't just people selling, it was like religious leaders and it was other people. And that was a thing I noticed about was like their ability to use tonality, like speed and like loud and quiet. It's like, I start fluctuating your tone. Yeah, I would practice that right. And then I stop. Yeah. Like about quieter. You see the audience, they lean in, lean out. It's like, I say that from that standpoint. Yeah. It's kind of what Tony Robbins does. If you, you know, I mean, you know Tony, right? So if you watch Tony, like he'll like, he'll get really fast and like really emotional and then he like slows down like verbal pause. He's a master that, you know, obviously that's something that he was born with, something that was taught in that like President Obama, I'm not into politics, but like President Obama was really good when he was speaking. And that's why he engaged so many people is he would say something really, you know, prophetic or whatever his beliefs were, then he would kind of like verbal pause and like slow down his senses and let people internalize and think about it. You know, like, I love them, you know, so that's, that's those type of things like make the difference in influencing somebody or like somebody buying something from you compared to just, you know, asking scripted questions where he sounded like a robot. Yeah. So with your, when you do work, people talk about, because obviously there is a direction you're taking somebody, is there a script they're working off of or not? Or how does it? So I believe in like sales structures, like, you know, you go back to like Hollywood, you see like the best actors and actresses and you watch your movies and everything they say is pretty much 100% scripted. But does it sound scripted? No, that's because they memorize their lines. So as a sales person, you have to have a structure in your mind, you have to have questions you've got memorized. Now, that doesn't mean because let's say if I'm, well, we would ask a, it's called an NDPQ situation question to find out what their situation is. And if they say something different, you know, that I'm not necessarily used to, I'm going to have to kind of change that next question I'm asking on the run, but I'm still in my framework. That makes sense. So that's why in NDPQ, we have everything from connection questions to situation questions to problem awareness, to solution awareness, to consequence. And so that's why we've been able to go into any industry. We're in 161 industries now and be able to duplicate that process. And it doesn't matter if it's selling insurance to, you know, coaching and consulting or, you know, cars or cybersecurity doesn't really matter to the industry, we're able to duplicate because we have all these sales people on this framework where they know what they're looking for. And sometimes they have to relanguage the question based on the answer they're getting from the prospect. It makes sense. So do I believe in scripts? Yes. Do I believe in sounding scripted? No. Yeah. That's an inference. I mean, you know, you get on the phone with salespeople and the worst ones, ones where you like throw a little detour in and they're like, and they know what to do and they're like, come back. And then they just go to the next question. Yeah, they're like, ask you the same question again. You're like, I just, you know, they sound like a telemarketer, right? And it's that's bad, but it's also, it's kind of like it's both are bad. It's like the ones that just kind of wing it and don't really know where they're going, like that's not going to work. And you can't sound scripted. So that's where your tone comes across, you know, we train like there's five tonalities that you really have to master. You have to master the, the, you know, curious tone. Like, walk me through what do you guys do to, you know, generate new leads and clients now, like if I'm selling leads to say a real estate agent, whatever, you know, then there's the confused tone. Like, I'm not understanding how to, how did you mean when you said XYZ? That's a confused tone, right? So why do I use a confused tone when I want them to clarify a pro because that would cause the prospects brain to be like, and they don't even know that what's going on, but it causes their brain to be like, oh, I didn't like really tell him, I didn't really explain that what really well, I need to clarify it better. So that causes them to go deeper into that, like maybe problem they were talking about. So it gives them to relive their pain, right? So a confused tone would do that. If I didn't use a confused tone there, you know, if I used a curious tone, like, oh, what, what happened when you said that? I think it doesn't do anything, right? It needs to get them to internalize. Then there's like, you know, a challenging tone. So you're not going to use a challenging tone at the beginning of a conversation, but I might be halfway through and I might be say, so, so what happens if you don't do anything about this and the situation gets worse? So that's kind of a challenging tone where they kind of push back like, no, I need to do it now, right? But if I didn't use that tone, I wouldn't get that emotional reaction. And then there's like a, you know, a concern tone, I might lean in and be like, you know, what, what's really holding you back? You know, like tone that shows empathy, right? Because then that communicates, see, my tone is how the prospect interprets the intention behind every question I ask. Right. So they feel I'm concerned, they will typically trust me more and start to emotionally open up more. If they don't feel I'm concerned, they shut down. And then there's like a playful tone, you know, let's say if somebody like comes to a call and they're late, you know, I might say, well, what are we going to do with you, man? What's going on? Or I might, you know, like, if they're like, Hey, how are you doing it? I'm like, oh, you know, just hanging out being the boring guy. What about you? You know, playful tone. So like, all these types of tones influence the way the prospect's brain will react. Do you try to hit all of them in every conversation? Is it based on the type of question or just kind of depends? Based on the type of question, right? So typically, if I'm in and it depends on the industry, like, so if I'm a, let's say my asking connection questions, like take the focus off me and put it on them, I'm going to use more of a curious tone, like, oh, you know, you saw the ad like, how long have you been following Jeremy for? Oh, you follow him on IG, you know, just that's a connection question, you know, so I'm going to use more of a curious tone there. Confused tone will probably be more used like if I'm probing, you know, like if you tell me a problem, hold on, how long has that been going on for? See, that's a confused tone, right? So if I'm probing, I'm probably using more confused tone. And it's something I actually learned on the, I know, it's crazy, but it's something I learned on the doorstep. So when I started selling door to door, there just wasn't much training, right? They give you a script. Here's two books by, you know, some gurus who haven't sold anything for 40 years, you know, they're like 90 years old, and I'll be 91 day two. So I'm making fun of myself. But they're like, Hey, just go out there, it's going to be easy. And so I learned when I knock on the door, I'm like, Hey, you know, it's Jeremy, I'm with XYZ company. And the reason why we're out here, and they'd be like slam, not interested, you know, just really quick, because I would just go into like talking. And that's what every other salesperson that was knocking on the door selling anything was saying every day. So I'm like, Okay, what am I supposed to do? And this is when I first started learning like the what we would call pattern interrupts. I didn't call it that back then, but I'm like, how do I break this pattern where they were at triggers curiosity? Because I was learning about like, how do you trigger curiosity in the human mind? So I knock on the door and I started like changing everything I wore. So I started wearing like khaki shorts and everybody wears them now. It's like, I don't know if they got it for me, but khaki shorts, regular like t shirt, I would wear like the old man new balance shoes, you know, the white old man shoes, the comfortable ones. I wear that I put a tape measure on the side of the t shirt, you got to tape, you know, measure where the alarm's going to go. And then I would wear like these weird, like just regular glasses. I'd wear like a $10 like Walmart watch. And then I would have like this, like those metal clipboards type of thing. You're taking a survey, right? I wanted them to view me as like the survey guy or the meter reader. And then I bought like this construction bus. This bag. So I'd buy like it. I bought like a lime green one or like an orange one. I knock on the door and so I'd be like, like walking around the roof and everything not to me come out and they're like, how can I help you? I'm like, yeah, are you guys the, are you the property owners here? And they're like, yeah, we're the property owners. What's going on? Like instantly patterned rough triggers curiosity. And so I learned just how to do that. And I instead of knocking 100 doors to get a sale, I literally could knock on five, and I would sell three out of five. And everybody's like, you know, this guy doesn't work hardly at all. And he makes five times more money than all of this. Like, what the hell's going on? So that's kind of how I started learning how to like trigger curiosity that reminds me of a Danny Kennedy or no, Gary Halber story. Gary Halber was doing direct mail campaigns and like, he was doing the he go to the seminars like, this is how you do direct mail, you do this. And so he'd like do the same thing. And then one day someone asked him a question, like if if your family's life depended on somebody actually getting the mail opening, what would you do different? He's like, well, I wouldn't have body copy on the envelope. I'd make the stamp crooked. I'd use blue ink. And so he like went to exercise and he's like, what if I did a campaign that way? And so he wrote this one page sales letter is famous called the coat of arms sales. You want to see it had a whole team of people hand right in blue ink, put a cricket letter on a mail that I think that letter got mailed like 100 million times, like the most mail direct sales letter of all time made him a multi bill, you know, whatever. But it's because that thought of just like, everyone's doing this, how do I do the opposite? Yeah, and see what happens. It's always the opposite because like when you, you know, like I'll do a real unlike cold calling, you know, there's this like, there's this one industry where we've like really dominate. I mean, it's the, you know, the second largest industry to train now is real estate. So that's like commercial real estate agents, you know, residential real estate, and then investors that call to stress properties. And so there's this huge company, you probably know them, but anyways, I can't say who they are. There's this huge company that we train and they're like, you know, we suck at cold calling like we have these lists. And so I wrote this cold calling script, we're actually getting a 71%. So when prospect answers, cold straight cold call 71%, now moved from them answering to booking a next step appointment, which is unheard of in cold calling. And so what I did is I'm like, okay, I've got to learn how I've got to do a pattern rep. So I can't sound like all the other cold callers calling these properties like, Hey, I'm with XYZ, you know, real estate and we like your house and would you be willing to accept a, you know, a cash offer 30 days, you know, and they're like, yes or no, and then that's it. And like 99.9% say no, right? Because they're just sale as person selling me something. So like, I'm like, okay, so here's what I want you to do. I want you to go print off the property tax records of these homes you're calling. And they're like, what? And I'm like, no, just do it because you got to be authentic. I want to literally print off the property, you can get property tax records on these homes you're calling. And so when you're calling them, I want you to hold them in your hand. And I want you to like make noises with them. So like when you call, so it's like, it's like a total pattern up like, because when you call, you want me to do it? Yeah, I got to do it. Okay, I've got to get the right tone. Yeah, you got to, yeah. I need actually some papers that should be better. But we have paper back here. Anybody got any papers? We got any papers? Oh, yeah, perfect. Give me some papers here. See if I get it. So when they call, let's see if I can remember this. They're like, you know, this is Jenny. Yeah, Jenny, it's a Sturmey Miner with XYZ company. I'm holding a copy of your property tax records of your home there in 55 Will and Savannah. I was wondering if you could help me out for a moment. There was a, yeah, sure. Because nobody's gonna be like, not interested when you say I'm holding a copy of your property tax records of your home. Oh, 75 Willisbury. And see, I'm doing this, they're hearing that. Like, yeah, what's going on? I'm like, well, and I'm not even sure if it would make sense for us to talk. So that's like a push them away type of thing. But I'm not even sure it would make sense for us to talk. I represent a group of buyers that are, they're actually looking to acquire, there's like five or maybe six different properties there by your Willowane property. And they were having me go through your property tax records on that home. And they asked me to call you to see if you would be opposed to having a conversation about possibly even selling it. Should we, should we be talking about that? 71%? Yeah, sure. What's going on, you know, and it just triggers curiosity. So a couple of things that I just said there when you're doing this. So I remember I did a reel on this one time, people like, that would never work. I can't believe it. But then people in the company that we were training, they're like, dude, we're getting like 71% response rate. Like, you guys just keep doing what you guys are doing. Like, it's not going to work. But it's just an example of a pattern interrupt because nobody's going to hang up the phone. It isn't because you're holding a pop copy of their property tax record. So it triggers curiosity. How'd you get my property tax record? Who are you guys again? What's going on? And that's all I have to do is I just have to trigger that pattern interrupt to get them to want to engage back and forth and then just build the gap. So this is an example. So cool. So the last set of questions I'm going to ask you now, because obviously, from a sales standpoint, this is the same, like all these are such cool things. But after you were salesperson, you went and you built your company now where you're doing sales training stuff like that. So a lot of the people who follow me are marketers or funnel builders are doing stuff like that. And so, yeah, but I remember for me, like I was an internet nerd. And so before we ever had people on the phones, like I was like, you sell things through email and through that was how we did things. I remember the very first time actually a friend working with me had worked at a call center and he was like, he was kind of shocked the other way. He's like, I can't believe you will buy things through email. Like we had you on the phone. Yeah. And this is man almost 18 years ago. Oh my gosh. That's awesome. Who company's collapsing. Yeah. And I was like, how do we save this? And he was like, let's figure it out away. So I sent an email, I sold a member's a free DVD, people would buy the DVD and then he called on the phone and he's like, hey, you bought the DVD and he sells something. And we did that in the very first month, we made a $5,500 offer and first, or assume the first week he sold it, he sold 11 of them. And I remember I was like, we made more money here. And he was like, anyway, so it's like this yin and yang of like the funnels on the marketing and the phone sales. I just love you talk about like, for people who are primarily just doing the internet stuff, like adding this piece on the back end, like how can you transfer a business? Yeah, I think you have to have the right, you have to know what to do. So there's so much out there, like you said, like everything's been the same for 100 years. Like to me, communication goes all the way back to like the dawn of mankind. I'm like very philosophical, but like, if you look at like, you know, you study the Bible, like the war of heaven, right? Everybody's like, oh, there's a war of heaven. But like, do you really think about what that means? Like, was it a war of like tanks and like guns and like swords and like this fights? No, it was a war of words. It was a war of influence. It was a war of persuasion. So to me, like selling, like when you understand what selling means, it's not like adversarial, like it's not you against the prospect trying to win them over so you can make money. Like that's what average salespeople do. Like if you want to be like top 1% salesperson, or if you want to, you know, company that scales, you have to view that selling is collaborative. It's like you working with the prospect to help them find and solve problems that maybe they didn't know they had. Like you heard me in there talking about like, well, how are you seeding a problem in their mind? Like, you know, because a lot of people just don't know what they don't know. So I think a lot of marketers out there, I think you're so great at seeding problems. I think if you just took what you're doing in marketing and actually applied it to sales, because you're good, all these marketers are so great at seeding problems in their copy that the prospect starts to internalize and maybe didn't think they know they had. But then when their salespeople get on there, it's like they ask two questions, you know, what's your biggest problem? What are you looking for in a solution? And then the prospect tells them a problem. They're like, oh, well, let me tell you, we solved that. And they go right into their pitch, right? It's like exactly opposite of what you're doing in your marketing. So like once you once you learn how to, you know, ask the right questions the right time, the right tone, and you help the prospect find problems in their mind that they didn't know they had, they start to view you more as like the expert, right? Like the authority, that's how they view you in marketing, right? So if you transfer that into sales, which that's what we do, you know, human behavior, it's actually really easy to sell because what I always say here is like, right, when we train salespeople or companies, we're like, who has the problem? You are the prospect. And then like, well, the prospect has the problem. Like, yeah, the prospect has the problems. Who has a solution to solve those problems? You do. So if the prospect have problems, and your solution solves those, then what's the missing link? Why are they not buying from you? Well, the missing link is you. It's what you're saying. It's what you're not asking. It's how you don't understand how to use your tone, because the prospect has the problems, your solution solves those, it should be a pretty good match, right? And so what we train salespeople is like, how do you get the, since the prospect has the problems, how do you get them to do all the work? See, I don't have the problem, right? Prospect has the problem. So how do I get the prospect to do all the work? How do I get the prospect to sell themselves? How do I get the prospect to overcome their own concerns? And how do I get the prospect to pull me in? Whereas traditional sales training would be like, you got to do the work, you got to do the convincing, you got to do the persuading, you got to overcome their own objections, like you got to push and pressure. And that's only going to get you to like a certain level. And I think that's where a lot of marketers just, you know, they don't know what they don't know, because they're so great at marketing, that what they're doing in marketing, if they just learned how to put that into their sales team, they would actually blow up times 10. And that's, that's what we do. Yeah. Yeah. So cool. A bunch of boring stuff, you know. Yeah. Tons of money. Why appreciate you coming out and sharing the stuff. Like I said, I talk about marketing with my people whenever we talk about sales. And like I said, I'm super impressed with just how unique your angle and direction is on it. So I think like, like I said, it's like, so many marketers, like I see your stuff and invest stuff is so good at seeding doubt in the prospects mind through just things they say and they ask and framing and looping. And I'm like, they just don't understand how to do it on the sales side. And they're just so used to like, you know, our sales people are going to buy this book from the sales trainer that hasn't sold anything for this book. And you know, it's like, you know, like, boy, the room selling type of techniques. And it's such a disconnect from the prospect going from their copy, which seeds that and like sets them up. And then they get on a sales call. And it's like, you know, they're trying to like, you know, push and pressure them. And that doesn't mean you get to the end of a call or a zoom appointment or in person. You're like, well, let me know if you're interested, you know, email me back, like that's not going to do anything as well. You have to like, we always say you have to build a gap, right? It's like, you have to help the prospect understand what their real situation is. Because as you know, when you do copy, most prospects don't really understand what the real situation is, do they? Right? It's your job is to market our sales people to help them understand. As a salesperson, you can't tell them what their real situation is. You can't tell them their problems because you're biased. That's just going to go in one ear out the other. Your questions have to get them to start to internalize and tell themselves what their problems are. And what that does is it starts to build a gap. So we call this like their current state or current situation, building a gap to what we would call their objective state, like what does their future look like once the newfound problems are solved? How do you build a gap? Like I said, you can't tell them what the problems are, your questioning, your tone allows them to internalize and to tell themselves their problems. And what that does, like you guys do in marketing, is it builds massive urgency for them to want to change. What's the biggest emotional driver in a human being that causes them to want to change? Pain or the fear of future pain? So if you can help the prospect relive their pain or at least have the fear of future pain, like what are the consequences if they don't do anything, then they don't feel like they need to change. And if they don't feel like they need to change, there's no urgency for them to do something. So that's the biggest thing. I always say selling is about change. There's nothing else. But how do you get a human being to change? Because human beings don't like change, because you have to help them overcome that fear of change to actually get what they want. Yeah. So good. Crazy stuff. Yeah. So you started following me two years ago, huh? I mean, we were in that big two, well, we were decent size two years ago. But yeah, the first time you come into your circle, I was like, Hey, oh, really? Well, I remember you come through any PQ, I kept seeing that over and over and over again. And first I was like, Oh, she's right, he's wrapping something different. But then like, I kept seeing it so consistently. When people were consistent, I started, I'm always like, they're doing something or they're not going to be this consistent. I started looking deeper. And I was like, Oh, this is actually different. This is really cool. Yeah. I like I said, you know, behavior science, social dynamics, like there's not, you know, there's not much out there on that. So we have a little bit of an advantage, you know, but there you go. Well, it's interesting. I've been, you know, we started down this journey with you guys are working with you, just finding other people I knew, right? Oh, yeah, they're, they're training our whole team. And they're doing this, like, it's really fascinating to see how they're everywhere. Yeah. How many people's hands that you're in, applying the stuff and just making the sales world better from the inside out, which is amazing. I mean, it's really fun for me. Like it's, I really like it. Like, you know, so we had an offer to like, you know, for a company to buy us and we're like, yeah, but I mean, it's just money. Like I should really have better have fun. You know, I think for me, like when I started teaching fun to those people, my favorite part was seeing all these other industries apply it, like that I'd never been in, but I was like, I knew they still work. Yeah. Probably similar for you. It's like, I can't believe this works here and here. Yeah, because I was only in four industries. I was in two B2B. I mean, there, so I was in like financial debt relief services, B2B. I was in network marketing, made a lot of money there, B2C, you know, door to door B2C. And then I sold like financial events to B2B and B2C. So I was only in four industries. So when I started seventh level, like late 2018, which was just being my assistant, actually won that two Comm Move parts. Do you want me to tell you a funny thing? So that year that I started, I made my assistant for my job and I did three webinars, made like 1.3 million in sales and I spent 1.8. So I'm like, I lost 500 grand my first show. I'm like, Oh, it's not good to keep losing 500,000 every year. I'm like, how many more years can I keep losing half a million a year and like then have to retire and go back to work. So I'm like, you know, then I started like figuring out like, Oh, I need a team and I need to learn how to do some stuff, you know, because you can, like you said, you can have the best product or service in the world. But if you don't have a team around you to market it into, you know, to like a great CEO, to run the business and those type of things are really usually going to struggle, you know. So it takes a while to, it takes a while to grow. It's frustrating, right? Because you like, you have a successful career, like, Oh, I'm just going to go in here and like, in a month, we'll be up here. And it's like, Oh, well, you have to build like an infrastructure and like, all this stuff, you know, that I didn't know about, you know, basically being here, appreciate you. Well, thanks for having me on. People want to learn more about APQ and you and everywhere's the best place for them to go. Let's have them go, we'll give them one of our free Facebook groups.

We have a deal with Barnes and Noble, I will get upset because and type in the new model of selling Jeremy Minor or Jerry A. Cuff, new model of selling barnesonobled.com. It's a good book. Yeah. Bezos got him money. Don't go to Amazon. I know, don't go to Amazon. Please. You know, I think it's like 50 cents more from Barnes and Noble. So, you know, we have a deal with them. The more books they sell online, the more shelves in their stores over the United States, they put no Amazon. I like Amazon. I'm sure we have book sales there, but there you go. That's awesome.

I like watching like the history channel and like documentaries all night. Saturday night, I'm like, oh man, this is great documentary. I'm like the German collapse of the World War II, like in Bulgaria, you know, like people are like, why do you watch that weird stuff? I don't know. I just really like his stuff. So cool. So I love seeing all your stuff, you know, especially with the LDS church and stuff. That's pretty cool. Yeah. Good stuff. Very cool.
