What's up everybody this is Russell and I am in Fiji. I'm at the Namali resort and this is actually the second time I've been here. Ten years ago I came with my wife and my kids and now we're back in Decade later. Welcome. How are you doing? Amazing. Oh our pleasure. Our pleasure. Do you want to see around the property sometime? Yeah absolutely. We have 19 different units and those 19 units are divided into six different categories. Okay so you come on in. Got a pool table, a little kitchen. Fiji makes me so happy. It makes me so happy here. So a little sitting room and I have my kids sleeping on this couch. And then the bed. Look how cute. Okay mosquito net for night. And a cute little heart with some treasures. And a bathroom. Oh my god a stone. So this actually was Tony's first house before they built the one that he has now. So this is kind of the back that he takes us to our private beach. Right there is our private pool. Oh it's warm. Is it really? It's warm. Oh man. So exciting. I love this place so much. It's a 10,000 square foot spa with only four treatment rooms. He dedicates a third of the spa with that hydrotherapy room. He really wants his guests to have the same experiences as his family and his friends that he brings out here. Hello. This is incredible. What's happening? Oh my gosh so we're getting a moonlight massage in a Fijian storm. And look how cute our tables. They have our names on our tables. The bachelor was actually here. I remember watching Ashley's season. It shows them pulling up to Nimalie. We see the gates and my wife and I start freaking out right. That's Nimalie we've never been before. And so now that we're back I'm excited to actually see where some of the cool parts happen from the bachelor's show. Well this here we now call it the cave. This developed out of the location team that was here. They needed some locations to have some romantic dining and they looked here and they chose this. This is where you've spent hours and hours every day working out right. This is the fitness center. It's open 24 hours. It's actually a hand-me-down gym. It's Tony's stuff when he buys new stuff. The equipment is beyond what you'd expect in most hotel gyms. Not only is this Fiji's only bowling alley. I think it's the only place in the world you can bowl and sandals. Other resorts which are built to be very nice but they're built to be businesses. We do the same thing. We use Tony's business principles to run the resort. However Nimalie didn't start out as a resort. It started out as a personal retreat for himself and his family and he was using it as kind of a think tank, a place to come and immerse himself in his writing. Nimalie on the ocean side we have 250 acres and we have 19 units. Every unit has privacy. That's really important to Tony. Of course we wanted to run efficiently. We wanted to make money but that's not the most important thing. The most important thing is the experience we're delivering to the guests. We've got to figure out how to do it in a profitable way.
