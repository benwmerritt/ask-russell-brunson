All right, welcome back. So this is a concept that is one of the least understood, yet one of the most important. I'm hoping that I can do this justice to you understand. This is a concept that we call creating an offer. So what is an offer? So an offer is if you were asking somebody for their money or their email address or their phone number or their attention, you're trading it with them, right? And it comes down to an offer. And so what is an offer? But it's an offer is not a product. For example, when I had my supplement company, I was selling my supplements as an offer. And there are people selling the exact same supplement for me on Amazon. We're selling ours for $67 a bottle and they're selling those for $19.95 of a bottle. And I was making way more money than them because I created an offer. So an offer is it's taking things and combining them together, right? If I'm just selling a supplement bottle, like it's only worth whatever that thing is, and people are going to price shop and figure out what's the cheapest and they're going to go for it. If I sell, if someone's selling a supplement bottle, I'm selling the same supplement. I'm going to save the supplement. Mine comes with a weight loss guide, a calorie tracker and whatever. Now these are things that I can bundle together into an offer. Now this has worked way more than the other thing over here. If you look at companies like Groupon and Living Social, I'm not a big fan of people running their businesses into those things. But if you look at them, they've become really, really good at creating offers for local businesses, right? A lot of local businesses I've saw prior to Groupon would run ads that are just like, hey, we've been in business for 49 years and we're family loved and locally owned. That was what they were selling on their pages. That's not an offer. An offer is like, hey, if you come to us, we will give you this thing. So an offer doesn't just have to be discounting prices. It could be bundling things together. Your ability to have success with funnels and with any kind of business is your ability to create really good, irresistible offers. What's an offer that people have to have? So bad they're like, I have to give this person my email address because I need that thing, right? What's the offer that you have? Okay? And so we talked about before the value adder, right? We're taking people through the steps of the value adder. So I'm trying to give value to people. But with that, the way that I get that value is I create an offer for them. And in fact, the offer actually starts clear back on the ad, right? The ad is not going to say, hey, we've been family, family owner operated 49 years. Click here to find out more. Like that's a horrible offer. That's the worst offer ever. But if it's like, hey, are you struggling with whatever, like this kind of pain or whatever? So find out how we can get rid of your pain the next three weeks. Boom, that's an offer. So they're like, what is that? They click on the page, they come to the next step in the funnel, the very first page they land on, and there I'm making them this offer, right? Like, hey, so you want to figure out how to get a pain? I wrote a report. It's a six page report. It's going to walk through exactly the fastest ways you get out of pain. If you give me your email address, I will trade you this thing. Okay? There's an ice made in my offer. Every single one of these, these steps in your funnel from the ad, to the landing page, to the upsells, to the downsells, to the registrations, like everything you're doing in any kind of funnel. No matter which one it is, it's all about creating really, really good offers. And that's how you provide value for people as you're moving them through the value ladder. Okay? And a lot of people, they think about offers from a standpoint of like, like this is the product I'm actually selling, but again, it's not just the selling of the product. It's like every single step. The offer's on the ad, the offer's on the landing page, and the offers are shifting as you're providing more value through the value ladder. Okay? Now one way to do this, there's a concept that we talk about a lot here in ClickFunnels, our internal community. We call this funnel hacking. And what funnel hacking is all about is like going out there and like seeing what other people are doing, like getting ideas for other offers. And sometimes you're looking for offer ideas from people that are in your same industry. So let's say you're a dentist, let's say you're selling information, products, whatever. You can look like, how are other people creating offers that are really irresistible, that are sexy offers? And we're looking at those type of things and you can funnel hack other people and say, okay, on the landing page, they offered me this, and then the upsell, they offered me this, and just getting ideas of different ways to structure offers. Okay? So if your funnel is not working, there's usually a few reasons why one might not work. One is, you know, the traffic might be bad, but if the traffic is good and they're coming to your funnel, you know, one of the biggest things to look at if it's not working is like, okay, nobody's opting in, it's because your offer sucks. Okay? We gotta talk about this internally. Like, look, if your offer sucks, you need to crank it up, make it more sexy. And a lot of times I might make four, five, or six different offers before I find the one that's like, oh, that's the one that people resonate with, that's the one they're excited for. Now they start coming in and you figure out the right offer, everything else takes care of itself. So that's what I want you guys kind of thinking through. Again, it's something that's kind of counterintuitive because most people in business, they're used to, you know, going to Amazon and seeing here's the picture of the bottle and this is the five bullet points of why it's awesome and then here's why, you know, how you can get super cheap and we got two-day delivery. Like that's not an offer. I want you guys thinking through that, thinking through how do you create an offer, what could the offer be on each of the steps inside of your funnel. Okay? So this is your homework is take the funnel you created from the funnel cookbook walkthrough and look at all the different pages. On the last video, you kind of look through the value out, you say, okay, what's the value? I'm trying to give them here and here and here. Now you're figuring out what's the offer that I'm going to give them at each step in this process. And then the next video we're going to go through is actually going to talk about like how, like what are the words, what's that we call this copy? What's the copy on each of the pages in this process to actually sell that and get them excited about giving you their money or their email address or whatever the thing might be. So that's the next step. So that's your assignment for right now. Go do that you guys and we'll see you on the next training.
