## Transcript
What's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the Russell Brunson Show. That's kind of repetitive now I say it. We are in episode number two and as I told you guys last time, we rebranded the show to the Russell Brunson show. So I can talk about all the things I'm excited by and we're going to be rotating through marketing, selling, success, personal development, a whole bunch of fun things. And today when we took going deeper into some of the secrets of success, some of you guys know we have a really cool platform called Secrets of Success. In fact, you should go to secretsofsuccess.com and go sign up for the newsletter. But today I want to talk about just some of the things that I think are, I don't know, we don't talk enough about those. We talk so much about marketing and business and sales and how to go, you know, get the sale, how to write the script, how to do all sorts of stuff. A lot of times we don't talk about the things that are actually holding us back. I remember one of the first times I had a chance to hang out with Tony Robbins and, you know, Tony's such a giver. You always like asking questions and stuff. And I can't remember exactly what he asked or something around like, you know, like how are people doing, how I get, how he could help and things like that. I said, it's interesting. I'm like, I feel like it's weird for me because I'm teaching everybody the exact same tactics, right? Here's the step-by-step ways to do things. And I'm like, some people have tons of success and a lot of them don't. And I don't understand it and it's frustrating me. And I remember Tony and he kind of laughed. He was like, well, it's the problem, Russell, is that you think that, you know, success is all about the tactics. I'm like, isn't it? He's like, no, no, he's like, he's like, success is like 10% tactical and 90% is psychological. It's the things happening between your ears, your brain. And, you know, if you, if you, uh, how company you are, if you're willing to do these things, if you're, if you're too afraid, like all the kind of things that mostly will struggle with the psychology, not the tactics. He's like, you're one of the best in the world to give people the tactics. But he's like, but the problem people are getting stuck on is the psychology. And I remember after I was like, well, do you want to come speak at my next Funnel Hacking Live event and help people with the psychology? And luckily he said, yes, he's spoken now, I think four of our Funnel Hacking Live events. And the last ever Funnel Hacking Live is coming up soon, Funnel Hacking Live 10. And Tony is doing like a three or four hour long keynote to help, again, help people with their psychology because it's such a big part of it. And so, um, and this episode, I want to talk a little bit more about psychology and about the things in our heads. And, um, when I do these episodes on secrets of success, uh, I'll probably jump around different topics, different ideas. But for this one specifically, I wanted to talk about, uh, a concept called fear. How many of you guys have fear right now? You have fear, uh, fear of success, fear of failure, fear of all my fear, such a big thing, right? And, um, I don't know, I don't, um, it makes me laugh. Uh, a lot of you guys know Annie Grace. Um, she's someone in, uh, my inner circle and my other group. She helps people overcome alcohol addiction. And, uh, anyway, we're having this conversation one time. She's like, Russell, I'm convinced that you don't have an amygdala. I said, right, I don't have any, you don't have an amygdala. I'm like, what's that? She's like, this part of your brain that like, that makes you have fear. She's like, you have no fear. You just go do things all the time. And I kind of laughed. And the reality is I do have fear, um, but I do things anyway. And I started thinking about that. And I was like, what can I help people with that? So many people are struggling with fear. In fact, I'm curious, those of you guys listening right now, how many of you guys is fear? That is the thing that's holding you back and say, like, you just know, like, you want to do the thing, but the fear is holding you back. It's driving you crazy. If so, that's what this show is going to be about is actual fear. Uh, in fact, a lot of you guys know I collect old books and I got this book in the mail, uh, on Friday and I was going through, I got a whole stack of a lot of books. Um, but I found a new author again. I'm always looking for really cool authors in the personal development space. I love like the years like 1897 to like, you know, 1920, that's the window that I love the most. And so this is a, an author named Dr. Frank Crane. If you watch the YouTube version, as you can see, here's a copy of the book. And I was going through, I got like 10 different booklets from him. And this one said fear on the front. It's got this big picture with, I don't know, snakes and a crazy mask. And so for, you know, it kind of jumped out at me. So I always liked just like browse through all the books I get just to get ideas. And the intro of this book was so cool. So I'm going to share this because this is probably where some of you guys are at right now. So it's called fear by Dr. Frank Crane. And this is what he said, it is safe to say that no good work was ever done in fear. Until you have struck the shackles of fear from your hands, you can do nothing. Until you get the grip of fear loose from your minds, your brain is not efficient. And you cannot remember well, think straight, nor imagine constructively until you purge the poison of fear out of your heart, your emotions instead of giving you power and pep will cause you only shame and confusion. Fear is your greatest enemy. It is a ghost. It is nothing at all, but it is no less terrible for all of that. It is the ghost that knocks the cup of success from your lips when you are about to drink. Oh, I love that. Imagine you got a cup of success about to drink. It's his fear. It fears the ghost that knocks the cup of success from your lips. Just when you're about to drink, it is fear that reaches out as ghostly hands to strangle you in crisis. Just when everything depends upon you, it is fear that tangles your feet, hangs down like a millstone around your neck on your journey, dimmed your eyes so you cannot see the truth, roars in your ears until you cannot see the music all about you, thievers your blood, unstrings your nerves and pours its sea nail impotence into your cup of life. You have one big battle that is to conquer fear. That done, the world is yours. Your own will come to you and the stars in their courses will fight for you. What a cool introduction about fear. So fear is the enemy. That's what we have to beat. That's what we have to figure out how to dominate. And so I want to talk about that during this episode because again, for some reason, I have the ability to plow through fear. I don't know exactly why, but these are some of the reasons, some of the lessons I've learned along the way. I've got four from here that kind of walk through and hopefully one or two are all four of these simply to help you guys in your journey so that the cup of success will not be knocked out of your lips as you're about to drink success because I want you guys to be successful in all areas of your life and your business, your family life, your personal life. And so that is kind of the goal and the game plan. Okay, so let's jump right in to ways to overcome fear. And this is not an exhaustive list. Maybe I'll do an episode two later with some other things. These are just the first four I want to talk about today that thought were really impactful and important. All right, number one, you guys ready for this? Number one, as long as you understand that fear and excitement feel the same. Okay, the first time I really understood this, again, you guys know I do funnel hiking live. This is a huge event with 5,000 people. And for whatever reason, every time I'm about to walk out on the stage, I get so much fear and anxiety or I'm sweating. I'm shaking. I'm nervous. Like my stomach's just like in a knot. And I'm like, it's all these things, right? And it's funny people always, you know, the other speakers that thought I'd like to come back and they'll be nervous and they're like, so Russell, when did the nerves go away? I'm like, I don't know. It doesn't happen for me yet. I've been doing this for 20 years. I still get nervous every single time. And I remember I would talk to people. I'm like, I'm so nervous. And so I anxious. I hope it goes well. Like I have all these things. And I remember one time this is like, man, probably four, three or four years ago. Annie Grace was again, he's another Annie conversation, but Annie was speaking on stage and she saw me backstage. She's like, how you doing? I'm like, I'm just nervous and excited. And like, or I'm nervous. I'm like my stomach's tied knots. And, and she pulled me aside. She said, I want you to understand something. She's like, if you look at like what happens inside your body, uh, when you are nervous, so you have fear. And when you're excited, it's literally the same chemical reaction inside your body. Okay. The only difference between being, between fear and excitement is the meaning you are attaching to it. And she's like, instead of when you're going out saying, I'm nervous, I'm so nervous, I'm scared, I'm nervous. Like this thing should just change and say, I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. And I remember like, first I'm like, that's too simple. That's not going to work. You're crazy. But that day later on, I was about to go on stage again and again, all the butterflies and the nerves and like, and I just, I stopped second. Like, I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm excited. And what's crazy is like, it felt like excitement. And I was like, huh, I was like, I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. But it changed like just by changing the meaning of the feeling inside of my head, it changed the experience. Then on stage and it was like, oh, I didn't have, like I was still, I still had fear, but I changed it to excitement and it like the fear and excitement felt the same. Right. And so that was really interesting. It's changed the meaning. And so for me now, it's interesting. Whenever I'm going into a situation and I feel the fear, and you guys know, I don't know what fear feels like to you, but like for me, it's like this knot in my stomach, my hands start sweating. I'm like, cold. I say a cold swell or my cold. I shake almost shaking sometimes because I have shivers, but like I'm also sweating. And I hate that. I hate that feeling. And I just change. I'm like, I'm excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. And it's crazy how just changing the meaning and reattaching the meaning will shift the entire experience for you. I remember going to Tony Robbins date with Destiny and you know, if you haven't been to Destiny yet, it's amazing. I went past probably 14 years ago now because Collette, we just found out she was pregnant with, um, with our son, Aiden. In fact, we hadn't told anybody yet when we were a date with Destiny and Aiden is now 14. So we're there, a date with Destiny and Tony starts talking about, uh, how we have to become masters of the meaning that we attach to things. And he talks about how what happens in, in our brains is like, our brain is always looking for meaning, right? So anything happens is trying to attach a meaning to it. So in the future, what I think happens, then the meaning just shows up like in real time subconsciously, boom, it's there and the meaning shows up. Right. So you walk in the street, someone punches you in the face, right? First of all, you punch the face like, what, what's that? Like, you don't know what's happening, right? And your brain quickly like starts creating a meaning for that. So in the future, you get punched in the face and all of a sudden some punch in the face, like you instantly like your subconscious jumps directly to like, this is a fight. You know, I'm angry. This person that you come back at and you're able to be combative of them instantly, right? Because the meaning is there subconsciously, it just shows up the second you need it. The problem is that most of the time, like our brains, uh, don't always attach the right meaning, but it always starts showing up that way. Right. And so what Tony talked to us like, if somebody punches you, you have to stop for a second and like the first meaning is going to be negative. It's going to create a fight and a battle, right? Versus stopping and say, okay, so then punch me. What's the situation? Let me quickly attach a meaning, but let me figure out situation before I attach a meaning to that thing. Right. And by shifting the meaning, it changes the experience, right? Maybe the person hits you because you were in the way and the fire was coming in and they're trying to get you out of the way. Right. And if you stop for a second, it gives you a window to like, to like actually change the meaning. Now punching is probably not the best example that, um, one of the other things, this was a really cool exercise. This was like life changing for me actually, uh, at the same day with destiny. I remember Tony, um, he wanted us to think about an experience that we had recently, uh, that, that was hard for us. I still remember for me, like what the experience was. My wife and I had had an argument that morning and they were both down at date with destiny. You know, we're sitting in different areas of the room just to sit away from your spouse. And so we're sitting there and, uh, they said, pick a, pick a situation, uh, that made you mad recently. So I was like, Oh, I know exactly what it is. Cause they write that the top of the pad, uh, your pad of paper, right? It's like then draw a big line down the middle. Because then the left hand side is like, I want you to write every single meaning that, um, that you attached to that experience. And I was like, Oh, well, she doesn't love me and she's, you know, I was like, you know, and she's, uh, whatever. And I worked out all different meanings that I attached and it was funny cause it felt good. I was like, Oh, I'm angry about these different things that the meanings I was attaching to this thing, this situation that clad and I had gone through earlier that morning. Right. And so I had a whole list of them and then Tony said, okay, now what you do is on the other side of that line, when we look at the thing you wrote and I want you to write the opposite. Okay. So instead of like, clad doesn't even love me. It's like, man, she loves me so much that whatever, right. And then I figured out the next, the next meeting and then he's like, have you write the opposite? And so I'm writing the opposite of every single thing. And at first I was like, like, this is so stupid. And right. The first one, the second one, and by the third one, I had like that light bulb moment where I was like, Oh my gosh. And I remember actually breaking down in tears and I was like, I was like, all the meanings I attached to that situation that I thought were real, subconsciously they showed up like, right. All the things also stopped. And it was like, none of those meetings were real. And I looked at the opposite and I was like, that's probably actually true. Like, let's scared. She's nervous. She has fear. She has these things, right? And it was the exact opposite meaning. And, uh, and that was like life changing for me. And, you know, learning from Tony was like, you have to become a master at, at meaning, like attaching the correct meaning because, um, two different things can happen and the different meaning you attach will change everything. In fact, I remember one story he told, I told the story about there were two people who come to, I don't know if it was date with destiny or UPW, I can't remember the exact details. I'll probably mess this story up, but the, the, the, um, hopefully the, the story, like the, the meaning behind this will hopefully come out correct. But he said that there were two people who were both at, um, UPW and both of them had served in Vietnam, I believe. And, um, and what, and both of them, uh, at Vietnam had friends who were shot and had died while they were there, right? And they had a chance. They, they had witnessed the death of their, their, um, like one of their friends at, in Vietnam. And he said, what was crazy is that now this was like whatever 30, 40 years later, one man was very successful, had a lot of, you know, really positive things happening. One person had a really horrible, really hard, really bad life. And he was interviewing both of them. And he said that, um, do you think about both of them 40 years earlier, whatever it was, it both had had almost the exact same, um, situation happened, right? Both of them were holding a friend, got shot in Vietnam, both like, both of them had held their friend while they had died in their arms and just had this thing, right? And one of them attached the meaning that, um, I can't believe my friend died. People are so cruel. This is what human beings, this is what human beings are like, right? And attached that meaning where the other friend said, man, I can't let my friend die. Life is so short. I got to make sure I live to the best of my abilities. Right. And so like same situation, different meaning. And now you look 40 years later, like how different, um, those two experiences, like one person was because they're like, man, life is short. I got to make meaning. I got to like have relationships. I can build this beautiful life because that situation where somebody else said, man, people are bad, people are cold, people, people are ruthless, had built a whole different thing. Right. So it's looking at these two completely different situations. All based on the meaning that was attached. Okay. So fear, like number one here is like we've come really good at attaching meaning correctly. So when you have fear, just realize that the, the, um, the, what's happening inside your body, the chemicals, the feeling, all that kind of stuff is the same with fear and excitement. And only the difference is the meaning you're attached to. The very first thing is learning how to attach the correct meaning to something. Okay. If you attach the meaning to fear, you're going to be fearful. If you take your path, you attach the meaning of excitement, it's going to make you excited. It'll take you out of completely different paths. So step number one is changing the meaning from fear to excitement. Okay. Step number two, uh, you have to become okay with the worst case scenario. Um, I see so many people get stuck inside of fear because they're scared to death of the worst case scenario. Now the story behind this, I remember, um, I'm a friend, his name is Chad Wolner. He's a chiropractor and, uh, Chad, um, I met him probably, uh, over a decade ago now. And, um, he was a great chiropractor, came out of chiropractor college. He worked for somebody for a while and he watched the start of the business, started on the business, launched it, you know, did all that you bought the, bought the chair and the, the office and like spent a lot of money building out his practice and they tried to launch it. It wasn't going really well. And he kept trying different things to market it. He was trying, he was running different ads, like all sorts of stuff and just struggling and struggling and struggling. And we became friends during this time. So we had to know each other and we would talk about business back and forth a little bit. Uh, and then one day I got the call, right? Uh, it was probably 10 o'clock at night, maybe 11 o'clock at night and he called me. He was in tears. He's like, Hey, I've tried everything. He's like, we're about to go bankrupt. Like I can't afford the bills. No one's coming in. He's like, dude, you're the best marketing guy in the world. You're my friend. Do you mind just like coming in and just like, like, give me like, tell me what you would do if you were in the situation. And I was like, Oh man, no stress. No, you know, I was a little nervous. I'm like, yeah, I'd love to. So we go to his office. I guess like 10, 30, 11 o'clock at night this time. And, um, and I think he was waiting for me to wait for some magic one. Like, Oh, here's the secret funnel. Here's the secret thing. And I started asking some questions and things like that. And when I realized that he was so stuck with fear, like fear was so tight that he was not able to move forward. And, um, and I realized after talking to him for 15, 20 minutes, I was like, I don't have a secret marketing thing I can give him. I was like, what I can give him is like, he has to become okay with the worst case scenario. I said, um, and I told him stories about myself. I had the same thing where until I was okay with the worst case scenario, I couldn't move forward. I said, okay, well, we'll chat. What's, what's the worst case scenario? Let's say that like this whole thing collapses and like business fails. Like what is it? What's the worst case scenario? It was like worst case scenario. I go bankrupt. I was like, okay, write that down. You go bankrupt. I was like, okay, what does that mean? Like what's the word? I feel bankrupt. Like what's so bad about that? He's like, well, if I go bankrupt, then, you know, my, uh, I don't know. I can't remember. But I may in law, so think less of me. Okay, write that down in laws. Like, uh, if I go bankrupt, I lose my house. I can write that down. You lose your house. And I'm going to, uh, you have to go and like off the move to a different area of town, maybe different city, keep to move. And then your kids won't go to the school they're going to. And like, we list out every single one of the worst case scenarios. If you go bankrupt, it's the worst case scenario. And we sat down and I had this whole list of everything. I said, okay, now we got to go through these things. I mean, number one, you go bankrupt, you lose your house. Mike, I mean, or it's the number one is bankrupt. Like, then when you go bankrupt, like, like who cares? The founding fathers of our country gave us the bankruptcy laws so that entrepreneurs would have the ability to risk. Like most successful entrepreneurs, I know have gone through bankruptcy at least once a couple of multiple times before they became before they had success. So worst case scenario, you're like all the other great entrepreneurs of all time and you went bankrupt. I'm like, are you okay with that? Could you like, could you survive and you go bankrupt? He's like, okay, like, okay, I can do that. Right. And I go to the next thing. Okay. Next thing is that, um, you're going to lose your house. I'm like, who cares? Like your house is, I'm like, your house is great, but like, there are better houses. Like you lose a house. Like, you know, we went through like, okay, if you lose houses, you're okay. Okay. Then went through the in-laws and then went through that with every single thing. The time we were done, I was like, okay, so worst case scenario, all the things that you came with those kind of those worst case scenarios is like, actually, yeah, I guess worst case, like I could deal with all those things. I'm like, okay, now, like, now you look at the worst case scenario. Now you got to run forward as fast as you can. Right. Like we, I took like, again, most people are so scared of the worst case scenario that they can't move. Like fears is tight. Like, like grab them. They can't move. And it was interesting because, um, uh, uh, after that, like it was, it was cool because then he started running and then he, he literally saves his own practice. It wasn't like some marketing secret. I just helped him to like, to overcome fear, like to be okay with the worst case scenario. Um, I think a lot of people, it's like, you know, the worst case scenario, but you're trying to think about it. Try to be positive. Don't think about it. So you just like, you block it off. So it doesn't come out there. And it's like, instead you have to stop and you have to look at it directly and stare in the eye, stare that fear. So the worst case scenario in the eyes, look at every single thing, list them out, write a piece of paper, every single thing, and then you'll come okay with that worst case. I get that. I get that. I get that. Okay. I'm okay with that. I'm okay with that. You go through all the worst case scenarios and it's like, okay, I can deal with that. Now you're free. Now you can run forward. Okay. Another good example of you guys have seen, um, the third Batman, uh, the one with the Banes in it. Um, there's a really cool, uh, story. If you, I mean, all of Batman or do you know what he's talking about? Like, um, or Batman, like Bane breaks his back and throws him in this pit where, you know, only one person's ever escaped from the pit and they have to go and they have to like, if you remember, like, you have to like climb up this thing. You have to jump to try to like climb out of the pit, but everyone who tries falls and they fall to their death and they fall and they break their, you know, whatever. And they, no one's ever made it except for one person's only made it. And, uh, so Batman's trying for, for a whole bunch of time. He's trying and trying and trying and every single time he fails. And I can't remember, I spent a while since I've watched the movie. Um, but basically what happens then day is he realizes he's like the rope. So what do you do is he's tied a rope around his waist. So that worst case scenario, if he jumped and he missed it, he wouldn't die. Right. So he's jumping and like falling on this from this rope and it's just like jacking his body and everything. And so finally he realizes, in fact, I think they asked like the one person that, they actually escaped. What do they do? It's they jumped without the rope. And so he decides he takes the rope off and he goes last time he jumps and he actually makes it. Right. And what happens is like that, that thing, the worst case scenario, that thing holding him back, right. The rope that was there to protect him, um, kept him from leaping as hard as he needed to go. When he didn't have that rope and he had to go a hundred percent, right. Cause there's no other options. Then he succeeded and got out of the pit. Okay. The same thing's true with us. Like we have to like cut the rope, look back worst case scenario. I'm okay with that. And now we can go forward. Okay. So step number two to be, to really smash fear is you got to become okay with the worst case scenario. And this is hard. All times it's looking at those things like, man, that would suck. That would be horrible. Okay. But if it happens, I'm going to be okay with that. Right. You got to become okay with the worst case scenario. Okay. All right. So that's number two. Number three, um, number stage thing. And I actually heard that Sean Stevenson, um, is a friend I had who passed away, uh, a couple years ago. Uh, he was a speaker and he used to speak at big events and he's that he actually spoke in the second ever funnel hacking live. They called him the three feet giant. Uh, he's this little kind of dude. He's awesome. I had missed Sean. He was, uh, hey, one of the coolest guys ever. Uh, but anyway, he was, he was, um, he did a course on public speaking. Uh, it's just a great speaker and I remember listening to it and he said something that at first I, like it's funny because at first it bothered me because it, because I, again, I would always speak at stage. I still got nervous, still got nervous. And he said something in his presentation. He said, or the course he had, he said that, if you have fear when you're speaking, he's like, the problem is that you're focusing on you and not them. He's like, when you're focusing on your audience, you're not going to be scared. When you're focusing on you, that's when you have fear. Right. Cause you think about that when fear is coming, it's like, I have fear because what if I make, make a mistake or I look stupid or I decrease my status, right? All these different things, right? All the things you're happening that's creating fears because you're focusing on you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, right? He said, when you're focusing on them and the audience, how do I serve them? How do I help them? Like, and you start shifting your focus from you to them, then fear goes away. And I remember again, I was, I, I, I hated that. I did not want to believe him because I was just like, no, I still get scared. Like I'm focusing on, I'm focusing on serving them, but, um, I, I didn't realize it for a couple of years that how right he was when I shifted from like, I want to give a really good presentation so that I look good. He was talking about me to like, all right, these are my people. This is what I'm called to serve. How do I, how do I get through them? How do I help them? How do I serve? Like one of the things I'm going to get like, I was so focused on them. Understanding and, and getting the thing I need to get from them, where I've shifted the focus to that, the fear, the anxiety lifted, um, and it changed everything. So, um, understanding that if you are still feeling those fear, it's because you're worried too much about you. Um, in fact, it's one of the worst case scenarios. Like I'm going to, I'm going to feel stupid. I lower my status, like all those kinds of things where versus shifting, like, okay, I'm building a business, I'm speaking, I'm doing whatever the thing is you're trying to do. Like it's about them. It's about the people I'm serving and you focus on that and shift folks from you. It goes away. Right. Think about like, if, if you were like, listen to the, all the stuff in your head that's going crazy when you're trying to do something, right? All of the, all of the, the chatter in your brain, if you actually stopped and I started writing out what you're, what you're doing, like, what's the chatter? She's like, what if I look stupid? What if I trip? What if I, uh, whatever, what if I, my words look about right? What if I talk too fast? What if I stumble? What if I, blah, blah, blah, you know, it's like those things that this causing the spirit anxiety versus like, I'm here. I'm a, you know, I'm a conduit for God. Like I'm supposed to talk and share some of these people. I'm just going to focus on them and the right things will show up. And you know, if I mess up, like, you know, you make that shift, it's, it's crazy. Um, and so whenever you have fear, start focusing more on, on the people you're serving than yourself and the fear will subside. Okay. Now, number four, but this was going to be a little hard for some of you guys. Sometimes you got to do it scared. Sometimes you got to do it through fear. Okay. Feeling is going to be there. Right. It's going to keep showing us when you popping up. Sometimes you got to do it scared and it's hard. The key to this though is like practice, practicing and practicing and practicing. I think about this, like, um, like again, I was playing that, that, um, and he said that I've got a no amygdala. Like, you have no amygdala. How are you able to stick to go? You know, fear, I have fear. But the reality is like, I've, I've stepped into the fear so many times. I stepped into the fire so many times that I'm okay with it. Right. I think about myself like I was a, I was a wrestler growing up, right? I was a wrestler in college, in high school, in college. I was a state champion in high school. I was an all-American or an all-American in high school, uh, ranked the top 10 in college. Um, and so you look at that, like every single year I would have, you know, during the season, I have 40, 45 matches during the off season. I have a hundred matches. I have like 150 or so matches a year for a decade. So it's like what 1500 or so matches before every match. So much fear. So it's like consistently every single night, especially wrestling good guys. You all look across the thing, you see that and like, look at it. Both guys are warming up. We're staring each other, trying to stare each other down, trying to act all tough, trying to like, you know, just try to intimidate the person. You come out, shake their hand, trying to be intimidated, intimidating, right? The whole time you're just like so much fear and anxiety. Right. I remember before a match, like I get so sick to my stomach. I'm warming up, I'm stretching and so look at the other guy and just like all the thing. But as soon as they said your name, all right, Russell Brunson, your match number two and like, and then the match in front of you gets done. Like, like you had to walk out. You didn't have an option. Right. Like the guy gets pinned, the match hand gets over and also my name pops up on the screens. It's like, I have to go. So wrestling, I'm taking my, you know, I have a single underneath my sweats. I take my shirt off, take my sweatpants off and I walk out there and I shake hands and whistle blows and you go. There's no, there's no like waiting and you know, it's like, you have to go. I think about this. I don't know if you guys do clip jumping. I used to do a lot more of it until last time, probably we were Pirates of the Cove from my Atlas group and I jumped off a 40-foot thing and smacked my ear and I couldn't hear. Anyway, I had all sorts of weird things. So I probably don't clip jump now very much. But when I would clip jump, so I found like, um, and Pirates of the Cove, he hadn't been there before, it's one of the best places, but there's, it's just big pirate houses, insane. And in the middle, there's this big, huge pool at the bottom and then, and then there's this pirate mass that goes up about 40 feet. And so you have to climb up this mass, you're climbing, you're climbing, it gets higher and higher. And then there's like, there's three levels and then the top level is called the crow's nest. And there's a big, like fake skeleton, guarding crow's nest that says, you can't go beyond this point. Do not go up here. And so like to get past me, it's like, climb behind this thing where you're like dangling, barely holding on to climb past this like big skeleton warning you from going up there. And you climb into the, the crow's nest at the top and you get up there and you step there and like the wind blows and this thing is moving like rocking back and forth and back and forth. You look down, you see this huge pool of water way down the bottom, but the pool seems so tiny. You're like, if I jump and the wind blows a little bit, I'm going to smack into the rocks, right? Like it's that kind of scary thing. And what I found is like, if I stand up there, the longer I stood up there looking, the harder it was, I stabbed there and it's like, Oh my gosh, I'm going to die. I could hit that. I could hit that. I'm so nervous. I'm so scared. And like, and I had times I sit there for 10, 15, 20 minutes, I couldn't go because it's just like so much fear, so much anxiety. He was like, ah, right. What I found was like, if I was going to go clip jumping, I couldn't think about it. So I would go, I climb, I climb, I climb the crow's nest. I get to see the skeleton. I climb behind to get up top, I get the tops and looked over the top and run and jump. Like if I thought for a second, it would just slow everything down, right? I had to do it scared. I had to do it anywhere. I just had to go, right? The longer I sat there thinking about it, the harder it was to do the wrestling was nice. I had no time to think about it. Like as soon as it pop up, like Russell, you know, Russell Brunson, you're up like, I had to go. There's no way I can, I can just wait inside and out like, Oh, I'm nervous. Oh, I'm nervous. I'm nervous. I'm going to clip jumping. I can sit there being nervous for a long time, right? Send the ice bath. How many guys ice bath? The ice baths, one of the worst things in the world and one of the best things in the world at the same time, right? It's so, I don't know about you, but it sucks every single time. And so when I pull the top of my ice bath off, I took my shirt off and get down to my, to my, uh, whatever. If I, if I hesitate for 10 seconds, then I'm hesitating for 10 minutes. Right. But as soon as I, as soon as I take my shirt off, pants, you know, pants come off. I got my tighties on or whatever. And then I just got to go, I have to go immediately in. And if I do that, then I'm fine. But it's like, if I hesitate for 10 seconds, it's over. Okay. And so for, I've clumped jumping off cliff, I can't hesitate. Ice baths, I cannot hesitate. Um, also I started doing peptides this year. And you guys have peptides. If you have it, peptides are amazing. There's so many cool use cases by taking peptides for two or three things. The only problem with peptides is the peptide, you have to give yourself a shot. Okay. I am scared to death of needles. So the very first time I had to give myself a shot, I get my peptide, you get my thing in there, I check it all out. And then, um, you can give shots in place of, I'm going to give this, I'm going to give a shot in my stomach. So I pinched my little stomach and I sat there and I was like, okay. Took me over an hour, took me an hour to sit there just to like, finally do it. And I was like, that was horrible. I got to do it again tomorrow. Oh, okay. So tomorrow I go down there, same day. I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, you know, five minutes, 10 minutes, 25 minutes. And my wife's like mocking me. She's like, Russell, you're such a worst. She grabs her boom, shoots it in two seconds. She's done. And so for me, I was like, okay, I got to do the scare. I just got to do it. The longer I wait, the longer, you know, the more painful it's going to be. And so I thought about clip jumping. If I, if I get up there, I just have to jump. Ice baths, as soon as I'm able, I jump right in, right? Same thing. So for me right now, but hepatitis, I go and I fill up the syringe. I turn it around. I put the alcohol wipe on your stomach and boom, I just jam it in instantly. I don't think, and then I don't think fear. There's no fear, no chance for fear to show up. Okay. And so sometimes you got to just do it scared. You just got to do it. Like stop thinking and worrying and all that kind of stuff. Right. And so those are the things I want to share with you guys again. There's a lot more things to overcome fear, but for me, those are the things that, that have meant the most case. Number one, I understand that fear and excitement are the same feeling cycle or not psychologically, but inside your body, chemically inside your body, it is the exact same thing, things happening. And you got to become good at attaching the correct meaning, changing the meaning from fear to change it to excitement. And that will like, that's a huge, simple thing you can do. Number two, you got to become okay with the worst case scenario. Look at again, making a list of all the worst case scenarios. If you fail, what does that look like? Look at all of those and go line at them by line at them by line at them. Becoming okay with the worst case there. I can do that worst case there. I can do that. I can live with that. I can live with that. And so usually you're okay with the worst case scenario. It'll unbind you and give you the ability to move forward. Number three, I understand that fear all comes to your focusing on you, you, you, you, you, right? And in your business, in your life, if you're focusing on who you are serving, it'll take that fear and it'll take the pressure off when you start focusing on them and not focusing on you. And then number four, sometimes you got to do it scared. You got to go out there and just jump off the cliff, jump into the ice bath, give yourself this shot, take the thing, just do it. Just don't sit there thinking about thinking about like worrying about it. Right? You just got to jump. And it's going to be uncomfortable, but it's the thing. It's the secrets, the thing is going to get you to be successful. So those you guys are, um, those four things, there's four ways to overcome fear that I think will be helpful. Those are the core four things I do. Again, we'll probably do fear episode number two someday in the future, but those are the core, the core things that all came again from the Reena's book, fear, uh, by Dr. Frank Crane back in, I think this is published in 19, 1921. So I believe that all the best writing happened from like the 1900s to 1920s. Like that's kind of my, that's the era that I love the right and the most, but, um, just, uh, just a couple of things that again, for me says until you purge the poison of fear out of your heart, your emotions, instead of giving you power and PEP will cause you only shame and confusion. Okay. So you got to purge the poison of fear out of our hearts. Um, it says this ghost of fear is the knocks the cup of success from your lips just when you're about to drink, right? Don't let it knock the cup of success. Like just go and drink it again. Don't hesitate and wait and wait that fear. You're going to miss your shot. Right. Just take the drink. And then this is, um, this is, it pours its senile impotence in the cup, in your cup of life. Right. Like that's how bad fears and says you have one big battle is to conquer fear with that done. The world is yours. Your own will come to you and the stars in their courses will fight for you. So overcoming fear, you guys, it is the key because again, like Tony Robbins said initially, right? Like, like 10% of this is tactical. Like you guys have my books. I got dot com secrets, experts secrets, traffic secrets, all the tactics you need. Right. It's the psychology. It's like getting rid of fear so you can do the thing is one of the big keys a lot of us are missing. So with that said, you guys, um, I want to help you as overcome fear. So I hope these four things help, um, feel free to listen to this episode again to go through those things and start going through them. Right. Figure out how you can attach different meanings. What's the worst case there? I got to be okay with that. How do I shift my fear of focusing on me to focusing on them? And then how do I just do it scared? How do I jump off the cliff, jump into the ice, whatever it takes for you just to do it and we overcome those things. It'll change everything for you.
