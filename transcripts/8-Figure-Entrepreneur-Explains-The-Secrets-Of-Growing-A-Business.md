What's up everybody? This is Russell. Welcome back to the show. Excited to be hanging out with you guys today. And today we're going to be talking about getting insane amounts of traffic to your funnel before your funnel is even live. This is one of the biggest problems I'm seeing inside of our community is people, they are spending time building a funnel, or building an offer, or putting things together, but they're not focusing on the most important thing, which is planning all the seed genie ahead of time, before you actually launch your funnel. So that's what we're going to talk about. We're going to go deep into it. For any of you guys who are building but not getting the eyeballs that leads the following ahead of time, we're going to fix that for you guys today and show you a very fun, simple way to do that. But before we do, I got to start with some stories because, anyway, I'm enjoying the new podcast style and you guys have been telling me some fun. I've shared a lot of stories. Again, like I used to act in the day and people are loving it. So I'm going to tell you some stories that will hopefully motivate you and get you excited. One story is the fact this shirt I'm wearing today. I saw this on the Joe Rogan show. He had an honor with podcast episodes. I'm hoping that by default, me wearing this, our podcast will grow. So there you go. There's number one. No, but for real, the story I want to tell you guys today, it was one, it was actually, I looked way too much at the trainer and I can't remember what conversation we got in, but we started talking about this and this story popped in my head. I hadn't thought about this in like probably 20 years and I thought it was really funny. So this comes down to like, I don't know, my number one, I took strength finders. My number one strength is competition. Like I love competition. I thrive in it. The more that it is, the better it is and all sorts of stuff. And, you know, that's why this business has been so fun for me. You know, we first launched it. We were the underdogs and we had this big competition. We had all these companies to take on funding. I remember lead pages when we first decided to create ClickFunnels, they had to take on $5 million in funding. Eventually they had like 40. And so I was like, we got to beat them. So we were racing to beat them because we had no funding. It was just us with our brains and our like intuition and our energy running. So that was like the initial thing that we went through, right? And eventually we beat them. We surpassed them. And I have not heard the word lead pages in, I don't know, five, six, seven years. The next was like, okay, who's the next company? It was like, boom, it was Infusionsoft. They just got like $150 million in funding. So like, all right, there's the next goal. So they're racing, racing, racing. And it was interesting. So that was kind of the goal. And then for a long time we were the top and there was no one to compete against. And for me, like, I need competition. And so that's, I think, big reason why we decided to build the new ClickFunnels, which by the way, you guys can see the logo. If you watch the video version, there's a logo blown up. We just this week launched the brand new ClickFunnels brand. Have you guys seen it yet? It is insane. It is the coolest thing ever. I need to get a light like this now with the new branding. But it's coming soon. We actually did order lights. We have a new brand here in light format for the, for the videos, but the new brand is going to amazing. The Apple is awesome. The software looks awesome. It's so exciting. With all these people now who have, who are like re-logging back into ClickFunnels this season, we have to start using it. In fact, Joe McCall, one of my favorite people on planet, he posted today, said, I'm digging into the new ClickFunnels more seriously. And let me tell you something, it's flipping amazing. We're bringing all of our funnels back over. It's way better than GHL. What was that, Joe? It's way better than GHL. Thanks, Russell Brunson. Love your dedication to making marketing world a better place. Seriously. Okay. So speaking of what Joe said, there was competition and this competition came out hard and fast against us. And I'm not going to lie. We lost the first round. We lost the first period. And, but I'm a wrestler. Like we don't, we don't just stop, right? And so for us, it's been like mounting our defense, mounting new strategy, mounting new play, getting software better, like all the different things. And now it's like, this is the year of momentum. Like things are rolling forward. It's been really fun. And so anyway, so in that context is where this story kind of came from. So I do remember the kid's name. I'm not going to say his name, but this is a kid who elementary school, I went to school with him, knew he was, thought I was a friend with him. He got into high school, you know, high school people become like annoying. So anyway, I was not the best football player, but I was on the football team. And I remember, anyway, I remember the, I was like third string safety or something like that. I remember our coaches were like, all right, guys, you got to find the guy ahead of you and beat him out. And it's like, they gave us really good presentation. I got motivated. I'm like, okay, I'm going to find the guy ahead of me. I'm going to beat him out. So the next two weeks, I kept like working, working and killing myself. And then it beat him, the guy that was, that was like the second string safety. And then the first string and then it beat him the first guy. And I was so excited. I'm like, getting in competition drives me. I'm like, this is the thing. And so I told my parents, like, I'm going to be playing the game and be starting. I'm so excited. And so that, that day is the football game. We're there. We're on the field warming up. And one of the other coaches came over and was like, Brunson, what are you doing here? I'm like, I beat, I'm very proud. Like I beat the guys out. Like I made, I made the starting team. And he looked to me and he's like, and he looked over one of the backup quarterbacks. And he's like, Hey, get over here. And he like put him in my spot and button me out. And that's when I started hating team sports, by the way. I'm very much like that's how the conversation came up with, with my trainer is like, I'm like, I'm a combat athlete. Notice the, you know, hence the cauliflower. You're like, I love wrestling with UFC love fighting with combat. Like not a big fan of team sports can't stand watching him and get bored by him. But this is probably a big reason because like I killed myself. And then because of the politics of a team sport, I got bumped out, which was frustrating me. Right. So anyway, after that, I decided like, I'm not a football player. If I can bump me because of that, like, I don't want to play this game. I finished out that season, but I focused all my effort on wrestling, the greatest sport in the world. And within a year became a state champion in high school took second place in the nation. Went on got a D1 scholarship and so on and so forth. Right. So that was kind of my shift. Now this is where the story gets fun. So that year of playing football, I remember after I beat out, we went to this, we went to some, we're playing some away game, we played this game and we got destroyed. Like our team, our team got killed and I'm on the sidelines waiting to play. I think I played maybe one play the entire game, which is so stupid. So play one game and we get done and we're like leaving. I'm just like, this is so like, why am I doing this? I remember I was thirsty. So I grabbed a thing of water and I started drinking it and there's this kid getting went to elementary school with him, thought we were friends and he sees me drinking it. And he's like, he's like, bruntz why are you getting drink water? You didn't even play this game or something. And I was like, you know, as a ninth grader, whatever, like humiliated and embarrassed for all these people. I was just like, oh, like broke me, you know, and I was like, I freaking hate that guy. Anyway, but that like got the like, okay, I got to win. Anyway, then fast forward, this guy moved schools. I don't see him again. I'm like, kind of forget about him. Then a couple years later, it's, I swear the story's got a point, but it's fun. A couple years later, I come back and where it's, it's a junior year in high school or something. And during the Christmas break, we did crossover practice with with another high school. So the other high school came to our room and one day we went to their rooms for two days with these guys. And when they show up to our wrestling room, I look over and that kid still knows name. He was there. He's on the other team. He transferred schools and he's on the wrestling team. And I was like, oh, yes. And all the memories of him knocking the water out of my hand, all kinds of stuff was like, I was like, this is it. And so we start the practice, I'm like him, I'm going to go with him. And I was going, he's like, oh, hey, Brunson, how you doing? I'm like, yeah, I'm doing good. And so for the next three hours of wrestling practice, my only plan was to destroy him mentally and physically. And I did by the time it was done, we were about two thirds of the practice. He got up, he's like, I have to leave or I'm going to, I'm going to try to fight you or something. I just laugh. I like to see you try. I just beat you like a baby for the last anyway. So he walked off and left the next day with a chance to go to their high school. I'm like, you're my partner again. And he was like so mad. And I just, anyway, it was, it was a great day in the, in a great two days in the life of Russell to come back and have that kind of payback. So anyway, that's the mindset you have to have when you're going off to competition competitors, right? It's looking at that and like, okay, how do we win? What does it look like? When somebody knocks you down, it's like, all right, new strategy, new game plan, what does it look like? I start putting the pieces together. So I'm excited because the last couple of years has been brutal. As you guys knew from the first video, I, I, the first podcast steps that I talk about, but what's been fun is it's finally gotten like me, the competition backwards. Like, okay, how do I win? Instead of like, how do I survive? How do we do everything? No, no, no, how do we win? What's that look like? How does it, how does the strategy have to change? And I tell you what, man, it is lit me on fire. And a lot of people tell me, Russell, we feel this momentum coming from you and from click thoughts. What's happening? I was like, oh, you'll see. If you're feeling it now, just wait. We're just getting started. So I'm excited for this year and it's been fun. So, all right. So what I promise you as we're talking about during this episode, this is one of the biggest things I see. Okay. People come to my world. They read the books. They start studying, start learning. They start building funnels. They start building offers and printing together. And there's a process, right? Is you're trying to, you first start learning this game. Like, you got to figure out like, okay, first off, I, I had to convince you that you are an expert, right? If you're going to be in the expert business, I got to convince you, you got to create products and make, there's all these things that go into it, right? And it takes a lot for you to create the product, create the things. And so what I see a lot of times is people get so stuck over here and like, okay, I'm building, like, I'll see him at an event like, oh, I'm building a funnel. I'm building a funnel. I'm like, cool. Building a funnel is very important. It's my favorite thing in the world. I get it. But at the same time, like, are you also like gathering the people? Okay. And this is where people mess up, mess up, right? And a lot of times I'll spend a month, six months a year, whatever, building the funnel, building the product, whatever. And then when they're finally done, they're like, okay, I'm going to share it with the world and there's no one to share it with. This is a mistake people make. Okay. So the second you decide you want to be an entrepreneur, okay? The second you decide you're like, I want to be an entrepreneur, I want to sell stuff. Like, that's when this, like, this is step one that's happened. Step two is like creating an offer, building a business. Like step one is you have to start gathering the many. Okay. You hear me talk a lot about like one of the many presentations. Like what is a one of many presentation, right? It's me gathering many people together and I deliver presentation to them to sell them something, right? So it could be a webinar, it could be a challenge, some, some type of funnel that gets the people where I can sell them something, right? So what we need to do is we gather the many. There's a lot of ways to gather the many, right? One way is through paid ads. So right now we are in the middle of a selling online event. The second line event, we, we got a little over 3,700 people registered for that event. So I gathered 3,700 people together. Okay. But my cost to gather those people where it was like $300 or so to sell $100 ticket, right? So it cost me almost a million. It's like $925,000 for me to gather those people together, 3,700 people to deliver presentation. Now from that, we will make, well, I don't, we'll, we'll 3x our return on our ad spend, right? Like we'll 3x the money we made by doing that, right? But it cost me a lot of money to gather those people through paid ads, right? And so a lot of people think, I think when they think, when this is my funnel, I'm going to go and like, and like, then I'll go find the audience, right? But then that's like the most expensive, especially if you've been doing this and you're bootstrapping this, like the most expensive thing initially is to go pay for ads and get people in, right? So the question is like, well, how do I, how do I gather the many ahead of time so that when I go and I, and I'm ready to launch the thing, but the audience is already gathered. I don't gotta go spend a million dollars to gather these people. Like how do I do it ahead of time, right? And there's so many things you can and should be doing that you're probably not thinking about right now. And that's what I want to talk about, okay? Is what are the things you can do to start gathering the many right now. So the second your product, your funnel is done, right? Then the many are already there. You're not like going out like, okay, I depleted my resources building this business. Now I got to go spend money to, to get the customers, right? Like, no, the second you decide I want to be an entrepreneur, that's when you start planting these seeds. That's when you start gathering the people instantly, right? So for a lot of you guys, if you missed it, like if you've been doing this for a week or a month or a year or five years, and you haven't done this yet, like, this is now your number one focus. More important than building your funnel or creating your offer or anything, your number one focus is this, which is starting to gather the many. So the second you've done, you've got to, a captive audience. Because if you're, if you're waiting for your funnel to be done before you capture an audience, you messed up. Okay? That's the wrong order. You're out of order. So we got to get back into the correct order. Does that make sense? Okay, so that's what I'm going to talk about. Now I'm going to quote a couple of things from my book, Traffic Secrets. This is not a blatant pitch for traffic secrets, but if it was a blatant pitch, I'd tell you to go get a free copy at trafficsecrets.com. But inside this, this is my book to teach you how to get traffic and build a following and all sorts of stuff. Like it's, it's the deep dive of my brain. There's a couple of pieces in here that I do want to share with you guys that I think are key to understanding this, right? And so I'm just going to jump around. If you got the book, you can open with me. If not, just listen to my stories or if you want to get a book or you can go to Amazon, get for 25 bucks or whatever it is, or you can get for free plus shipping at trafficsecrets.com. Okay. So secret number four inside a Traffic Secrets book. The chapter is called Work Your Way and Buy Your Way in, right? So I'm talking about there's two different ways to, to grow an audience, right? Again, buying your way in is buying at. That's what I did with this weekend. I gave Zuckerberg $900,000 to, to, to buy my way in, to get him to send the whole bunch of people to my, to me, so I can sell for them, right? Or you can work your way in. Working your way in is how you get free traffic to come to you, right? A lot of people ask me, what's better, free traffic or paid traffic? The reality is they're both insanely awesome. I love them both, right? There's not one better, but when most people are getting started, usually you've got one, you got two different resources, either time or you have money, right? These are the two resources that we have. And what I tell people traditionally is if you have more money than time, focus on paid ads. But if you have more time than money, you got to focus on working your way in, doing the free stuff. Okay. Again, in a perfect world, you'll be doing both. In fact, if you read the Traffic Secrets book, we walk you through the process of starting free and then reinvesting money from free into paid ads. And that's how you actually scale in a way that's not scary. In fact, on page 68, I have this little graph. I don't know if you can see that at all. There it is. So there's like this traffic in time and like it shows like control traffic, you're buying, you can spike really fast. And at flat lines, where's earned traffic is slower, but then it scales past it eventually. So that's kind of like, anyway, that's, that's how we look at long term. But right now I just want to focus on working our way and getting the traffic ahead of time because it's the free traffic and stuff you can and should be doing while you're building your business. Okay. All right. So in, in secret number four, work away and buy a win. The first step here are the steps as dig your well before you're thirsty. Okay. So this is what I'm talking about. You want to start digging your well before you're thirsty. So what that means is when your funnel is done, your offer is done, you're going to be thirsty and eat traffic and eat traffic. I need to be able to sell to you. And I was just like, oh crap, I didn't dig my well. Okay. That's the secret eggs. We got to start digging our well before we're thirsty. Okay. We start building the following before we have something to sell to them. Step number one is building the following step number one is traffic. Right. And somebody asked me, I remember I was speaking in the UK and I still remember an image. Gee, she was awesome. And speaking in the UK, I come off and we're talking in this little group of people and somebody asked me, I think it was her or someone's with her, something, but they asked me like, Russell, when you launch a funnel, it's always successful. How are you always successful? And it was the first time I'd ever given the, I didn't, I didn't consciously think about this, but the first time I'd ever like, I responded. I was like, oh wow. And I was like, I thought for a second. I'm like, oh, the reason why is because I don't build a funnel first thing. I'll look for traffic. I find the traffic source first and then I build a funnel and an offer based on what that, that traffic actually wants. And the person was like, what, why don't you tell everyone that? Like that was the big secret. I was like, I hadn't thought about it, like, but it makes, like that's what I do, but I hadn't thought about it. Right. A lot of people, what you're doing is you're building a funnel and building an offer and then trying to find traffic to sell to. Okay. The secret is finding the traffic source first and then you create the offer that they actually want. Then it becomes easy. It's just flipping the order of things. Right. Step one, step two. A lot of you guys are going to step two right now as opposed to step and warm. Okay. So dig your well before you're thirsty. And so the concept that's like before you need the traffic this time, before you need the relations, before you need someone to promote, that's when you start building a relationship. Right. Like I remember when I first met Tony Robbins, like eventually I wanted Tony to promote something for me. Right. Hey Tony, you're from me. Right. That's me asking for water without digging your well. Right. Instead, I was like, I'm going to build a relationship with Tony Robbins. So for a decade, I built a relationship with Tony. Right. I was digging my well, digging my own building relationship and 10 years later, when my second book came out, expert seekers was like, Hey Tony, you promote this? He's like, I would love to need a Facebook live with me. Like I've seen by like 5 million people sold 10,000 plus copies of my book. Right. And it all came off of me digging my well before I was thirsty. Okay. And so that's the first thing I'm thinking about. I was like, you're going to be thirsty as soon as your funnel is done, you're going to be thirsty for traffic. Now is the time to start digging today, not tomorrow, not next week, not like today. Right. That's step number one. The second study, the entrepreneur is starting digging your well, starting to get the people starting to start building the following. Right. So you should be thinking every single day, you should be blocking at least an hour to two hours a day just in like digging the well. Right. So that when you have the offer done, it's ready. Does that make sense? So step one is digging your well before you're thirsty. And then in here, I talk about different ways to do that. And there's a lot of stuff in here. But, but there's kind of two sides I'm going to talk about. One is publishing and then one is actually building relationships with people who already have your traffic source. Okay. So I'm going to go kind of touch on both sides of those a little bit. I'll start with the, the finding people who already have your dream audience. Okay. That's what I talk about here in the book. And so on page 1661 traffic secrets, I kind of walked through a process. But the basic, the goal is like when you're getting, when you're, when you're driving traffic eventually, right? I can go and give Mark Zuckerberg money and he'll drive traffic to me. But if I can find someone who's on Mark Zuckerberg's platform who already has an audience, right? Like I find a Tony Robbins, right? Find a, who, insert whoever influencers inside of your space and they have a following of 10,000 or 100,000 million people. If I can build a relationship with that person, they can send an email or they can post on their wall. They can do something and they can promote me as an affiliate. And that way I don't have to actually spend money on the ads, right? And so for me, like when we launch click funnels, again, if you read the traffic secrets book, I go deep into this constant called the dream 100. Who are the hundred people that already have congregated your dream customers? It's like, how do we infiltrate? How do we start talking to these people? Right? And so the very first thing for me is like, if I know that I'm in the real estate market or I'm in the health market, whatever, the very first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go and I tell people, my go, go to Instagram and delete all of your contacts and then only follow every single influencer inside of your space. Right? Go and maybe it's setting up a new Instagram account, whatever you want to do, but create something and then go follow every single influencer. Right? Because I want to see like, who are all the people in my space who are already congregated my dream customers? Like those are the people. If I can get a relationship with one of those people, it can open up a huge door for me. Right? And send me the Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, podcast, like whatever it is, but you start gathering these people. Right? And you start trying to build relationships today. You're digging your well before you're thirsty. Okay? So what I would do is I'd go unsubscribe from people from everybody and then just follow the influencers who are in my space. And then it's like, I need to start building relationships with these people. How do we do that? Right? We do it by being part of their ecosystem. Right? When they're posting something, I'm liking, I'm hearty, I'm coming. I'm like, I want them to see my face every single time. I want them consistently like, man, whoever this Russell guy is, like he keeps commenting on my stuff. Right? And then I'm there. I'm like engaged in their, in their content, right? To start building relationships with them. I'm messaging them, DMing them, like, oh man, your podcast up. So last week was amazing. Thanks for sharing. My favorite thing was blah, blah, blah. Right? And I'm just trying to like, I'm trying to plant these seeds. I'm trying to dig this, dig a well before I'm thirsty. Right? And building a relationship first. And so that's how you start doing it to start building future relationships. And these are so important because one relationship in the future can change your entire business forever. I got a million examples of this, but one, I was thinking of like, when I launched my very first book, dot com secrets, I did the same process. I went to all the podcast directories, Instagram, wait, I went through everywhere. I built, I found a, you know, my, my 100 top podcasters, 100 top Instagram influencers, 100 top YouTubers. So I had a dream 100 on every single platform. And then I did is I sent a free copy of a book to the 100 top podcasts, 100 top YouTube, 100 Instagram. So I sent 500, 600 copies of my book out to everybody and it's like, here's my new book. Love for you to review it. See if you want to see if you want to post it, whatever. So I sent those out. And what's crazy about that is, um, I remember the very first person responded back was a guy named JLD. So we guys know John Lee Dumas. He runs entrepreneur on fire podcast. He messaged me, he's like, dude, this book's awesome. I'm like, thanks man. And he's like, I'd love to promote you, promote it. Do you want to come on the podcast? I'm like, I would love to come on the podcast. So he had him in the podcast and then he sent like a whole bunch of emails, his email list. And from that one person, that one connection, I think he sold like 500 or 600 copies of my book by himself. That was one person, right? And then Jeff Walker got a copy. He's like, this book's awesome. Like, thanks man. He's like, can I promote it? He sold like 2,500 copies of the book. And then Todd Brown got it. He sent a bunch of it. Another podcast over here. And then the YouTuber and influencer like from those relationships that I built, we sold hundreds of thousands of copies of my book. Right. But it started with me like building those relationships ahead of time. Like I was listening to podcasts. I was sending out messages. I was getting to know people so that when my, my offer and then promoting something showed up, um, they knew who I was. And it was easier for them to say yes. Right. So digging your well before you're thirsty, going out there, finding out who are the people who have your dream customer. Who are the other influencers in your market, getting to know those people, connecting with them. There's a live event that those people are gathering at. You need to be at that live event. You need to be hanging out in the room. Okay. I think I told this story before, but like, um, for me, I'll let you guys know again, I'm, I'm Mormon. I don't drink alcohol. I'm at this live event and all the people are hanging out and met the event. And then after hours, they're all going out to the bars and I don't drink and I don't want people to think I drink. But they're like, yeah, Russell, come in the bars, come to the bars. I'm like, ah, but I'm like, those are the people I got a network with. They're all in the same room together. So I think I told the story. I went down there and I ordered a milk from the bar from the barkeeper or whatever. I was like, he's like, you want milk? I'm like, yeah. Um, cause I didn't want it to look like alcohol or anything. So I had a cup of milk cause I'm walking around, which out, by the way, it was a great conversation. I'll be like, are you drinking milk? I'm like, oh yeah, I'm Mormon. I don't drink, I don't drink alcohol. I'm like, that's cool. Tell me about it. And then boom connection is, you know, networking, right? But I got to be around those people. So if I'm in the real estate market, I'm going to every real estate event. If I'm in the fitness market, I'm going to fitness events, my biohacking, biohacking events, like, and it can be virtual events, live events, in person. Like I got to get around the other people in my space and get to know and build relationships. Right? This game is a relationship game. Okay. Um, if Zuckerberg shut down Facebook, if Google, Instagram, everything disappeared tomorrow, I would be fine because of the relationships I built over time. Right? These people have email lists. They've got podcasts. They've got things. And so if everything fell apart, I'd still be okay. Right? And most people's businesses, I know if one little thing fell apart, if, if Instagram disappeared, their business is gone. Okay. So for me, if I lost every paid media platform on the planet, I'd still be fine. It wouldn't change our business. Right? Maybe a little bit, but not that much. Okay. In fact, if you've read Traffic Secrets, um, if you read, um, uh, where's that? Where's that? The introduction, literally, or the preface, the preface, every say it says, um, no, sorry, not the preface, preface. How do you say that? I should, I should definitely know that. Um, sorry, section number one. I started, I started section number one, um, or the introduction, there it is. Introduction, there's a storm coming. Dot, dot, dot. Right? And I wrote this book, yeah, four years ago, it came out and then right after that, all of the, all of the, um, uh, the Google slaps Facebook's out, everything started happening afterwards. I was like, I told you guys, this book is helping you to, um, to, uh, foolproof your marketing so that if the platform, not if, when the platform shuts you down, you don't lose your business. So there's a storm coming in. Those who took heed to this have succeeded. Those who haven't, like, again, go back and geek out. Okay. Sorry. I digress. So number one, again, is digging your well before you're thirsty. Number two is working your way in, right? Building relationships, contacting people, getting to know people. Like this is like such a key foundational part. Okay. If you were launching a product in an industry, people in the industry know who you are. Okay. You need to be connecting with those people in any way you can do it. Okay. Now I want to talk about one of the easiest ways to connect with those people. Okay. A lot of times I'm like, what do I say to them? And I was like, Hey Russell, you know, and so one of the easiest ways to connect with them is to give them something of value. Right. And one of the ways that you can connect with them is to give them something that is to give them something that that they need. Right. So if they get what the influencers in your market and your space, what are they looking for? Right. Influencers, people with followings, they're looking for a platform. And I talk about, I share a book, a story in here about, you guys remember our senior hall, like, right? Our senior hall. So, he was the biggest talk show back in the nineties. I remember he's the one that basically I think that he was the reason why Bill Clinton got elected as as president because he was like kind of struggling. And then he went on the show and played saxophone and like all these people loved him and ended up going in voting for him. Similar to like, anyway, Trump and Rogan, which is kind of interesting. Anyway, that's the story from the day. But so he's the biggest talk show in the world and it was a huge thing for four or five years. Eventually it kind of dried up and died. Right. And he lost the show. Anyway, fast forward. Now, 20 years later, he's on the apprentice. I'm watching celebrity apprentice and all of a sudden he comes out on the guest is our senior hall. And I'm like, that's our senior hall. I remember that guy. He was amazing. And they're doing all these different different tasks and stuff like that. And what's crazy is they get to they get to the task. It's like a fundraising task. I would like to call a friend's raise money for this thing. Right. So all the people out there, they're calling and raising money, everything. And our senior has got his role next to what's calling the first person next person next person. And they show him all day and nobody's returning calls. Nobody's like when all of a sudden he raises, I think he raised $0 from the whole fundraising campaign. And it was a pretty embarrassing because every other celebrity got deals done, got things in our senior. Got none of them. And I remember like the night, I think it was that night or something. He's sitting there and the camera captured this moment. That was like, oh, one of the most powerful things in the world. I think I was the only one that caught it because I was freaking out. And anyway, I talk about in traffic secrets, but he says this thing. He's looking at camera and he's talking. He's like, man, he's like, when I had a talk show, everybody returned my call. And I was like, oh, did you catch that when he has own platform, the president of the United States, the, like anybody, everyone returns call because they want access to his platform. Like what's the most valuable thing for the influencer? More influence, more, they need a platform. Like that's it. That's what they're looking for. Right. So for you, it's like, you need to have a platform before you have a funnel before you even offer you have a platform. Right. For a lot of reasons. Number one, and we'll talk about here is going to help you start publishing, getting your voice out there. Number two, it is the thing that you have to offer to the other influencers. Right. Hey, I mean, like when you're contacting me, I love your content. Love the last podcast episode. Would you be willing to come on a podcast? Would you be willing to come on my YouTube channel? Would you be willing to come on my Instagram? Like whatever, whatever your platform you decided is, like that's the thing of value. You have to offer these people. That's how you build connection. Right. Then you bring them off of social, you connect with them. You bring them on something where you're giving them access to your platform. You have a chance to talk to them, that you build a relationship. You talked them for 30 minutes or an hour during a podcast interview. Now they know who you know them and you've got connection. Right. And then you create content in the marketplace. Right. Like it's, it's so simple and so powerful and most people are not doing it. Right. That was something I'm launching my funnel, but I'll launch a podcast in the future. Like no wrong order. Flip it around. Right. I got to start building my influence today. And I do that by leveraging other people's influence. I give you that by giving them access to my platform. Assuming I was like, we're starting to have a platform yet. Well, you got to start them. That's exactly why you start today. Not next week of the year or like after your phone. Like you start digging your well before you're thirsty. Start today. Right. And then you might be saying, well, why would somebody come on a platform? I don't want to be followers. You're a listener. So it's like, yes, good point. That's why you got to start like start publishing. Right. Start your own podcast. You're a new to, I don't care what's channel anything. Pick a channel and start on it. You start getting people. Start gathering the many. Cause the only thing you have to offer another influencer right now is access to your many. So start gathering them. And even if it's small at first, that's okay. Right. When you start leveraging it grows to bigger and grows bigger and grows bigger over time. Okay. So thinking about that. Okay. Cause until you have your own platform, you're of no value to the people that you are trying to, to, um, to borrow influence from. Does that make sense? Okay. All right. Now this comes down to the last thing I want to talk about really. Um, and this is the key to it all is for you guys to start publishing. Um, uh, I talk about here in traffic secrets. I've been saying this now for five or six years. I've seen, I've seen tons of people on Instagram now quoting me. They don't give me credit for it, but there you go. But I said, this is the funnel. I think it was the second or third, you know, it was the second fun. I can live in San Diego. So really eight years ago, I remember Steve Larson was in the room and Steve told me that when he was coming to fun, I can live. He's like, I'm going to do everything Russell says, but I'm not going to publish something. I don't want to put my voice out there, but I'll do everything else he says. I got on stage and I said, um, I talked about publishing. I said, if you guys will publish every single day for a year, within a year from now, you're not about to worry about money again. And he was like, but I don't want to publish things. And then he like, fine. And so he did it, right? And it changes his whole business. It changes his whole life. Right. You got to start publishing. Um, and that's, that's the key. I think most people are missing now. Um, there's a lot of reasons why you got to start publishing. I'll talk about where and how here in a minute, but there's a, um, this is one of those. I'm one of my friends, Nathan Barry, Nathan owns convert kits. Technically we're competitors, but he's amazing. Liz and Boise, two boys, two tech companies, Boise is the tech capital of the world. Take that Silicon Valley. We're here in Boise anyway. So, uh, convert kit and click buttons are both here, uh, both in Boise, Idaho. And Nathan Barry is the CEO of convert kit and he's awesome. And he, um, and if you don't know Nathan, like a couple of years ago, somebody gave him a challenge and basically told him to do a blog post a day every single day for a year. And, and you'll never worry about money again. Very similar to my challenge, but it's for blogging, right? So he went out there and started blogging every single day for a year. And he tells his whole journey and how by the time the year was done, it changed everything. Like because it became a better writer, but also like people start finding his stuff, start growing and then all the companies like on the backside of that group. Um, then he wrote this post and this post, oh, it's so good. Okay. This is like, if you could tattoo a post to your face so you can look at every single day, this would be the one. So, uh, the post is the title says endure long enough to get noticed. Okay. It says how many great TV shows have you discovered in season three or later? I started watching Game of Thrones after they had released five seasons. Pat Flynn had released at least a hundred episodes of this podcast before I even know it existed. I discovered hardcore history years after Dan Carlin started producing it. This is such a common experience. There's so much content being produced. We can't possibly discover it all. So instead we wait for the best content to float to the surface after time. If step one in building an, um, step one in building an audience is to create great content. Step two is to endure long enough to get noticed. Seth Godin is very generous at this time. It will appear in almost any relevant podcast, but you have to have recorded at least a hundred episodes first. His filter is creators who have shown their willing to show up consistently for a long time. Okay. You guys getting this? So the reason why I start publishing is because you have to start getting your voice out there. And there's two reasons. Number one, it's going to help you to actually find your voice. Number two, it gives your audience long enough time to actually find you. Okay. That's why you're going to start today. You're like, bro, I can't start. I don't want to following. I suck at this. I don't know what I'm going to say exactly. It's why you have to start. You want the best, um, stories of this for me is actually me. Okay. Let me tell you a story about my life. Um, so, um, I built up a business. We had a big call center, we had a big company and then one day, literally overnight, holding claps at a fire, a hundred employees in one day who shrunk from a 20,000 square foot building to 2000 square foot building and everything. My whole life is falling apart. I'm like, this isn't going to work. Right. One of the many cycles of my, of my business career. Um, so hopefully all of you guys had a chance to go through some cycles in your life. Um, but going through the cycles, right? And, um, uh, and so I'm in this little tiny office, like we're bleeding money and trying to keep the doors open and trying to have to fire anyone else. Cause like, which fulfill on stuff we'd sold in the past. It was just chaos. Right. And I had a four minute commute from my house to the new office was four minute drive every day. And that about this time is when podcasting and we're talking about podcasting. It's going to be the future. And I was like, there's no way this podcasting thing is going to be the future. It's a stupid word. No one's going to think it's cool. And, uh, but I was like, you know what, I'm going to do podcasts anyway, just to prove you all wrong. And so I decided to launch a podcast. It was called, uh, the marketing in your car podcast. And so what I do is I grab my phone every day at a four minute commute, I click record on my phone. I would drive like this. I would drive to my form and office. I would talk about what I was doing today. Hey, today we're going to the office. Uh, we have an idea for the thing. We're going to try to bubble up, right? If I drive him back, Hey, last night I studied this guy and he told me about this. I'm going to try it and sorry. I just documented what I was doing every single day. Right. Four minute drive. I was publishing four or five, six podcasts episodes a week. Um, and what's crazy about back in the day, like podcasting was different. And so we had to upload through the word press side. It was this whole thing. And we didn't know how to track stats or listens or anyone's even listening. We had no idea, right? Uh, we were just putting out there and for me, it was more therapeutic for me to just like think out loud of what I was talking about. Right. Um, one of the smarter things that Gary Vaynerchuk said, he's like, it's not about creating contents about documenting your journey. That's exactly who it was. I was just documenting the journey. In fact, if you go back to the old marketing secrets pod, uh, sorry, marketing your car podcast, I talk about like, we had this idea for this thing. We bought a domain called click funnel. Me and Todd are bill. Like it gets all the stuff prior to that. And then like us discovering it, buying their main and launching it. Like, like the whole history of click funnels in there. It's really fun to go back and listen, but it's just me discovering these things as we're going and I'm sharing them in real time. I'm not actually like I'm an expert. I'm just like, these are the things that are happening. Right. So I'm putting these out there. Then to the backside of the launch click funnels. Uh, then she launched my inner circle. I find out craziest thing that 100% of people in my inner circle were podcast listeners. My best people were people who were listening to my long form content. I had no idea. It was funny. I had no idea. Right. There's like all the world of saw me on social everywhere, but the people who bought my high end coaching programs were 100% all podcast listeners. Those is direct correlation was crazy. Right. So we had the podcast listeners. Um, and then we launched click funnels and, uh, and then, um, and then again, this is four or five years into, uh, me launch this podcast. And finally we figured out how to reconnect it all so we can see how many downloads are coming at the time. We have some pretty good downloads coming in. We started looking back at like the graphs and trends and look like basically for the first year, almost nobody was listening. Okay. Now, number one, if I, if I had known how few people were listening when I first started, I probably would have stopped. I'm grateful that I didn't know. Okay. Um, number two funny thing is, uh, Steve Larson started working for me and you know, I love Steve. He was like, I'm going to binge listen to everything you've ever done. So we went through and listen to every single podcast episode. And I remember like, I think he spent a whole weekend binge listening or something. He comes back on Monday and he's like, man, he's like, listen to everything. He's like, you know what's crazy? He's like the first like 40, 45 episodes, like they were not good. In fact, they were pretty bad. He's like, you ever awkward? It was like painful. He's like, but I'm 40, 45 issues. Like, you got in your rhythm and you like, he's like, it was just different. Like you found your voice and so fun. And then now it's like amazing. And I thought that was so interesting. Right. Number one, like what are we doing? Why are we publishing? Number one is cause it's going to help you to find your voice. If you're hiding in a corner, building your funnel and building your offer, not talking, you're not going to ever find your voice. Right. So number one, number two, is it gets you long and you're out there long enough. Was Nathan Berry say for your audience to find you. Boom. And they think we're also right now, no one's following me. So it's going to suck. Exactly. That's the best time you want to suck when it's following you. Okay. Um, that's the whole point of it. Right. You'll get better and get better over time. It'll start ramping up. Right. And so that's the key as it's starting right now. You got to start publishing. And there's a lot of ways you can do it. Okay. Um, for a long time was blogging. Nathan Berry started his process blogging. I'm not a blogger. It's funny. I love writing books. I hate writing blog posts. So blogging is not for me. But maybe if you have blogging, okay. If so cool, like just focus on it. Okay. For Nathan was a thousand words a day for a year. That's what he was doing. Blogging a thousand words a day for a year and within a year, transform his business. Okay. Maybe you like audio. Okay. Cool. If you're an audio person, podcast. It's easy. Like literally I recorded the first 600, 500, 600 episodes on my phone. And people always mess with me. Like what's the, what's the microphone you're using? I was like, it's the one that's like cooked to the bottom of the phone. I just clicked the button and I have talk. Like that was it. Uh, you know, and then, um, uh, so there's that. Some of you guys may like video more. So do video. They like Instagram. Like figure out a platform you love the most organically anyway, they're spent time in anyway and do that. Right. I do think you understand the most. Like it's funny cause like, um, I, we dominate podcasts, we're great at Instagram. We're great in places. We're still struggling with YouTube. We're still figuring it out. Right. YouTube is a different platform for me. So I'm not YouTube. First, I'm podcast versus I get podcasts. My podcast listeners are my, my faithful. They love it. They're all subscribed. In fact, watching on YouTube, come to the podcast and listen on as well. Right. They're subscribed to listening while they're working out. They're hanging out. Right. YouTube is a different beast. We're still figuring things out. But I'm podcast first. YouTube is kind of secondary because, um, that's the platform I understand. Right. So figure what you understand. That's where you start publishing and start publishing consistently. Okay. And again, the goal is not for you to be amazing. The goal is not to get tons of views. The goal for you to start and start learning how to find your voice and doing it consistently. Right. Three days a week, five days a week, seven days a week, whatever it's, the more consistently, the better, because that's how you're going to find your voice. Right. And then after times, you, if you are consistent with it and you do not stop over time, your audience will find you. Okay. Now you've got a platform. Okay. And now you can go to people and be like, Hey, can I, you want to build my podcast or I'm in my YouTube channel? And even if you're following us on big first, that's okay. You don't go and like ask Tony Robbins day number one to be on your podcast. Right. You know, that's Russell Brunson, your podcast. And number one, you start looking at who are people that are about the same level as me or maybe a little bit bigger. And that's where you start. Okay. When I got started in this game, I remember the same thing. I remember, in fact, my, before I knew what a dream 100 was. I just knew I saw all the influencers back in the day. I saw Joe Vitale was one of them. And I saw Tony Robbins. I had all these Mark Joyner, how do these people's names? And remember, I was sending them emails and sending things in the mail. Like none of them responded back. I'm like, Oh, like this isn't fair. The only care about the little guys like me, like, why won't they help me? I remember having that like attitude. And then I remember going to an event and I met this guy. Actually, it was an event. It was online event first initially. His name is Mike Filson. So he has no Mike met Mike at this event. And Mike was like, I would say he was probably six months ahead of me in the game. He already had a product. He had launched a bunch of sales and I had my product called zip brand, or I had. I tried to sell it and I met Mike and Mike was getting, he was like, he was one step ahead of me. Right. And again, this is before we were podcasting. This is before any of the publishing stuff, but the concept was the same. So he's a little bit above me. I got to know him. He's easy to hold up because he's not Tony Robbins with like 800 gatekeepers, not Russell Brunson with 800 gatekeepers. You got to get through, right? It was just like him and he was a, it was the six months ahead of me. He had figured things out already. I was trying to figure out. So it was easy to get through his filters and get ahold of him. We started talking, build a relationship. And he's like, dude, that product's cool. And then Mike promoted zip brander. Okay. Literally promoted it. And I remember because we sold a whole bunch of them and 217 people joined my email list from the promotion of Mike Filson did. It's not funny to remember that number two, the number 270 people came to my site, saw the pop up, put the email address in, and drew my newsletter. And all of a sudden I had 217 people on my list, which I never had before. Okay. And then I went and then, and then Mike and I were talking and I was like, I think Mike, that was awesome. I'm like, Mike, who are the people you met so far? Mike said, Oh, you got to meet these other guys. This guy's named Gary Ambrose. And so like Mike had five or six other people he knew at our same level. He knew all these people and also now I had five people. And I was like, Hey, Gary, can I, I've got a list. Can I promote your product? A list of 217 people. He's like, sure. So I've noticed product coming to a three cells and he promotes mine. He makes two or three cells. And also like his list grows, my list grows, mice list grows. And then here's this person, this person, we start doing these things. All of a sudden, like, like our little friend group of people, we all start getting like, like our influence starts growing together a little bigger. Okay. What happens now? Now my list is three, four, 5,000 people. Right. Now I start looking right. Who are people have lists of three, four, 5,000 people? I start connecting like, Oh, there's this person, right? So I step one step up, gets those people. I've read value from their product, right? Whatever it is, I promote theirs, then they promote online. And I'm like, who are your friends? They introduced me. Also like, boom, and my business is growing and growing. Right. And that was the process. I did that for the year one, year two, year three, right? And eventually I was like, three years in the business, Joe Vitale messaged me. He's like, Hey, Russell, sign yourself online. It's really, really cool. Can I help you promote this product? I'm like, I messaged you three years ago. You did not respond to me. Right. Cause I had, I was down here, right. But because I looked at who the people around my same size, maybe a little bit bigger. I can take with them. Then we all grows together and they connected them, get frozen together. Like that was the game. Right. So eventually Joe Vitale came to me. Okay. Fast forward five more years later, I get a phone call from Tony Robbins. I didn't call him. They called me. Okay. That's why I got to meet Tony initially was not me aggressively outbound reaching. He reached out to me. Okay. Boom. And then next, and so like, that's how this game is played. Does that make sense? You guys. So this is how it works. You need to start digging your well before your thirst. Which means you start publishing today. Okay. You start publishing, start publishing. Right. Number two, you guys start figuring out who are the other influence. Your spaces are building relationships immediately. Doesn't mean going for the huge people at top. Right. Who is about your level? Like if you got a thousand followers on Instagram, who's got three to five? Go find those influencers. Those are the first people comment because they, those people, if you comment on the comments, they're going to see your name. They're like, Oh, this person comments every single time. Right. DM them, get on the phone with them, hang out. How can we show it? What if I did an Instagram live, uh, peruing your squeeze page? You promote mine. We both build our list together. Boom. Right. Promotions, partnerships, little things like that. Right. Your list grows, your list grows. Who are your friends? They get to connect you to five of their other friends. You connect them to five of your friends. Also, your whole network starts growing together and grows together. Boom. Boom. Boom. Right. That's how you build this game. That's how you win. Okay. This is what everyone's missing. Everyone's sitting there focusing just on building, offering, building, funneling for getting the fundamentals of you guys start gathering the many. And this is how the game is played. Okay. And if you do that, that's how you win long-term. Again, I've been in this business now 20, 22, 23, 24. I don't even remember at this point, right? In the time, I wish I could show you guys, um, the pedigree chart of the gurus who have come and gone and come and gone and come and gone and come and gone over the last two and a half decades. Okay. Tons of them. Who has lasted the test of time? I can count them on one hand. Literally. And I wouldn't need all the fingers even. Okay. Russell, how have you had longevity? How have you stayed throughout the thing? Because I still stop focusing on the most important thing. Okay. Gathering the many, gathering the many. Okay. Because you can gather the many, you're going to lose them. You're going to gather the many, you're going to lose them. You're going to gather the many, you're going to lose them. Like that's the game. Right. What happens? People gather their people, right? And then they start selling themselves and they forget to gather. And then the whole thing collapses. Gathering the many, gathering the many, gathering the many. Russell, why'd you spend a million dollars last month? $950,000 to gather people for an event? Because that's how you win the game. It's gathering the many. Right. If you want to make offers to people, great, but you got to have people that make offers too. Right. Okay. Russell, why are you still in the podcast? Why are you still doing this every single day? You're at like a thousand episodes. Why do you keep doing this? Right. In fact, I remember I was in an inner circle meeting and me and Garrett White were sitting next to each other and there was a guy in our room and we were trying to convince him to start publishing or talking. Right. And it was so fascinating to get looking at Russell. Because the guy, I can't remember the exact story. The guy had done some publishing. We kind of stopped whatever and he's like, I'm good. And he looks at me and just like, Russell, like, why do you keep publishing your podcast every single day? I said, I'm trying to find my voice. He's like, you've been doing this for a decade. Like, yeah. Right. Why did I relaunch the Russell Brunson show? Okay. I think we're four or five episodes in now. I did because I felt like I lost my voice. I was trying to do things based on scripting, based on keywords, based on stuff like that. And like, it was good, but it wasn't great. So like, I got to find my voice. Let me get back to Russell talking to a camera and hanging out and sharing the stories I want to share. Right. Like, let me tell you guys a story about me beating up a kid who messes with me and rests in football. Right. He came to the wrestling and I mopped him. Like, I want to tell you that story. What's the point of it? The point of it? I want to tell you that story. It makes me feel good about it. Right. It feels good about myself. Like, I want to tell you guys stories. And so for me, it's like, I'm still in the spot where I'm still trying to find my voice. Right. It doesn't end. Right. Your voice is getting better and better and better. In fact, it's crazy. My brother sent me this video of me. I could splice and, um, should I do it? Oh, okay. I'm gonna splice and I'm gonna have to splice in like a 10 second clip on the video and everything. It's me in a tie behind a desk and I'm awkwardly, so awkwardly talking. Shaved head, a tie and I look at that kid and that, again, I thought I was the stuff back then. I thought it was amazing. And I think about it now. I'm like, man, it's so embarrassing. I watch it now. It's like, oh, but I want to put an arm around like rustles keep going. Eventually you're going to figure out you can grow your hair out. You're going to find out that, um, that, you know, you can talk with energy, keep your eyes open. Like, you know, things like, cause like, anyway, so, okay, insert awkward clip of Russell right now. Welcome back. I hope you enjoyed the DVD and I hope you really spent some time thinking about your ideas and your product and how you could put all these pieces in and turn it into your business. Now, one thing that I want to also mention because a lot of people watch this DVD and they get so excited and they're fired up and we're back. I hope that wasn't too painful for you as it was for me, but, um, that's it. You guys, back then I thought I was good. That makes sense. I thought it was good back then. I look at me today like right now in my head, I think I'm pretty good. But in 10 years, someone look back at this and like, Russell, you were so bad. Right? Same thing for you, but you got to start and be consistent over and over and over again to figure that out and find it. He was fascinating to me. Um, when I met Tony Robbins originally, he was the same age I am right now. What? I remember thinking like, man, he's been doing this forever. Like he's this big, he's like, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like, no, he was my age when I met Tony. Like this is crazy to me. Um, and now I look at now. Okay. When I'm Tony's age, where can I be? Where should I be? Um, can I, can I, can I catch him? Can I laugh him? Am I going to lose to him? I don't know. Either way, it's going to be fun. It's going to be fun to compete. So, um, anyway, I hope you guys enjoyed this episode. I hope you use my ideas. The biggest thing is I just, I'm so tired. I feel so bad. People spend so much time and energy and effort building a product or a movement or a funnel or whatever that you want to call it. And then putting out there is no one to see it. It's like, and then usually what's been happening is they've been bootstrapping this thing for so long and it's like, oh, they can't like, there's no one to sell to. They can't afford ads. They can't do anything. Now they, they've got this thing, but they've got to go start gathering people and now they don't have time for it. They're out of money. They got to find another job. And it's like, ah, if you'd been doing these things simultaneously, you'd be fine at this point, but you missed the most important part, which is gathering the many initially. That is the key. So this is the focal point for you guys. Okay. Wherever you are right now in your business, it's like taking your time and, and breaking off. I'd say an hour a day. Okay. And the hour a day is for you to go out there and to network like crazy for you to publish like crazy and then get back to building your thing. Okay. Just block out first hour of your day. Okay. I'm going to spend 20 minutes networking. I'm going to go on Instagram, Facebook, whatever. I'm just DMing people, following people, getting to know people, trying to build a relationship, get them on calls with people. Then I'm coming out, record a 20 minute video, 20 minute podcast episode, upload it and then boom. Now I can go back to building my company, but if you're missing this piece, when you need the money, when you need like, you know, when you're thirsty, you have not been digging your well, you're going to miss it. Okay. And that is the key. So hope that helps you guys a lot. On top of that, if you have no traffic, I just recommend reading it because this is the keys to everything I know about getting traffic. It's a very strategic book, which means it's evergreen. It's timeless. It means it's not going to change. It means it works today, tomorrow, forever. I didn't, I specifically not put in tackle things that change with every, with every, you know, every wind of change inside the social media world. These are strategic things that will work forever. It's going to help you understand list building. It's going to help you understand focus on the right things. It's going to, yeah, it's the key, you guys. And so again, I love all my books. They're all great, but traffic secrets is a powerful one for you to understand so you can start building the traffic because until you gather the many, you don't have a business. Okay. And that's the key. So start getting the many, your people waiting for you. They're waiting for you stepping into your calling. They're waiting for you to show up and start publishing, start talking so they can find you. They're looking for what you have. They're in pain. They're trying to get out of pain and they're waiting for you to be willing to step into your calling and share your message. Okay. And you got to do it awkwardly. You got to do it. Uncomfortable. You got to do it in the spot where you're not ready yet, but until you are willing to do that, those people are cannot be like, you can't change your lives. So as soon as you're willing to step into your calling, they are there waiting for you so they can find you so you can change your life. So do it. I promise you'll be worth it. It's going to be scary first. You need nervous pain, all that kind of stuff. I get it. But the good news is when you first start publishing, when you are the worst, no one's going to be watching you. And by the time you figured out that's when your audience will show up. So start today. Have some fun. Appreciate y'all and see you guys all next episode.
