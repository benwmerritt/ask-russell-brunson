## Transcript
I spent $2,253.31 buying this cash register, partially for me, but mostly for you, because I wanted to share with you guys the story behind this company, this brand, because it's probably the greatest sales story that I've ever heard of. People always tell me all the time, like, I've also been to Fuddal Hacking Lab, I see the energy, I see people jumping around. But if you would have realized what this guy did, John Patterson, back in the early 1900s, he filled stadiums full of salespeople, motivating and trading and sending it out across the country to go sell these cash registers. So at the time you think about this, nobody had a cash register back then. So they went in and explained like, why you'd even need one, why you'd want one, and then selling these huge machines to companies all across the country. What he did from full season rules. That's why I started collecting everything that I could find from John H. Patterson, who was the pioneer, actually person behind National Cash Register. You guys see how it works? All you do is you get picked the letter, you spend money, $16, $64.69, turn the thing, boom. That's how cash register works. Put the money in. So this is one of the original National Cash Register from the early 1900s. The story about John Patterson is really fascinating. He was just a regular business owner, he owned a coal company, and he had this like suspicion that people were robbing. Like his employees robbing from him, he didn't really know. So he bought his very first cash register, within a very short period of time, he realized that people were actually still money from, from being in the cash register, stop that. And he was like, I love this as a concept. He's like, every business needs this. And think about it back in the day. Like this wasn't a known concept. People didn't know about cash registers. Like nowadays it's like every company in the world has one, right? Back then no one did. So he had to go and build an entire market from scratch. He had to build an industry and to convince people that they actually needed this thing, right? He was able to show his case, his testimonials, like here's how much money saved me. This is why you didn't want to end your business. First off, he figured out a craft that messaging, right? Which reminds me like when we launched ClickFunnels initially 10 years, like 10 years ago, nobody knew what a funnel was. It wasn't a concept in people's minds. It wasn't something where people were sitting down, how do I build a funnel today? Like we had to build an entire industry, which is why I feel like I relate so well to John Patterson. It's like he had this thing, it worked for him. He was trying to like convince the rest of the world they needed this thing. Same thing with me. Like I had used funnels for my potato gundi media. For the products I was creating back when I was in college, and that was coming out like, how do I convince the world that they need this thing that I know is very vital? It changed my life, but most people have no idea what the term even means. So I love that part of, but then the second phase, what John Patterson did was the coolest, because it wasn't just him going and selling door to door. Like he did that at first, like figure out sales pitch and how it all worked, but he was a great systems guy. Like he said, okay, if we're gonna do this, like we got to create a system and build sales teams. And so it's fascinating if he was the very first person ever in the history of the entire world to build sales teams and give them systematic training, like step by step processes and tools and like bringing people in and like the entire self strategy, he was the first person ever to do it, pioneered it. What's crazy is that at the peak, National Cash Renshaw or they call it NCR, they would do these huge events. They would fill huge stadiums full of people, people were sales people and they would motivate and they would trade just like funnel hacking live. And what was fun for me is I studied John and like just really understanding the story to figure out like one of the things I could be using for this story that implements that in our business, I would look at these, the stories of the stadiums and he would do awards for people. I was like, oh, what are the awards look like? So what an eBay, it actually found an award. But I saw it and I was like, oh my gosh, this guy's like literally cut from the same quality. It looked just like a two column couple of awards. I'm gonna show you guys this award. I was able to buy this for a few more or $500. This was one of the awards that you would give out to sales people, right? So it wasn't just like go sell some stuff. Like they did recognition, they brought people on stage and see the award here as it's presented to M-Sirak by the National Cash Register Company, Dave, Ohio, 125% of quota in June and July. So it's first thing they're quota, they got this thing up at the top, it's got the guy's name, it's John Patterson, his name, his logo, but this was like the original two column couple awards, right? There's a little cash register down here, but they were using these same things to train and to motivate sales people to get them to go out there then and start selling across the country. He was also the first person to go and say, okay, I have these sales teams of people, we're gonna go and we're gonna break up each of the cities into different locations and give people certain access to like just this area and this area, like making area exclusive program where people had different areas they could go and then send these people out. It was crazy, I was reading the stat, by the time John Patterson died, he worked all the way up to like his death, him and his company had sold over a million cash registers in that time, which is insane, free internet, free all those kind of things. A couple of the stats for me that are really fascinating. He was the first person to ever have formalized sales training. He was the first person to have standard sized sales scripts, territories and quotas. He also had full-time copywriters, writing sales letters, brochures and demos. They would send out to the areas before the sales people would show up. He was the first person ever to do a door-to-door like scorched earth approach. They would send everybody out and just see if they could knock every single door in the area and they just blanket the entire city by city all across the country. During the live events, they would have parades, bands, public recognition, like all sorts of crazy stuff. They had all these things he would drill in their heads, like one of their monitors. Everyone said, kind of like my monitor for all of our click funnels, phone hacking people, so I would say, you're one phone away, you're one phone away. Like one of their monitors was that the sales not complete until the machine isn't used. The sales person didn't just sell it. For the sale to be complete, they had to get people actually using it, consuming the product and plugging in and actually using it. One of the questions people asked is like, how do I apply this to my business? And there's two ways I see it. Number one is I know a lot of you guys have sales teams, right? If you have a sales team, have sales team down in the description and comment down below. Or number two is you have affiliates who are selling your products, which are also like a sales team, right? So either way, I look at these things like, these are the same ways you can motivate and train affiliates, right? The same way you can motivate and train your actual sales teams. And so a couple of things, in the first 10 years of ClickFunnels, we paid out over $200 million in commission. What we did is we immobilized sales team. We got them out there selling our products and our services. We had specific sales warrants just for our affiliates, right? We had the dream car contest where it's like, when somebody would sell 100 active people in the ClickFunnels, we'd pay for the lease on their dream car, right? So it's like, we had those incentives for our sales people. They got to come on stage and actually get an award with me. It wasn't just the people who went into Common Club Award, it was also for our affiliates, right? So for you, it's like, do you have an affiliate program? And so how are you motivating? How are you training? What kind of awards do you give them? Found a bunch of these different sales booklets, right? These booklets were all there to train the sales people on the scripts and the tools and the way to pull things. The question is like, if you have affiliates, like what tools are you giving them? Right before I record this video, I was actually in my office working on a new product called the Philly Boot Camp. And inside of Philly Boot Camp, what we're literally doing is for every one of my offers, we're giving them like, here's the offer you can promote. And that's where most people stop in their promotion, right? For us, it's like, here's the offer. And then on top of that, I said, okay, here's email, here's the place to buy ads. Here's the actual banner ads. Here's the videos you can use to go clip and post on the social media. We're giving them every single tool, every single script, every single thing. All the ads that we're running that are profitable. We're giving those ads to people so they can model us, so they can copy us. It's not just like putting it out like, hey, you should promote my product and hope for the best, right? It's actually training your people. Yesterday we had a guy named Tommy Mello here who was in the office. We did a really cool podcast interview with him and he built his company. It's A1 GarageStore. It's like literally garage store company. And he's built that company over $350 million a year in sales. The way he's done it is he focuses all his energy, all his attention on building on his sales. When someone joins his team and they want our cell phone, they have to move to his location. You buy a hotel next to his office or apartment complex next to his office. The guys actually move there for 30 days and they live with them. They do training with them. They ever see the day they're practicing, they're role playing, right? And so he sells, we spend 30 days with him learning these things before he sends them back out in their local area to actually start doing sales. So you look at something like Tommy, like he's using the exact same principles that John Patterson is using. If you had asked me ahead of time, like how much do you think the average garage store company makes? Like maybe, you know, 500, 600 grand a year. It's like $350 million a year he's doing. And his sole focus is on training the sales team. John Patterson's sole focus is on training the sales team. We launched ClickFords. Our sole focus was training the affiliates, training our internal sales team. And it's like, if you spend as much time and effort on trading your internal sales team or your external affiliates, as you do, you know, selling your products and your services, you will get so much growth and application because everything you're doing now, you're ready to sell script once, it's not just for you. It's for you, it's for your salespeople, it's for your affiliates, and it can grow and grow from there. If you're thinking more and more, okay, first off, I gotta learn how to sell, if I can trade a sales team, or I gotta learn how to sell so I can sell my affiliates. I wanna encourage you to come to my three days selling a line of it when we teach you the systems, the scripts, the processes to actually be able to sell. You can take those things and use them to train your sales team. In fact, with first launch ClickFunnels, I perfected sales, a one to many sales presentation. We built an entire sales team, we took that, went on the road. We sent people to events, we sent people doing webinars all across the country, all across the world doing events for me, duplicating myself by taking my one to many presentation and training the sales team, okay? We'll show you exactly how to do that. Or number two, if you're like, how do I train our affiliates? If you can give them a webinar or sales presentation they convert, again, the sky is the limit. So if you wanna learn how to sell the way that I sell, all you gotta do is click the link down in the description, go to sellingalline.com and register for our next event, which is coming up very, very soon. So I hope you guys enjoyed the story of John Patterson, National Cash Register, down in the dole, Zach Gal works, I'll charge you $30 and $9.17. And put it in the safe. Thanks so much you guys and see you guys up next.
