And so that said, let's queue up today's episode of the Marketing Seekers live show. What's up everybody? My name is Russell Brunson. Welcome to the Marketing Seekers live show. This is a fun experiment we've been doing. This is episode number two. We cover a whole bunch of things related to marketing and this episode we're talking a lot about the Traffic Seekers book launch, which is crazy. How many of you guys are excited about the Traffic Seekers book launch? I can't see the comments, but hopefully you're freaking out like I am. We're getting closer and closer. We spent the last year or more writing this book and working on it and we are almost to the end. So it's really exciting. But excited to have you guys here. We're gonna be going through a whole bunch of fun things and you guys have a chance to be behind the scenes a bunch of stuff as well. So hopefully have a fun hanging out today on this beautiful Friday and we should have a good time. So that said, I'm gonna jump right in to the first segment here in our show. So the first segment for the Marketing Seekers Live Show today is questions from the community and everybody's asking questions about this right here. The brand new Traffic Secrets book, which is coming out. The launch day is actually is like a week from Tuesday, which is crazy. It's March 17th, we're launching. So the question that we've been getting a ton from people is this, what's happening with the Traffic Seekers book launch? Can you give us any insider detail about it? So I would love to give you some insider detail. There's so many things that go into a book launch and or to any kind of product launch for that matter. And a lot of people ask questions about what are we doing and how are we doing it? So I'm gonna kind of tell you guys some of the stuff. So the first thing, step number one was it actually started almost two years ago. So this is some seeding for you guys. Understand that product launches don't start like a week before the product launch. Like two years ago, when I had the idea to start writing this book is when it all began. And so for the last two years, as I've been preparing it and like figuring out and testing the material and trying to learn the message of what's gonna be in this book. I spoke at multiple different events. I spoke at Dana Derek's event initially. It was very first was Dream 100 Con. And I spoke teaching some of the principles from Traffic Secrets. And I still memorized in the back of the mic doodling stuff out before I went up. And then I was like testing these different concepts and ideas to see which things stuck with people, which ones made sense, which confused people. And then a couple months later, we did a Traffic Secrets event for my two comic club ex students. And we taught it again for over two days. I taught the principles again and changed these and tweaked things. And then after that, I started talking about on my podcast and on Facebook lives and all sorts of places. And I tested it in little spots. I would speak different places. I would try different things and just kept testing the material. And then I started the actual writing process, which if those of you guys haven't written a book yet, I don't know, some people, some of my friends like Dana Derek's was like, I can write a book in an hour. Not me, it takes me like a year or more to write the book. And so I started the process of writing. And as I was writing, I didn't just write in hiding. I talked about it a lot on Instagram, on Facebook. I would share pictures, I would share me writing. I would share like chapter number three and like I would do this cool doodle and show the doodle off and try to build anticipation for the last year and excitement. And hopefully most of you guys have seen pieces of that and hopefully you're excited right now, right? Half of marketing is making enough noise to get people to actually care, right? So for last year, as I was doing this, I've been taking people on the journey. And that's been a big part of it because now people actually care. There's relevancy of like, why is this book? Why should I care about it? And now people are excited for it. Similar to like, if you guys have been, you know, followed the whole Marvel, MCU launch of, you know, their all series. Like it was years of like building up and sharing video after video. And this movie, this movie all leading up to eventually Avengers Endgame, which is when, you know, the whole thing kind of wrapped. But man, it was all the pressure and build up of a long time that got people to come. And that's why I became the highest gross movie all time. So, all right, so that's how it started then. As we got closer and closer and the book actually got done, then the next phase, which we started recently was like, I need to send this to some people to see if they like it. What's crazy is like for me as a writer, as I think anybody who creates anything, I heard Ryan Holiday say this in perennial seller, like when you create something, you're creating it in private, right? You're on your computer by yourself, you're with your thoughts and you're trying to like, create and you're so excited. And then when you first try to make it public, it's really, really scary. So, we printed 300 copies of the Traffic Secrets book and we did our Dream 100, which funny enough, I talk about in the Traffic Secrets book and figure it went on every platform, podcasting, Instagram, Facebook, Google, blogging, and just found different people in each of the markets that we thought would be good for our Dream 100 list, which are people who potentially could promote the book and we sent out copies about a week and a half, two weeks ago. And this for me was like the scariest thing, especially as people started getting it and started posting it on Facebook and Instagram, like I got Russell's book today. Every time I saw someone post that, I had the weird like excitement and then like the, oh my gosh, they're gonna read this thing and like super scary. In fact, yesterday, the master list builder, Joel Christopher, who's someone I learned from a decade and a half ago when I was first getting started, he got a copy of it and he read the whole section one last night and he was like highlighting and post pictures of his highlights. I remember like, I saw the message come through and I was like, had all the fear and anxiety of like, ah, what if he hates it? And I looked at it and it was like this page and it was all like highlighted all over in circle and I was like, oh my gosh, this is so exciting. I was at Tony Robbins' birthday last week ago and Garrett White was there and Garrett King gave me a hug. He said, he said, brother, as he does, brother, of all the three books, this is by far the best. I'm just like, ah, which is like the thing you're so scared about all the time. And then when people get it and you're like, ah, this is so cool. So that's when the second phase is Dream 100, getting it out there. And now next week we have the actual book launch, which is where the funnels will be live. And so my job on this phase of the book launch is to get a funnel that is going to actually convert. So when affiliates promote it and when we're buying ads to it, we're not losing money, that's actually profitable. And so we have been geeking out and working hard on this book funnel. And because I rewrote also the dot com secrets book and the expert secrets book, all three books have been rewritten now. We're doing new funnels for all three of them. It's kind of fun. So you'll see when the funnels go live next week, if you go to all three sites, they're similar style. In fact, when the style, well, you'll notice about the style and this is kind of maybe a little tip for everyone moving forward is that it's very much designed for mobile. Everything's one column instead of like, typically we always do pages side by side desktop. Man, so much more traffic's coming from mobile now than desktop that we're just shifting our design style to really cater to that. And so you'll notice this, the page design is different. It's cool. I've been geeking out on it and I'm really excited to roll out this entire funnel and the funnel and the upsells and downsells and all this stuff and it's exciting. So those are the details of the traffic secrets launch. The launch takes that starts March 17th and there's like a three week launch where I'll be promoting hard, a Phillips 3 promoting hard and we'll hopefully sell 100,000 plus copies of the book, which would be exciting. And that's kind of the first phase of the launch. And then at the end of that, then we're doing a live event here in Boise, Idaho, a small event like about 200 people or so. Hopefully you don't have to cancel it because of the coronavirus. Every event's being canceled right now, it's crazy. But we're doing a small event here in Boise where I have 40 of the top traffic speakers in the world coming and each doing a 30 minute presentation on a very tactical way to get traffic. Cause the traffic secrets book is very strategic and I want it very tactical. So we have 40 speakers each coming and they're all presenting a tactical thing on like how to get traffic from Pinterest, from Facebook, from LinkedIn, like just all different ways, different platforms and different ways to get traffic. And so that's going to be happening at the end of the initial book launch and then we're going to be streaming those live online. So hopefully you guys have a chance to watch a lot of those and each one of those will actually become like an ad. So it'll be when you watch it, it'll be me introducing the speaker, them speaking and then me doing call for action afterwards on the book. And each one will become a presentation, which will come an ad and you'll see that kind of behind the scenes as well happening at the end of the launch. And that happens first week in April and then afterwards then we move to the social launch. And this is where I basically have like a month and a half blocked out where I'm doing a bajillion podcast interviews, Facebook lives, other things. I don't even know what they're called and that's kind of what's happening. So that's kind of behind the scenes what's happening on the book launch. A lot of it is for the initial surge of sales and then the long-term social and then from there we'll just get back to normal marketing as usual. We're creating tons of ads, buying ads. I'm going to try to test this book on radio and other things. Dean Grasius said I've been talking about potentially an infomercial for it. I think it's such a universal topic. Everybody needs traffic and so I'm excited to get this message about the book out to more people. So that's what's happening with the Traffic Secrets book launch. I hope that helps and I hope it gives you ideas for different ways that you can launch your products, your services, your businesses, whatever it is that you are looking to launch out into the world. That's segment number one you guys. You guys ready for a giveaway? Should we do this giveaway? Okay. All right. We've got a huge present here. A huge box. I'm going to pull out here.

And then we'll go through and we're going to match the shares with the comments, put it in a thing, do a random drawing and boom, we'll pick someone and they will win the prize inside this box. Okay, so my first question for you guys, as you are sharing this, what do you guys think the prize inside the box is? And do you guys want to see what's inside? Like, should we open it? Like, should I reveal what's inside? And look at this box, by the way. I would do it just for this box. Like, look at this cool box. It's got the, it's really nicely designed. It's got the, it's got the, anyway, I can't show you because it'll tip over. The gift inside. So I'll give you some hints about this gift. Number one, it is a live. I can hear it inside. It's kind of purring and making some, just kidding, it's not a cat. I promise you it's not a cat. This is something that, there's only one on this planet right now. There's only one, okay? And so that's the first hint. Yeah, as of right now, there's only one. And somebody's going to win this thing and I'm excited for them. Thanks for just sharing. This is our share of Brandon's share. Kim's share and Alex's share and Melissa's share. Yeah, Kim, Alex, Melissa, you guys are, keep sharing. Okay. All right, should I show them what it is or should we keep more, should I tease them longer or should I show them what it is? Who wants to see what it is? Let's do it. All right, here we go. I need like a ladder to get in. Okay, I'm going to pull it down so I can, I'm not tall enough to do this, but. Like share, cardinal share, bill share. Keep on sharing guys. Keep sharing, keep it going. All right, inside the box is, oh, you excited? Here we go. It is the actual box set. What? Oh, this is the only one on this planet that exists right now is the box set of the three books. So, wait Russell, but you said there's three and there's four. Everyone gets confused like, I thought you said it's a trilogy, why is there four books? Like, don't take me literally in every, okay, so that's actually three books. So the first one is dot com secrets here. One thing about dot com secrets, if you've read the original, this is a rewrite. There's over 30,000 new words in here and a lot of new things that are amazing. That's basically the updated version for right now. So I've redone it, it's in hardbound copy. Then we got the expert secrets book, which is, again, I did a rewrite on this as well. I think there's like 25 to 30,000 new words in this as well, which is exciting, new frameworks, new, oh, I'm really, really proud of it. Number three is the traffic secrets book, which is coming soon to a funnel near you. And then number four is the unlock the secrets book. And the unlock secrets book is basically, it is a workbook that you use to go through the three books. Okay, and so this box set is something that we will be selling here in the near future, right now, one of you is gonna win this copy of the new thing, so it's exciting. All right, so check this out. So I even updated the subtitles because the books have changed. So this is dot com secrets, the underground playbook for growing your company online with sales funnels. That's book number one in the sequence. They're freaking out. Oh, by the way, if you don't share it now, you should probably like, now is the time to share if you wanna win this. Okay, that's number one. Book number two, boom, notice there's a new image on the front for those who are geeking out with me. And the new title, the underground playbook for converting your online visitors and the lifelong customers. Boom, there's book number two. In this series, book number three, traffic secrets. I've talked about this a lot, so it's the underground playbook for filling your websites and your funnels with your dream customers. Boom, and then book number four, the only way to get this is in the box. So there's no way to buy this one by a standalone. It's the unlock the secrets playbook. It says your underground playbook for scaling your company to the two comic club and beyond. And so this is a workbook that you will use in tandem with these right here. So it is a trilogy with a workbook. It's not a quadrilogy. Anyway, so if you guys want to win the box set, and the check out the back of it here, it's kind of cool. Boom, there's the back. So you got dot com secrets is the framework, expert secrets is the fire, traffic secrets is the fuel, and unlock secrets is your playbook. And then on the side it says you're just one funnel way. And this is a Garrett J. White quote. It says the life you want, the marriage you want, and the family you want are gonna be fueled by the businesses that you build. Boom, so there you go. Somebody at the end of this will win this. And the way to win it is to share this and then comment down below and say, I just shared it and that's how you can win this. So I'm gonna put this on the side. We'll come back to this throughout today's party, and somebody is gonna win this live at the end. But you gotta be live, so don't go to the bathroom, don't go to lunch. I just, this is way more important. Call Uber Eats if you need to eat and eat here and hang out with us the rest of the show. Okay, should we move on? Let's do it. Okay, hold on. I need a pulling dynamite down my water. All right, moving to the next segment of our show. Everybody welcome back. This is Mark and Seeker's Live, and today I'm gonna be interviewing one of my friends. Some of the works on a lot of projects with us here at ClickFunnels, and so this is called Tales of a Funnel Hacker. We're bringing one of our funnel hacking friends into this conversation. I'm gonna have a chance to interview him. I'll give you some heads up on who he is. So I actually met this person back, almost 10 years ago now. At the time we had a company called Overcomponography, and we help people overcomponography addiction. And this guy reached out to me, he's like, hey, I love what you're doing, I love your product. Can I help you sell more of these? I'm like, sure, how do you do that? He's like, I'm a YouTube guy. Let me post some videos on YouTube and we'll get you some traffic. So we posted two of these videos on YouTube promoting our overcoming pornography addiction product, and the two videos got millions of views. In fact, we don't sell the product anymore, and there's still traffic coming from these videos every single day. As we started going to ClickFunnels, I reached out to him and asked if he'd help with our YouTube strategy, and recently helped us get to over 100,000 subscribers on YouTube. He's an amazing guy. He's been in my inner circle for the last couple of years, and someone that I have a ton of respect for and excited to have with us today. So do I need to do anything to get Joe up here? His name is Joe Marfolio. Joe, how are you doing, man? What's happening, man? Hey, glad to be here. Thank you for that awesome intro. Okay, man, this is the first time we've done a live interview on the show before, which is really exciting. We're excited. And I love you got your funnel hacker shirt on, and then all your two Comic Club awards in the back. That's it, man. Just waiting for the two Comic Club X to come in the mail to even out the set. So that's gonna be awesome. Yep, Joe just won one last week. You guys have funneled a lot of life. He got one, which is pretty cool. So, all right, so obviously we don't have a ton of time, but I got a lot of questions for you. So inside of the Traffic Secrets book, there's a whole chapter on YouTube traffic. And most of it I pulled from you, because you are the guy who, on our team, is doing all of our YouTube, doing all the stuff, and you've done such an amazing job. And so most of the things are there from you. And so this is kind of to tease people a little bit about what's happening inside the book, but also just to get them to know you and understand what's more about YouTube. So why is YouTube, do you think, different than all the other platforms that are out there? You know, we've got Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, all this stuff, like why is YouTube, like why are you so passionate about YouTube? You know, so like, yeah, you have Facebook, Instagram, and I see a lot of people like it's very, it's sometimes easier for them to build a big following on Facebook or Instagram. They kind of go to YouTube and they struggle a little bit. And it's because YouTube isn't just a social media platform, it is a social media platform, but it's also a search engine where people are searching for certain topics, maybe they're searching how to do something. But, you know, so what you have to do with YouTube is not only put up content that's engaging that people want to watch that has value, but you also have to add kind of a story element to it. And the one thing that you don't want to do, and I see people do this, is kind of repurpose your content. Like say you have content you put on Facebook, and then Instagram or a podcast, and you like, you know, and then you distribute to all these different channels, if you put it on YouTube, a lot of times you're gonna find that it's not gonna get that much traction. And think about YouTube like this, like when you watch YouTube yourself, like if you guys are out there and you're watching YouTube, you know, why do you subscribe to a certain channel? You're gonna subscribe, right? Maybe they're showing you how to make money online or how to grow your Instagram, right? But there's a ton of videos on there that talk about like how to grow your Instagram channel. But it's like, what makes you subscribe and want to watch somebody? It's gonna be their personality, it's gonna be the way they engage with you, and it's gonna be the way the content comes across. So what I would say for YouTube, the difference is, is treat YouTube like it's own thing, make videos just for YouTube, and try to approach it not as a marketer, but as a creator. Not that you're gonna sell anything, but that you're going to like build your audience and your following. Yeah, one of my favorite things about YouTube too is, and I talk about this in the book a little bit, like every social platform, like say we do a Facebook live, like we're doing right now, it's happening and then like it'll drop, it'll be here for the next couple of days and it'll drop down the news feed and then eventually just disappears and nobody will ever see it again. Whereas YouTube is like the only platform where you create something and then it grows over time, because it's not just social, like I said it's social and it's search, and that's why it's so different, like it's different because you create something, if you create it the right way, then it sits there and it grows throughout time as opposed to everything else which seems to diminish over time. And so it gives, at least someone for me who's creating stuff, it gives me more incentive to create stuff that's nice because it lasts beyond the moment. Whereas Facebook Live, it's there for a moment and then it's gone, whereas YouTube, it can last for forever. We talked about earlier, the Overcome Pornography videos, Overcoming Pornography Addiction, like they still get hundreds and hundreds of views every single month, even though we don't even sell the product anymore, which is probably sad because you're an affiliate making money when it probably was there. No, like yeah, that video, I think I sent you a screenshot when you were doing the book, it has hundreds of clicks on there. And what it does is the content builds on each other. So like you put a video out three years ago and if you keep putting content out, it's like you're gonna keep getting leads, you're gonna keep getting people subscribing and watching your stuff. Like you said, yeah, it just doesn't disappear, it just builds on top of each other. Okay, I wanna ask another question. This is off the questions that you sent me as pre-question, because I'm excited about this one. I hope that's okay. I'm gonna put you on spot a little bit, but I think a lot of times people think YouTube strategy is like, okay, I gotta make the most perfect video in the world. And you look at companies like Dollar Shave Club, right? For example, where they made this video and it goes crazy viral and then builds a huge company up and then he sells to whoever he sold for, it's like a billion dollars, right? And so we're like, okay, I've gotta make the perfect YouTube video and like people stress about it and because of that, they never actually make something at all versus like you told me in the book, we shared the example, we talked about the strategy like Gillette or other things like that. We talk about that, cause I feel like that's a strategy that more people like me can actually do. I'm not like, I gotta make the perfect video instead. It's looking at it a little bit differently. We talk about how Gillette did their strategy and how we can use that as well. Yeah, so here's the thing, when you guys are starting your YouTube channel, think of it like in, the first thing you wanna do is really go deep in your niche, whatever you're doing. Like, so for example, Gillette, what they did was they didn't go out there and say, well, they did. They tried to make a viral video like Dollar Shave Club in a flop, right? So what they did was they said, listen, we wanna dominate for the keyword how to shave because the people that watch how to shave videos buy our product, right? So you did how to shave your head, how to shave your back, how to shave your legs, right? We did all these videos that got hundreds of thousands and millions of views and they were very targeted to their subscribers. So the thing I would tell people is figure out what your niche is, figure out what you're gonna go after and go deep in that niche, kinda like the way you explain the whole Blue Ocean strategy and expert secrets. Because, and the one thing you don't wanna do is go and look at someone who has a million subscribers and then follow what they do, right? So like say you're doing, because they've already been established, they already have a huge audience. So say you're doing Amazon. So what you wanna do is go through Amazon and say, okay, make videos on Amazon, on Amazon FBA, on Amazon drop shipping, on Amazon affiliate and then go through and hit every time, anything that someone's searching for Amazon, you wanna make a video on. And it doesn't have to be a perfect video. Like you said, it just has to be engaging enough to get retention, but it doesn't have to be this high production video. What you don't wanna do is you don't wanna make a video on Amazon, then make a video on how to make money online, then make a video on procrastination and then make a video on the coronavirus, right? You want, if you're just starting, like you want to create like this, this traffic lane that YouTube knows, okay, when Joe puts a video out, it's gonna be on Amazon. And then they'll start showing your video to more and more people that search, like say Amazon stuff, and then you could expand out from there. Very cool. Yeah, you should go look at Gillette. So it was fun after you told me that story, I went and looked in there and you see all the, like there was stuff that I never would have dreamt people are looking to shave. So it's, all right, there you go. There's a video for that now too, which is awesome. It's very cool. Okay, my next question for you is, when someone creates, like they said they're creating videos and they're posting on YouTube and they're not getting any traction, not getting a lot of views, like, what would be the best way for someone to look at that and like, okay, here's how I tweak it or optimize it to get people to actually start watching my videos? All right, that's a great question. Cause they see this all the time. Like they see people posting their videos up there and they're getting no views and they just keep posting the same videos. So here's the thing, think of it like this, think of your YouTube channel, like say you have a store, Brick and Mortar store, think of your YouTube channel as that's your storefront, right? The videos that you created, your product and the people that view it and subscribe are your customers, right? They're raising their hand, say I want that product. If you're putting videos out, you know, always watching them or subscribing or very little people are watching and subscribing, you would change up the way you're making your videos. There's something wrong with the way you're making your videos. Don't batch out your videos and just throw them out there. You have to see what videos are engaging. So what I would say is the first thing I would start out is like I said, find your set of keywords, right? Your content bucket, start putting those videos out. See which videos start getting some traction and then double down on those keywords. The other thing you want to do is constantly be testing your thumbnails. The two most important things about your video is gonna be your thumbnail and your attention. You get the best video in the world, but if your thumbnail stinks and your title doesn't have a hook, people aren't gonna click on it. So the thumbnail is, that's like the visual hook. That's gonna stop people from scrolling and say, what's happening here? You know, so big faces, little bit of text. Your title has your keyword in it, but it also has your hook. And then the video, the first 30 seconds to the minute is the most important part of your video because that's where you want to hook people and that's where you want to keep at least 80% retention and you want at least 50% retention all the way to the end. If you're not getting that, the best thing to do is after you shoot your video, putting call outs, putting some B-roll, kind of do some pattern interrupts to keep people visually engaged with your video because unlike, like say a podcast, when people are watching on YouTube, if you're not visually engaging them, they're gonna look somewhere else. There's like a hundred different options for them to click on around the video, like distraction. Right, like a good example of this is on your channel, you had a video up on sales funnels and you posted a few years ago, it got a couple of thousand views, we took that same video, just added call outs and B-roll, I think that new video has 150,000 views. And the simple thing is, is even though it's amazing information, it doesn't matter who it is, like if people aren't like visually stimulated, they're gonna go off. Yeah, interesting. A couple of things that I learned from you that were crazy is like the thumbnail one, like you said, we used to make these beautifully designed thumbnails and then the click through rate wasn't very high and then you made these, no offense, but like these ones are like, ah! And then it's like five times more click throughs, I'm like, oh crap! And it was interesting, a Funnel Hacking Live Prince Da talked about that, I said that when you do a shoot, most people like, they do the video and then they try to find a steal to make the thing, he's like, no, like you bring professional photographers, he's like, that's the most important part is the thumbnail. He says that they'll spend more time trying to get the right thumbnail image sometimes than the entire video as a whole. And so I think that's one big thing. The second thing that I learned from you that was interesting, we did 100 plus episodes of our Funnel Hacker TV show and I loved it, they were so much fun, but we never got tons of views, I'm like, why are people not loving this? And when you started looking at our stats, you're like, well the reason why is, people watch the first little bit and then you have like a 30 second cool intro that was like amazing, like it was the most amazing intro of all time, like any creator would be so proud of like this amazing intro and then I got into the content and you show me like, here they are hooked and then the intro starts and then whoo, and then like people at the end that make it through that stay on. And then you went from like, take a 30 second intro and make like a one and a half second intro. I was like, but it's so like on a TV show, they have a huge intro and it's amazing. And you're like, if they're not watching TV, they're sitting here with YouTube with a thousand things around them, like distracting them. You gotta be focused and like get to the point quick and engage them and keep them hooked. So things like that that I think creators like me are like, oh, look at my intro. It is so long. And it's like, that was not the right move. No, no, people, yeah, exactly. Like so the best kind of format is like a 15 second hook, four to five second like branded intro, 10, 15 seconds who you are, your content and they call the action at the end. So cool. Yeah. Oh man. Well, do I appreciate you coming on man. This is fun to do my first live interview. I'm not the best interviewer, but you're a great guest and share some super actionable and important things. And I think what I would recommend, you know, we're funnel hackers here. So we're good at like looking and modeling what people are doing. And so go look at our channel and look at the videos that get a lot of views and ones that don't give very many. And Joe's are always optimizing stuff and figuring things out. But half of this whole game is like looking at what was working and then like, why is that working? Right? That's what I'm doing. That's what you're doing. Like we're always doing that in our all aspects. Like why is that working? What was the reason? And then trying it, testing and making little tweaks and changes. I would love to share one last thing just because I remember the first time there was a plugin in Chrome, I think it was Chrome that you told me to download. And I downloaded this like, I don't know, three or four years ago. And now every time I go to YouTube, I see all the stats and it's like so much fun to see all that kind of stuff. And I think most people don't even know that there's stuff like tools that is available to give you all the analytics and all the detail on the video. I'll talk about any of the tools like that that you use right now that people can use as well. Yeah. So one of the ones is vidIQ is the one that I told you about, which is, is I love it because I do SEO. So like the data in there is amazing. And, you know, everyone should get it. They have like the best part about it. Like you can put your competitors in there. You can see what they're doing. You can see like what videos are trending for them. You know, so, so that's a great video. Another one I think is TubeBuddy, which is, you know, it's okay, but like if my preference is definitely vidIQ just because it has all that data, especially if you're constantly testing and looking at stuff. It's crazy to show you, show you like your competitors videos like this video got added X amount of people to their, subscribe their channel because it's video. And then this how many views they got, how many is getting per day and like all that. You're like, how are they telling me all this stuff? This is amazing. It shows you all the stuff that, and then you can reverse engineer from there. Like as a funnel hacker, that's what we're looking at. How do we reverse engineer things? And this gives you like, it's basically like, here's what's happening in the video. And then from there you can reverse engineer like, cool. Now I know what I need to do. What I need to create. Like how do I make something better? How do I, how do I make something that's gonna, it's gonna beat that one out. So I get all those views coming to mine instead and stuff like that. Yeah. Awesome. Well, thanks Joe. I appreciate you coming and being on the show. Everyone, if you had a good time with Joe, comment down below and say, thank you Joe. We love you. He's been such a huge, huge, you know, support for, for, for me for the last like almost 10, it's been almost 10 years hasn't it? Since we first met. Yeah, I think so 2012, I think. That's crazy. So long time and a huge help for us here inside ClickFunnels growing our YouTube channel and helping us get the message out to more people. So grateful for you, man. Thanks for being on the show. And everyone, please comment down below and tell Joe, thank you for, for spending time with us today. All right. Thanks guys. Thanks man. Thanks Russell. Looks like to you later. All right. Let's see you then. All right. How was that? You guys, that was fun. We should do more, more interviews like that. I think though I need a chair to sit in next time and do an interview because I was like, anyway, that's the story from the day. This is the behind the scenes portion of the show. Ken, let's see where we're going from here. All right. Okay. All right. Next in this show, we are going to be bringing up something called the JK5. What is the JK5? You guys probably don't know what that is yet, but after you read the Traffic Secrets book, which one of you guys is going to win today by sharing this video, you'll know more about the JK5, something I learned from Jenna Kutcher, where basically she talked about picking five different categories of things you're passionate about. That's what you start posting about. So throughout the show, I'm going to be sharing videos and pictures and clips from things that I'm passionate about. So my JK5, the categories of things I care about in life most are family, funnels, faith, entrepreneurship and personal development. And so I'm going to be sharing some of those things with you guys today. The first one right here is this picture. And I'm sharing this picture to deal with entrepreneurship. So some background on this. This is actually a shot of me and Prince EA at Funnel Hacking Live. And if any of you guys, for all of you who are at Funnel Hacking Live, you saw this and you saw like, how amazing Prince EA was. And he actually made a video with us and then he launched it at the event, which has gone on to get like tens of millions of views, which is crazy. But this is a really powerful moment for me because he's someone who I've always looked up to for a long time. My son actually downloads all of Prince EA's videos on Spotify and listens to him over and over and over again. And he didn't know, I don't think until this moment, how much of an impact he had not only on me, but also on my kids, which is more important to me than impact on myself. And I told him on stage, I said, look, not only have you had a huge impact on me in my life, you've also had a huge impact on my son who listens to you. And you're one of the most positive influences he hears every single day. He's at school getting beat up by, not physically beat up, but beat up by all the temptations and the trials and the problems with school and friends and bullies and all that kind of stuff. And then there's music that goes through this negative sometimes when there's TV, like all these things. And then he plugs in and listens to Prince EA and from that gets a dose of positivity and personal development in an amazing way. And Prince EA is someone who took his art and turned it into something that's affecting literally millions and millions of people's lives. His videos have been seen, I think, three billion times so far. And so this is one of my favorite pictures on stage with him. We had a chance to hang out, talk. I told him a story about my son, Dallin, and how much of an impact he had. And we both got all choked up and just had an amazing moment. So that is what this picture is about. And if you guys like this, when I do post it on my Instagram wall, please like it, comment, and tell Prince EA that he is the man and thank him for his contributions to me and to our community as a whole. All right, another one? All right, the next one I wanna share with you guys, this is from my good friend, Mr. Dean Graciosi. And what's that? I gotta flip the slide over. All right, so I got some words of wisdom from Dean Graciosi, Dean, someone who, when I was a teenager, I used to watch him. He did late night infomercials, first selling his Motor Millions program and later real estate programs. I remember I used to watch him and take notes tonight because I was so obsessed with how to sell and watching him do what he does. And he's become a dear friend and someone who I respect so much in this industry. And so this is a quote from Dean. It says, without good marketing, your ideas, actually I got it back here, without good marketing, your ideas will be just that good ideas. And so I think, you know, so many of us have good ideas, right? In fact, sometimes we have too many ideas. And I don't know, I believe that God gives us all ideas and he'll give it to me and then if I don't do something, he gives it to somebody else. If I don't do something, he keeps giving it to somebody until somebody takes it and runs with it, right? And applies marketing to it and actually turns it into something bigger. How many times have you had an idea and then later you're like, oh, I had the idea for Uber. Oh, I had the idea for that. We had these ideas, right? They come to us, but some reason we don't take them. And so understanding that like, and ideas, like there are dimes of dozen, right? Everyone's getting ideas where like, we're getting inspiration all the time. The people who take the ideas don't apply good marketing to them. They're the ones who are rewarded for that. Like you get the benefits of that, right? You have the chance to affect people's lives and change their lives. You make more money off of like, all the good things come when you take an idea and you apply a really, really good marketing to it. And so for all of you guys, I think that's why it's so important to become great at marketing. It's why the whole point of this show, the marketing secret show, the point of all the books that we do, like all the events, everything we're doing is teaching marketing. You can apply to any business, any idea, any product, any service and amplify your message. I feel like our goal here is to help all of you guys amplify your messages. And so understanding that, that without good marketing, your ideas are just that. Good ideas. Thank you, Dean Graciosi, for being amazing and for sharing the word of wisdom for today. All right. All right, we're coming back to the giveaway. So how many shares we have so far? We got a lot of people sharing this thing. A lot of shares. All right, that's good for those who've already shared.

Someone's gonna get it for free today just by sharing this video and commenting down below that you shared. All right, that sound good? Okay, we are back to, we're back to having some fun. Okay. All right, we are now moving to the next segment of the show which is called the Ask, Russell, Anything. And I need my phone for this, right? You do, yes. It is right behind you right there. Okay, so welcome to the Ask, Russell, Anything portion of the show, which I'm really excited for. And so what's happening in the segment of the show is we have people from our funnel hacking community who send questions to me through video and then I'm gonna respond and answer them live on the show. So if you ever have a question, you can comment down below our social team later on how to send it, but you can send questions. I'm gonna be answering some live on the show today. So the first question we have today is from Mr. Josh Forty. Josh, somebody who I've been watching for the last couple of years, been super impressed with him and excited to have his question. I've not actually pre-listed these questions yet. So I'm gonna find out live with you what his question actually is and I'm gonna respond back to it on my phone and we'll send it to him here in a minute. So with that said, let's queue up Josh's question. Here we go. What's up, Russell? It's Josh Forty and one of the things that you always talk about is knowing your who and knowing where they're at, where they're located and where they're hanging out. And so my question for you is, what are some ways that we can better understand our who and figure out where they're hanging out and where they're located so we can create content around that and target them and bring them in to our funnels? Thanks so much for your time, man. I really appreciate it. Josh Forty, that's a great question. All right, here we go. I'm gonna answer that right now live on my video. Okay, here we go. What's up, Josh? That is an amazing question. And so it's interesting when I first got started in this game, I remember I met a copywriter and he told me that he got hired by a woman to write a sales letter for a female product. And as a man, he was like, well, I don't really understand my dream customer. What am I gonna do? So he went and he said, well, where are my dream customers congregating at? And he found that there's obviously a whole bunch of women at the hair salon. So he called the owner of the hair salon, and he's like, do you mind if I come in and just like hang out for the day? I promise I'm not creepy. There's a reason why I'm doing this. And he talked the person into letting him in. So he walked in, he sat down the hair salon and he sat there with a notepad and like a magazine pretending like he was like just waiting for his wife or something and then listened. And he said he sat there for hours and hours, listening to them talk about what their frustrations were complaining, what they're excited about, like all sorts of things and he's taking notes like crazy. And he tried to get himself in the mindset of that dream customer, even though he wasn't a dream customer. And then he came back and wrote the sales letter, gave it back to this woman and she launched it and built a huge company based on the messaging. And so it was interesting watching that because that was someone who was trying to go after a dream customer they didn't understand. For most of our businesses, the dream customer we're serving is typically us like five years ago, right? Like everything I'm creating today was for Little Russell 10 years ago who was trying to figure out this internet game, right? Like I would have died to have a copy of any of these books right here because this is like the answers I was searching for. I spent a decade and a half of searching for those answers, right? I would have died to have click funds like a drag and drop things and movement around. So you have to understand that like your dream customer is you like 10 years ago. So you gotta get in the mindset of like 10 years ago or five years ago, like what were you doing? Where were you hanging out? Where were you searching for those answers? Right? Were you going to different forums? Were you on Facebook or Instagram? Were you going to live events? What books were you reading? It's getting in that mindset of like where you were back when you were your dream customer, right? And then getting back into those things and put yourself just like my friend went to the hair salon and sat there listening. It's the same thing. You gotta go back to where you used to search for information and then sit there and listen. I still listen to probably, I don't know, an average five or six podcasts a day. Why? Like am I trying to figure out the new biggest tip and trick to grow, to grow click funds? Yeah, I'm looking for that always. But for the most part, what I'm looking for right now is I'm listening to like, what are people saying to my dream customer? How are they saying it? What are they getting my dream customer excited by? So that I can, when I come out of the market, I'm making a video or writing a book or talking about something. I know the language that they're hearing. I understand what the frame that they're entering this conversation through and now I can adjust how I'm talking based on that, right? If I know that my dream customer's listening to podcasts, I'm gonna go listen to it. Even if I'm not trying to get something new, I'm trying to understand what they're hearing so I can tater my message to that, right? What blogs am I listening? What podcasts? Like what Facebook groups? What people are they following? What books are they reading? I'm immersing myself less right now in my journey to learn the next new thing and more so to understand what my dream customer's being exposed to so I can either navigate around that, I can shift the message, I can change it and that's really the biggest goal. So look back in time to where you were three or four years ago and figure out where you were at, what you were doing, what you were thinking, what you were reading, what you were listening to, get back in that state of mind and start paying attention and that'll help you to understand who your dream customer is and after you understand that, it's easy because you're already sitting there hanging out with their ad and now it's like, hey, I'm hearing this message, let me buy ads and buy ads on those podcasts and buying ads on those blogs, on those Facebook pages, whatever it might be because now you're congregating where they're at anyway and you'll know exactly how to navigate and bring them to where you are today. Hope that helps man and I appreciate all the good you are doing in the world, thanks man. That was fun, all right, there you go. It's question number one from Josh Forty, thank you Josh, I appreciate that. Hopefully all you guys at home got something from that as well, if you did, please comment down below and be like, that was awesome or if you're like, that was lame, I don't like that rustle, like I actually don't comment that. Yeah, if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all. All right, number two, question number two. Next is from Alex Lombard, Alex, I'm excited to hear your question again, I'm not pre-screened, pre-heard these questions so I'm excited to listen to it and then to respond back here in real time. So here we go, Alex. Russell, what's going on brother? Alex Lombard here from Vision Wall and I had a question for you around webinar show rate. My question is, what are some of the top things that you've seen in the last like six months to 12 months when it comes to getting people who register for a webinar to actually show up? What are you doing to increase the show rate on your actual live webinars? I would love to hear that. Thank you so much, talk soon. All right, great question from Alex. All right, here we go. What's up Alex, thank you for the question, totally appreciate it and it's interesting because I think everyone's looking for like, what's the new trick or the new hack or the new sneaky thing that gets more people to show up? And the reality is the reason why people show up to a webinar 100% is because of curiosity, that's it. It's crazy, like we last year, one of my inner circle members, they had a webinar and their registration rate was super low and their show up rate was super low. And all we did is we tweaked the headline to make it more curiosity driven and their cost per lead went down, their conversion rate went up and their show up rate doubled just by making more curiosity. So the question isn't like, what's the new magic trick? Like the software tool is gonna text them better to get them to come in. It's like, how do you create more raw curiosity and desire to get somebody to come on? I think sometimes we get lazy in our old age and think like, oh, well because I have a webinar, people are gonna show up saying, no, no, no, there's a lot of webinars to choose from. Think about TV when you're on Netflix, flipping through all different channels, like why do you watch one show versus the other? Something grabs you that like makes you curious and you're like, ah, man, there's literally eight billion hours of content here. I'm gonna watch that one, why? Something drew you in. And so that starts from the very, very beginning from your ad, your ad needs to increase, like take the curiosity I have right now and like dramatically increase it to get people like, I have to know what this is. I have to block this out of my calendar or I'm gonna miss it, right? Then the landing page, increase the curiosity, right? And then if you have a warm up sequence, you have some registers before they show up. We used to call these indoctrination sequences. Garrett White calls them a pre-seduction sequence, which makes it even like more curiosity, more like interesting, how are you seducing your person to make them wanna show up, right? And so I don't think that the next big breakthrough in getting people to show up to a webinar is a technological thing. I think it's coming back to the basics, coming back to curiosity, seduction, indoctrination, whatever you wanna call it, it gets people where it's like, because think about yourself, like how many times do you register for a webinar? Like, oh, cool, like if I, that sounds cool, maybe I'll show up, or maybe I'll catch the replay and you register and you forget about it, right? Versus the times when you register for one and you're like, I have to be there and you go to your calendar and you block it in your calendar and you anxiously wait for that. What's the difference? The difference has nothing to do with the actual content on the webinar. Has everything, the text message that comes through 15 minutes before, all the different things, has to do with like, I have to know what he's talking about, because I do not, I can't guess it from the headline, I can't figure it out, it seems different. Like, I need this, I need to figure out what that thing is. And so, whatever you can do to take the curiosity and just ramp it up 100 times, that's gonna do more for you than any other magical, you know, technical thing. It all comes down to curiosity. So, hope that helps, man. Appreciate you, thanks for sending your question and good luck with your next webinar. Boom, there we go. The webinar traffic seekers. You guys like that one? Do you got something good out of it? Please comment down below. I'm gonna be spending all night tonight reading through all these comments because it's Friday night. My birthday's this weekend, so I'm gonna hang out and just read comments. So, if you liked it, just let me know. I'd love to hear. All right. Okay, we're moving back into the JK5. I've got another picture for you. All right. This picture right here has 100% to do with funnels. So this is a picture at Funnel Hacking Live. You guys know I'm wearing a suit jacket. I've only worn a suit jacket like a couple times in my life. And this was one of them right here on stage. Inside the lining, it said Funnel Hacker, which is kind of cool. But this is me introducing it to the world, the new Traffic Secrets book. It was the first time we actually had a physical copy. In fact, we all showed in the box it. And this is the box right here that we showed them. So I showed everybody, like, this is the funnel. And this, it's interesting because a lot of times people think the funnel is just like, I have a funnel that's live. And it's like, no, the funnel is like the thing that converts somebody into a visitor, but the campaign of the funnel is how you get people excited. All the things you're doing up to it, right? Like building the hype and the promotion. Like you think about when a new movie comes out, right? I don't know what the big movies are right now. Like the movie doesn't just show up in the theaters, right? There's all the pre-work to get somebody into the funnel, right? Getting excitement, creating desire, creating anticipation, curiosity, excitement, right? There's trailers on TV. There's all of the actors are on talk shows, going around telling their story, showing little clips. All of this stuff to increase the excitement for the actual thing, right? And so for me, this is me getting ready and getting more people excited about coming to the Traffic Secrets funnel. And we have, anyway, the waiting list right now at trafficsecrets.com for people to be able to get access to the book is insanely big. And it's all because of all the things we're doing ahead of time to get people excited about the funnels that are coming up. So that's the pictures right here, me at Funalaki Live showing off the new Traffic Secrets book. All right. Now we've got some more to wisdom. All right, one of the people that I quoted a lot inside the Traffic Secrets book is my friend, Perry Belcher. Perry's one of the co-founders of Digital Marketer. One of the smartest people I've ever met in this business and definitely the funniest. So I tell a lot of stories about Perry inside Traffic Secrets. I've learned so many good things from him, but this is one word of wisdom I got from him that is inside the book that I think you're gonna love inside the Traffic Secrets book, but just something really powerful. So when I first met, not when I first met Perry, but when I first saw Perry socially, back when Twitter became the thing, right? So me guys don't remember back that far. He was out there doing Twitter, growing it really fast. And then at the backside of that, I did the same big webinar and did, I don't know how much money, millions of dollars in sales of this webinar. And at the same time, I was using Twitter and I was trying to like mark it to my Twitter following and making zero dollars. And I remember like, as an introvert, I didn't understand social media. I was confused, I was not having success with it. I was failing. I was like, this is the worst thing ever. Like I wanna go back to just hardcore buying ads, direct mail and phone calls. And then I asked Perry, I was like, how in the world have you had so much success on Twitter and all the social platforms? And he told me something that didn't make sense to me at the time, but since then it's become huge for me. Social networking is not about making money, it's about making friends. Okay, and he talked about how like, when you go to a party, it's funny, he's like, you know when you go to a networking party? I'm like, no, I'm an introvert, I don't go to networking parties. He's like, well, this is how it works. He's like, the guy walks into the room and starts talking about themselves and trying to pitch their product to everybody. Everyone shuns them and kind of hides them. Like you avoid that person. I never noticed who that guy is, right? Ah, there's the guy. The person who becomes the life of the party comes in there and tells stories, makes friends, introduces each other, makes connections and connects people, and it's like in there being social, like that's the person who wins the game, right? And so that's how social media works. You go in there and you do that. So he taught me that social networking is not about making money and spamming your links out there, which is what a lot of you guys are doing. I watch you all the time. It's about going in there and providing value, making friends. When you do that the right way, then the followers, the fans, the money, the cash, the traffic, all the other stuff will follow it. And so that's one lesson from Perry I learned. I go into a lot more detail of it inside the Traffic Seekers book. But thank you, Perry, for your words with him today. For all you guys understanding that, that's what social media is all about. It's not about making money, it's about making friends, which will then eventually turn into money. All right. If you like that, tell Perry down below. Say Perry, you're the man, and tag him. So he'll come and watch as well. All right, let's come back to our giveaway. So right now we've got tons of you guys sharing and I appreciate all the shares, but someone today is gonna be winning this box set of the Secrets Trilogy, which is Dotcom Secrets, Expert Secrets, Traffic Secrets, and the workbook that nobody else has seen yet called Unlock the Secrets.

You should tick talk about it. How about me? We have 275, let's get to 300. We have 275 shares, okay? We gotta get to 300 at least. We need at least 25. We got what? We got 400 people on right now? Come on, you guys, you gotta share this thing, because this is a gift. You aren't to do anything, you just share it. They came watching this crazy show right now. You guys can watch it if you wanna learn how to market your company, and people will come, and it'll be awesome. So that's the game plan right now. All right, share away. Okay, moving on to the next segment of the show. Alrighty, we're gonna be going into a top 10 list. So right now we're gonna go into a top 10 list. Top 10 ways to drive traffic into your sales funnel. Now all these are ways that we talk about inside the Traffic Secrets book. Obviously I go into a lot more detail in the book. I don't have as much time, so I'm gonna go through these kind of fast. I'm gonna go through 10 different ways to get people into your sales funnel, to get the wheels in your head spinning, so that hopefully you start driving more traffic in your funnels, and hopefully you get excited about getting your copy of the Traffic Secrets book when it goes live here in the little while. Okay, so top 10 ways to drive traffic into your sales funnel. Number one, you have to identify who is your dream customer. One of the biggest problems people have is they think the traffic's a magical, mystical thing. It's not. It's human beings, okay? And if you get the wrong human beings into your business, you will be miserable, okay? And so the very first exercise I have you do inside of, I believe the Dotcom Secrets book, is identify who is it you actually wanna serve. And so when I got started in the ClickFunnels business, before I had a business earlier that I was not happy with, the first thing I did, I said, okay, if I was designing my dream customer, what would they look like? And went to Google, I typed in a whole bunch of keywords. Like they would be successful, they'd be awesome. I wrote these things out. And then from there, I went to Google Images and I found two images, okay? And these are my actual customer avatars. I had these pictures printed on my wall for a long time. This was my avatar of Julie. I have no idea if this is actually, you should say hi, like I've been watching you on my wall for the last five or six years we built ClickFunnels. This is Julie, she's my dream customer. And this is Mike, my dream customer. I have no idea if their real name's Julie or Mike, but when I looked at them, I was like, these are the people I would love to hang out with. And so I said, I'm gonna design my company around these kind of people, right? So I had a picture on the wall of them and I said, we're building stuff like, okay, would Mike want this? Would he think that was cool? Would Julie actually buy this? Okay, if I did this, like what would they want in the experience? We started looking everything through that lens of my dream customers. That's step number one. Step number two, I have to know exactly who your dream customers are. Where are they hiding? Where are they hanging out online? The coolest thing about the internet is that people are self congregating themselves all over the place, right? Like I know for me, there's different congregations I'm part of, like there's the wrestling congregation. So me and all the wrestlers in the world are hanging out on like three different websites, right? I'm also into biohackers. I mean, all the biohackers and like three different websites over here. And you've got like the marketers over here and the self people are like, people are self congregating. So you gotta figure out who's your dream customer and then where in the world where are these people congregating? What are the websites that are on? And that's step number two, right? And then we're gonna throw our hooks out and grab them and get them and pull them into our finals. Step number one, who's your dream customer? Step number two, where are they hiding? Step number three, now that you know where they're hiding, right, now you gotta figure out how do I work my way in? So for example, let's say I know that all my dream customers are listening to this podcast, right? Like my favorite podcast is the Mixergy podcast. So I'll use that as an example. So Andrew Warner's got a really good podcast and on that podcast, I know my dream customers are listening. So how do I get on this podcast? What can I do? How can I work my way in? So I figured out, I give to no Andrew, I send him gifts in the mail, I call him on the phone, I call his producer, I say, hey, can I be on the show? Like here's the show idea, here's another show idea. And suddenly, hopefully he says yes and boom, I'm on the show. Now I'm working my way in to my dream customers. Okay, this is a free traffic strategy that anybody can use that's so simple, so easy. We drive hundreds of thousands of people every single year by doing nothing but free traffic strategies like this where I find out where's my dream customer and how do I work my way in to go present in front of them? Okay, and podcasting is an easy way, blogging, Facebook lives are easy ways to do that in any community, okay? That's step number three, step number four. Now that you know where they are, how do you buy your way in? Okay, Mixergy's another good example. I've been on the podcast three times now, I believe. So I've worked my way in, but guess what else? We also buy ads on the podcast. Like my dream customers are listening, let me buy ads, we buy ads, throw hooks in there, try to get our people and pull them into our world. Same thing with Entrepreneur on Fire with John Lee Dumas. Okay, JLD's podcast is awesome. I've worked my way in, we also buy ads on it, okay? Facebook, when we launched the expert secrets book right here, I did a Facebook live to Tony's audience. I worked my way in and then we also bought ads to Tony's followers and I bought my way in, right? So we work our way in and we buy our way in. The third thing is that as you're working your way and you're buying your way in, your goal of getting all this traffic is to convert it from traffic that you're either buying or that you're working your way into traffic that you own. Traffic you own is your own email list, okay? This is the most powerful, most important, most vital type of traffic is your own email list, okay? So I'm always trying to build my list, build my list. So I'm on the podcast, I'm sending people somewhere to go to join my list, right? I'm buying ads, I'm sending them somewhere to join my list. So all my focus point goes on converting traffic, all the other kinds of traffic in a traffic that I own, my own email list. And after I'm on my email list, that takes us to step number five, which is now I take them through what we call a follow-up funnel, okay? So again, come back here. Traffic that we earn, right? So I'm earning my traffic, here I'm controlling traffic and buying it. I'm putting them into front end funnels where I get these people to become the list that they join my list. Now they're on my, now they're traffic that I own. And from here I can send emails and I can send them to my front end funnels. I can send them to my upsells. I can send them to my back end funnels, right? And so my follow-up funnels, after I own the traffic, then I go and I send them to all the funnels here inside of my value ladder, okay? That is the magic of having a list. Over here, I gotta work really hard to get the traffic. Here I have to pay for it. But over here, I just log into my click-funnels account. I send an email and boom, the email goes out. Boom, and it sends to the next person, the next person. And this doesn't cost me any extra money. This is all free marketing, where everything you make is pure profit. Okay, that's step number six, follow-up funnels. Step number seven, then leveraging the big platforms, like Instagram, Facebook, right? I go to Instagram and I can buy ads. I can do partnerships with people. I can get them to promote me, have a link, then then pushes people into my page to build my following as well. And then from there, I can drive people into my different funnels, sending them to Facebook. Actually, Facebook Messenger. So I can have a Facebook Messenger bot on my fan page where someone comes in and they join. Now they're on my Messenger list, right? I can have it on my squeeze pages where someone comes and asks for the email address. I'll send it to Messenger and it adds that then to my Messenger list. Now I have a Messenger list I can send people to and push them into all my different funnels and my websites. Okay, next is Google. How do we get ranked organically on Google? And I wish I could spend a year on this. We have a whole chapter inside of the traffic secrets book about this. But basically, I'm going out and finding who's already ranking and then reverse engineering what they did to get to that spot. And then we go back and we reverse engineer it. We build a better skyscraper. Again, there's a whole technique that I could go into but we don't have all day. It goes deep into the traffic secrets book though. But we build a better skyscraper. We reverse engineer the linking strategy. We get that and we can bypass them and start getting traffic that was going to them to start coming to us instead. Okay, and then the last one here is YouTube. YouTube is such a powerful platform. It's the only platform where you create something and it grows over time. Right, I think about Facebook or Instagram. You create something and it drops in the feed and goes lower and lower at the point where it just disappears pretty much forever. Whereas YouTube, you create a video and you figure out the keywords people are searching for. You create that video, you post it and over time it grows. It gets more and more and more views which is why we spend so much time creating amazing YouTube videos because I know that the effort that goes into creating one doesn't just die after a couple of days. It actually grows throughout time. We have videos we've posted 10 years ago that still get traffic to this day. And so YouTube is the last of the 10 steps on how to drive traffic into your funnels. So affiliates are people who already have your dream customers on their list, right? And so like when we're launching the Traffic Secrets book right now, we have tons of people who already have email lists. They already have Facebook followings. They already have Instagram followings. They have these things. And so we're asking them to promote the book and then we pay them a percentage of all the sales that they make. And so having affiliates is one of the best ways to drive traffic into any funnel. In fact, the first five or six years of my business, this is how I focused most of my traffic was just on affiliates. I didn't have, I wasn't buying ads. I wasn't doing things. I was just focusing on building partnerships with people who have lists and then giving them to promote our products and our services and grow our companies. All right. You guys liking this? You guys liking this so far? If you are, comment down below. Let us know. I'm gonna be reading all the comments here in a minute. If you haven't shared yet, we're gonna give you away the box set here in a minute, but you gotta make sure you share it. That's a 365 shares. Yeah, man. Dang, that's like 100 shares in the last like few minutes. Thank you guys. Keep sharing, keep sharing. It means the world to me. Everyone who shares, John's gonna come to your house and bake you. No, that's not gonna happen. You should have John. John's amazing cook. He wants lights. Yeah. He wants a 65. One a day? One a day for next year. John will be at your house. His wife doesn't know yet, but it'll be awesome. All right. Moving on to the next of my JK5. So again, my categories I care the most about in life are family, funnels, faith, entrepreneurship, and personal development. I want to share with you guys another picture. This is a picture talking about faith. And I know faith in business, people get nervous talking about and sharing it, but it has such a huge role. I definitely believe that for all of us, our businesses are calling from God and that we've been called to serve a certain group of people and that the products and services that we create if we do it right, will change their lives. And so I'm a big believer in that. And I feel like, man, so many times in my life I've been inspired and led to do this, right? This work I'm doing right now is not something that came off the top of my head. So much inspiration. So many times you're sitting there praying, hoping for an idea, an idea pops in your head and you're like, oh my gosh, like, wow, I see the path forward right now. And so this is a picture at our recent Two Comic Club cruise. I spoke on stage, I do a midnight mastermind where I sip all night and it's really, really fun. So I do the midnight mastermind and afterwards, this guy came up and he thanked me for our service and said, do you mind if I pray with you? And I was like, I would love that. And so we sat down and we prayed over people we serve, the work we're doing, how we're trying to help people. And it was a really powerful moment. I didn't realize they caught on camera till later. And the funniest thing about this picture, if you notice, I have bare feet on it. I literally did the entire midnight mastermind presentation in my jammies, which was a lot of fun. So there's a picture about faith and how important it is to our businesses. Don't forget that because if you ask for help and guidance, he'll give it to you, I promise you that. All right. Next we've got words of wisdom. All right, this has gotta be, this is probably one of my favorite quotes that I found in the last year of my life as I was doing the Traffic Secrets book. It's from someone who is a Boise entrepreneur as well. He's both an amazing company called ConvertKit. Some of them look as competitors, but I look at them as a friend, Nathan Barry. And Nathan wrote a blog post and the title of the blog post was, endure long enough to get noticed. And it was amazing. I'll share a little part of the blog post. He said, how many great TV shows have you discovered in season three or later? I started watching Game of Thrones after they had released five seasons. Pat Flynn had released at least 100 episodes of his podcast before I even knew he existed. And he goes on and on talking about that and says that sometimes there's so much content being produced that what we do as humans is oftentimes we wait for the best stuff to rise to the top. And so for all of you guys who are right now and you're starting this journey and you're producing content and you're posting a blog or videos or you're vlogging or you're doing a podcast, whatever it is, right now people aren't listening. Like that's okay. The key is to be consistent with it. Consistency is the key. You gotta endure long enough to get noticed. When I launched my podcast, I launched at the back end of a business failure. I literally had let go 80 people that were working for me at the time. And I remember being depressed and sad and not knowing what to do anything. And also I felt this pull of like, you need to start a podcast. I'm like, what? This is the worst time to start a podcast. It's like, yeah, you should talk about marketing. I'm like, am I a good marketer? I just played off 80 people. I'm probably the worst market of all time. But I felt this pull of like, you need to start this podcast. And so at the time I started it while I was driving to work every day. So I was called the marketing in your car podcast. I would click record, I would drive to work and back. And I would just record this podcast as I was driving. And it's funny because I didn't know how to check stats the first couple of years, luckily. And probably two or three years into it, I had no idea people were listening. And I don't think they were at first. And eventually we got stats hooked up to it. And I found out later that we had tons of people listening, but it wasn't at first. And in fact, I remember Stephen Larson, he, you know, Stephen Larson's a big, you know, he's been following us for a long time. And he told me when he first started working for us, he said, I listened to probably the first 45, 50 episodes of your podcast. He's like, they weren't very good. And about 46, 47, like you start to find your voice and you started like to figure it out. And it made me think, I was like, man, I'm so grateful that I didn't know how many people were listening at first because if I would have, I probably would have quit. And I wouldn't have found my voice. I wouldn't have found my people. My people wouldn't have been able to find me. And so for you, for you, you got to start publishing and start doing it. First, it's going to be hard. No one's going to be listening. But this is your chance for you to find your voice, for you to figure out your message. And the more you do it, it gives your people a chance to actually find you. So once again, thank you, Nathan Barry, for this quote. Endure long enough to get noticed. One of my favorite quotes and something I think all of us should be thinking about as we're publishing, especially during times when it's hard and you feel like nobody's actually listening. All right. You love that quote post and tag Nathan Barry down below. All right, we're talking about the giveaway again. For those of you who don't know, we had a hundred more shares after last time. So how many of us want this shipped your house before anybody else? Who wants the very first copy ever? I could probably sign it. Should I sign it? Should we add some fuel? All right, this is okay. Oh no. It's two and a half months in each box. Okay, Melanie said I'm going to sign each of the books and the, how do you sign the box? We'll figure it out a way. I will spam this thing with my signature everywhere if that's something you actually want. So that's what we're going to do. We're going to ump at the end. We're making a little bit sexier. So this is the way it works. We're going to give away one of these boxes at the end of today's show. And the way to win it is simple as two steps. Step number one, you've got to share this presentation live right now while it's live. And step number two, after you've shared it, then you got to comment down below and just let us know that you shared it. That way we're going to sync. We're going to look at all the shares, the comments, sync it up, and then Melanie's going to pick a winner here before the show is done. So you got to hurry because like, we're getting, we're more than halfway through the show, I think. So like, if you don't hurry up, you're going to miss out your opportunity to win the sign. But not only is that the first box did it all the time, it's the only one that signed of all times. I'm probably never going to sign another box after this one. You probably sell it in eBay for like 50 bucks or something. So it's pretty cool. Anyway, that's how you do it. So share it and then comment down below, let us know when you have shared it. Does that sound good to you guys? Sounds awesome. All right, very, very cool. I'm talking really fast. It's going to be second to catch my breath. All right, here we go. Okay. All right, everybody, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome back. Right now we're going to be doing a training session called the classroom. We're walking us through some really, really cool stuff. So what we're talking about today is affiliate marketing 101. And this is not like how to be an affiliate. This is how to get affiliates to promote you. So how to fill your funnel with these free traffic secrets, which is really, really fun and exciting. Again, when I started my business, I didn't do it by buying Facebook ads, by Google ads, by YouTube ads. I didn't know how to do all that kind of stuff at first. I did it by finding affiliates and getting them to promote my products. So if anyone's looking for free traffic, this is the best way to get free traffic so I know it. Okay, so affiliates are me. Like what is affiliates? Affiliates are people who love your product, love your service and they decide that they're going to promote it for you. Right, they may already have an email list. They have a big follow on YouTube or Facebook or Instagram or something and they can go and they can promote it for you. So your job is to figure out who are the affiliates, who are the people I need to go find who already have my dream customers who can talk about my product or my service? Okay. And when I first got started in this game, man this is probably almost 15 years ago now. This was before I had any kind of business. I remember I was trying to learn this game and I was sure some of you guys are not smart now. You're trying to learn, you're trying to figure things out. And I was trying to learn traffic and it was confusing to me. I don't understand, there was PPC and SEO and all these things back then that everyone was doing to get traffic. And I remember that one day I was in this marketing forum back before people use Facebook groups as a forum and then this forum and someone asked the question of all the ways to drive traffic, which one is the best? I remember seeing that and I was like, oh my gosh, that's my question too. Like I don't have time to learn all of them. Like what's the best one to learn? So I logged into the question and I started reading all the responses and I was so crazy because one person came and said, the best way in the world is Google paper clicking. You know, someone else, no, no, no, that's the worst. Like the best is SEO and they're like, oh, that's good, but this type of SEO and like, no, you should be doing cloaking versus that. And like all these things, everyone's fighting over it. I'm just like, this is amazing. Watching all these traffic, we'll fight over the best way to get traffic. And I'm watching like thread after thread after thread and all of a sudden one person came in and dropped the mic. And it was the owner of the forum, probably the wealthiest guy who was in the group at the time. And he came in there and he posted a really short thing. He said, I rely on my own network of affiliates. I remember reading that at first I didn't get it. I was like, what? I rely on my network of affiliates. And I read it again and again and all of a sudden like the light bulb hit. I was like, oh my gosh, I can go out there and I can learn how to do solo ads. I can learn how to write and send emails. I can build emails. I can learn SEO. I can learn PBC. I can learn back and learn all these things. Or what if I went out and said, who already is really good at banner ads? What if I found that person and I said, hey, I'll pay you a percentage of all the sales if you do banner ads for me. Maybe I find three or four or five or 10 guys doing that. I just 10x my efforts. I didn't have to learn anything. Maybe I find the person who's really good at PBC instead of me learning PBC, let me find people who are already good at it and pay them a commission on every sell they make. And SEO and the same thing. And like that was the light bulb for me. I said, okay, I'm not gonna focus on new traffic strategies. I'm gonna focus on like finding those people who I can make my affiliates. And so this is something to understand. When you have an army of affiliates selling your products or services, you don't have to be good at everything. You can get army of affiliates to promote your products and your services with every type of traffic. They're the best at. They're the thing that they're most passionate about. Okay, all right, so this is how it works. Step number one, you gotta go recruit your army of affiliates, okay? This comes back to a concept we call the Dream 100. I spent a lot of time in the new traffic secrets book talking about the Dream 100. That's the first phase is like identifying who are the people who already have your customers, okay? If you don't know yet, like now's the time to start looking. Like go online and start Googling all the keywords that your dream customers with Google and then join the email list, follow the Facebook, the fan pages, join the groups. Like tie yourself into all the places that your dream customers probably going and like weave your way in there and also you start seeing like, oh my gosh, this person sending emails selling products similar to mine. Oh my gosh, this person's got a blog on page number one of Google for all the keywords that I would have searched for. Oh my gosh, this person has is good at SEO or PP, you know whatever it is. You start finding those people. So step number one is you gotta find them and you gotta recruit them. Okay, that means good old fashioned getting to know people. Which I get it for those who are my introverts. I'm super introverted as well. Scares me to have to call people on the phone but this is something that's worthwhile. I'll hit them up on Facebook Messenger or DM them, I'll call them on the phone, I'll send them pizzas in the mail. Like I do all sorts of crazy things to be able to recruit my affiliates and get to know them because people promote the people they have relationships with. So you need to get relationships with those affiliates who are part of your dream 100. Okay, Tim Ferris when he wrote the four hour work week, I told the story in the Traffic Seekers book. It was interesting, he spent a year, like as he was writing the book, he spent a year going out and meeting all the bloggers and getting to know them and became friends with them and built his relationship with all these bloggers. And when they asked him like, what do you do for a living? He's like, oh, I'm writing a book but you know, and that was kind of a kind of brushed it off. And then as the book got done, he sent his book to all these bloggers he built relationships with over the last year. So here's my new book, if you like it, I love if you wrote a blog post on launch day. If not, it's really cool. He sent that out and people read the book and they loved it. And day one launch day, he had hundreds of the top bloggers in the world, all right, blog post reviews about his book and the book went on to become New York Times bestseller and built Tim Ferriss, who is one of the biggest influencers in the world right now. But it all came off of him spending a year recruiting his army of affiliates, sending them out stuff to get to know them and build up relationships. So step number one, you got to identify your dream 100 and recruit them. Step number two, you actually make them an affiliate. So inside of ClickFunnels, if you have a ClickFunnels account, Backpack is the tool you can use that builds an affiliate program. So any funnel you have selling a product, you just hook a backpack to it and what happens is your affiliates can log in and they can go and grab a link right here and then they can promote it. You can put sample emails for them, sample a banner ads, things like that, they can go grab it, they can promote it. And then when they make a sale through their link, Backpack Software will track it and each month you can log in and says, okay, here's all the affiliates you need to send money to. You click a button, you'll send PayPal payments out to everybody, pays all the affiliates and that's how the affiliate platform works. So we call that Backpack inside of ClickFunnels. But after you find the affiliates, then you got to make them an affiliate. It's really easy to do inside of your ClickFunnels account. And then step number three, you have to give them a reason to promote. Why should they promote? Why should promote today versus tomorrow? Good affiliates are gonna hit it by everybody in the world to promote. So why should they promote your products? A couple of reasons. Number one, people like to promote something that's new, a new launch, right? They get excited about the newness of it. So they have a new launch. Number two is some people like, I don't like doing a launch so you can turn it into a rolling launch. It's like, hey, week number one, you're gonna be the affiliate promoter. So week number two, it'll be you. And week number three, and you pick different affiliates and do one little mini launch to each person's list one at a time. And then the third way, the third reason is that people love new stuff, right? So sometimes you can go to an affiliate and maybe they're not gonna promote your thing but make something new with them. Like, hey, how about you take your superpower, my superpower and make a product together and let's promote it to our people that way. And all of a sudden now you got something co-created that you can create new together that gives them a reason to wanna promote as well. Okay, step number four, now after you've done that, now you gotta train your affiliates, okay? Really good affiliates are lazy because they make so much money, they don't even care. And really bad affiliates don't know how to do it. So you gotta, either way, you need an affiliate training center which are really easy to build inside of ClickFunnels. This is what our affiliate training centers look like. You come in here and an affiliate can quickly come in here and get links to all the banner ads. You can have videos training them, you can teach people how to run Facebook ads, how to run banner ads, how to do SCL. Like, you can train affiliates, you don't know what they're doing yet. And then you make the training center, makes it super simple for your existing affiliates just to go in there, grab what they need, paste it, post it, and they can be on their way. So that's step number four is training your affiliates. And step number five then is then you actually pay your affiliates. People always ask me, how much do I have to pay my affiliates? I wanna pay them as little as possible because they wanna keep more money. You don't understand, like, you never wanna take away commissions from a salesperson, right? I wanna give people the biggest commissions possible. So when we launched ClickFunnels, looked at all the other software companies, most were paying like 15 or 20% of affiliate commission. I was like, okay, let's double that. So we did 40% of affiliate commission, which no one ever heard of before, right? And then we did the dream card bonus. We're actually paying people's dream cards when they promote. We tried to make it as lucrative as possible so that affiliates would promote us instead of our competitors. And what was crazy is that when we first got started, there were a bunch of competitors who had a lot of affiliates, we came in and paid more and we converted higher. And all of this shifted from those other companies and started promoting us instead, okay? And so the more you can pay your affiliates, the better. I typically try to pay my affiliates 50% of what we actually make on a product. So if I'm selling a digital product, what's 100% digital, I may be 50, 50 commissions. If it's a physical product, let's say I've got an e-commerce product where I've gotta pay 20% is the hard cost for the product, then I'll take the 20% off the top and I'll split whatever's left over 50, 50, right? I like to pay my affiliates at least that much. Sometimes though, when we have something like a book or a front end funnel, we may pay affiliates more. In fact, when we launched both the dotcom seekers book and the expert seekers book, we paid affiliates $20 to give away a free book where someone paid 7.95 shipping handling, we were paying affiliates $20. So we actually lost when we were paying 200% commission on it because we knew that they were gonna buy the product and some people bought upsells and downsells and they made it so we did break even. And then eventually people bought click funds in the back and that's how we made our money. So step number five is figuring out how to compensate your affiliates to motivate them to wanna be able to promote. And so that you guys is how you build an affiliate program which is getting one of the easiest, most powerful ways to get more traffic into all of your funnels. All right, we're back with some more pictures. You guys ready for some more? Okay. All right. Next I wanna show you guys a picture of my beautiful wife, Colette. This is the night before Funnel Hiking Live went on a river boat and this is a picture of us and it's fun because we got all dressed up and I don't normally wear suit jackets at all, let alone white suit jackets but they had me all dressed up nice and this is my wife and I, Colette. And it's interesting, I posted a quote that I said, you can only be as successful as your spouse will allow you to be. And people were like, why should you rely on your spouse? I mean, no, no, you don't get it. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying life is hard, right? Like if you wanna be successful in the business, like unfortunately that's not the only thing you're like. You have business, you have life, you have health, you have family, you have kids, you have religion, you have like there's all, there's so many things, right? People ask me the time, how are you able to juggle so many things at the same time? And the reason why is because I have an amazing support system, I have an amazing wife who allows me to do those things. I have a wife who like, when I'm like, I gotta go to Nashville for a week to teach an entrepreneur, she's like, okay, I can watch the kids or I'm gonna get someone to watch the kids, I'm gonna come support you, right? I have a wife who is amazing at those kind of things. And so, and the same thing is true for you. Like you can only be as successful as your spouse or your significant other will allow you to be. Otherwise it's always pulling at you, it's hard to do the things you need to do. Otherwise, if you're not carefully of a very lopsided life, I see some people who are really successful in business and every other part of the life sucks, right? Well, people have great families, but they're broke. And it's like, how do you have balance? How do you find things? And you can't do it by yourself. It's by finding amazing people, building support network around you. And it all starts initially with your spouse or significant other. And so I'm so grateful for my wife, Clette, who has allowed me to chase my dreams and follow my dreams and do the things that I've wanted to do. Super grateful for her, I love her. And this is a cool picture of me and her right before Funnel Hacking Live that kicked off last year. All right, next we've got a word of wisdom. Okay, I'm gonna show this one. This is one, I have an Inner Circle program and it's paused right now, but we had it open for a couple of years and we would, everyone in my Inner Circle would come twice a year here to Boise, Idaho. And one of the couples that joined were Nick and Amanda Barely. And they joined and just hit it off them really, really quickly. And when they were first speaking, I remember Nick said something on stage. Nicholas, he said, our mess becomes our message. I'd never heard that before. I don't know if he got it from somebody else, but I got it from him. And so I always give him credit for it. But he said that, and it was interesting because I started thinking about like in all of our lives, right? We have these callings, we have a business, we have a thing we're trying to do. And what's interesting is that most of us, like the thing that we're trying to do, it actually, typically it's not like the thing that, that we're the, how do I say it? We are like who our dream customers were five or six years ago, right? So I think about, for example, one example is Stacey and Paul Martino, one of my favorite couples in the Funnel Hacker community. You know, back, I don't know, 10, 15, 20 years ago, they were struggling their marriage. They were on the brink of divorce. They, everything was falling apart around them and they were in a mess and they figured out a way to not only solve the problem, to fix it and to make it better. And so they did that. And then instead of just like, cool, our marriage is happening, now let's leave, they're like, man, we learned some tools, we learned some things that can really change people's lives. What if we have, what if we share this with other people? And, and they started that and their business became their message, their mess became their message. I think about my own life, like, why am I teaching this stuff? Why am I so passionate about marketing? It's like, well, when I got started, I couldn't, that was the part I could understand. Like, I want to make money, I wanted to grow a company, but I couldn't understand the marketing part. And at first it wasn't fun for me, I didn't enjoy it, but then I started studying it and as I started learning some stuff, I like, you got me excited and started growing, like, it became my message. And now it's like, man, that's, it's the thing that I'm so passionate about. I think for all of us in your life, a lot of times the thing that you struggled with earlier in your life becomes your product, your service, your message, right? ClickFunnels literally came from, we were so frustrated for a decade of my life, building Funnels by hand, that was my mess. And then eventually we turned it into a software company that made it simple and that became our message, right? And so a lot of times in fact, I don't know what I'm gonna sell, what products or services I have, like look back in time, what was the mess that you worked through, and that can become your message. So thank you, Nick, for sharing that amazing quote with me. Your mess can become your message. Whew. All right, how's everybody doing? How's everybody feeling? Feeling good? We passed 400 shares. 400 shares, what? Love it, they're so great. Thank you guys. Should we do this more often? Do you guys like this? You okay if we go over to liver? You guys okay with that? Cause like we can stop if you want. Like I can go back to taking nap. Like I'm totally cool with that. Hopefully, hopefully you guys are all getting something good out of it today. 1,300 comments, 400 shares, really. 1,300 comments, 400 shares. Okay, I need some more, we need some more shares. So let's talk about the bribe again. There you go. Okay, this is the brand new Secrets trilogy with our secret work we've got nobody seen before. And at the end of this event, we're gonna be giving this away to somebody. Sign copies, I'm gonna be signing all four books and the box somehow. Show us again, cause this is really cool. It was inside this box earlier today. Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. This was the ClickFunnels mystery box. We opened it up and inside the mystery box for today was the Secrets trilogy box set. Okay, this box though will be coming soon to a funnel near you, but right now there's only one on this planet and we're gonna be giving this one away. Somebody's listening today. The way to win this is basically very simple. It's two steps, step from one. Share this video down below that you're participating in right now and then number two, comment down below. Let us know and that helps us get our message out to more people cause I'm working for 3D for you guys today. The least you can do is share it and then somebody's gonna win this as a gift. So, all right, there you go. Okay. Shaking the app. Just kidding, we gotta keep going. The show must go on. The NAP segment. Okay, this is the day. We're moving on to the NAP segment for the day. If anyone wants to grab your pillows and hang out, just kidding. Okay, you guys ready for the next segment of the show? Here we go. Okay. This is called, this is the title of this next segment. How hacking Facebook, Dropbox and Hotmail have earned us millions in free traffic secrets. All right, so as you guys know, there's this whole Funnel Hacker community. I am the original, the OG Funnel Hacker. What does Funnel Hacker mean? Some people would think it means going and stealing stuff. The answer is not that. Funnel Hacking is all about looking at what people are doing and modeling it. So as we're going to click Funnels, I'm looking at how, cause I'm not a coder, I'm not a programmer, I have no ability to actually code and make click funnels. People always tell me, Russell, thank you so much for building Click Funnels. I'm like, I don't know how to build Click Funnels. I have a genius named Todd Dickerson and a whole development team who built Click Funnels. I'm the dancing monkey on stage who gets to talk about it. Right? And my job was like, I got to figure out how to sell this thing. And so I'm looking at like, how do people sell software? I've never sold software before. I'm looking at, I looked at like, what does Facebook do? How does Dropbox, how do Hotmig, what do they do? They start looking at those things and Funnel Hacking the ideas. So I'm gonna share with you some of their ideas and then show you how we actually Funnel Hacking to grow Click Funnels. You guys wanna see that? All right, cool. To lead off this session, I wanna talk about one of my first early friends and mentors in this whole business. I got a name, Mike Filsey. This is Mike right here. And back in the day, he had a course called Butterfly Marketing, which is right here. And it was still one of my favorite courses of this day. I keep telling Mike, like you should write a book called Butterfly Marketing and bring these principles back. But it's been like almost a decade since they've been out there, but Butterfly Marketing was a great product. And some of the basic gist of it was he, in Butterfly Marketing, he talked about the butterfly effect. Some of you guys have heard this concept before, where a butterfly flaps its wings in San Francisco, which causes like a chain reaction events that turns into a tsunami on the other side of the world. Something like that. So that's the concept of Butterfly Marketing, of the butterfly effect. He said, took that to marketing. He said, well, maybe this is true marketing. Like, what are the little tweaks we can make on our pages or our funnels or our upsells that cause huge increase in profits in our business? In fact, Mike was one of the original originators of the OTO, the one time offer. He was the first person that showed it to me. Like, here's how you do an upsell. It's like, oh my gosh. And like adding that little thing in there, it changed everything for me, right? So it's these little tiny Butterfly Marketing techniques. So in fact, all you guys should tag Mike down below, at Mike Phil same or whatever, and like Mike, write a book called Butterfly Marketing. We all want to buy it. But that was kind of the concept. All these little things you can do that have huge dramatic impact in your business over time. And so a lot of these things that I saw Facebook and Dropbox and all these companies do, were like these little butterfly effects, okay? To make something truly viral, you have to get past a referral point. The Mark Joiner called the copulation rate, where the rate that your viral marketing grows. Okay, this is not planned, but I'm gonna explain how viruses work, according to my expertise. And since we're in the middle of the coronavirus, we might as well talk about this, right? Okay, just kidding. So what happens with the virus? Okay, let's say you have a thing, right? And so you have one person that goes into the thing. So for our intents and purposes, it's the landing page, right? So here's the landing page, your headline and somebody opts in, okay? And if every one person that comes in here, backside, zero people pop out. Or I guess you have, how do I explain this the best way? The copulation is how many people come back through, right? So if you have one person come in here and from there, maybe the word of mouth is like, well, that person, one out of 10 people tell someone else. And you have a 0.1% copulation rate, right? Because every person that comes through, every 10 people come through, one person will come back through and refer a friend and they come back in, right? So that's not viral growth, right? Because if I said 100 people means I'll get 10, those 10 I'll get one and eventually just kind of stagnates and dies, right? So the copulation rate is really low. But if I create something where one person comes in here and they refer one person, right? Then you have something that's not viral growth, but it's growth, right? If every one person joins, one person will come out and you have this thing just kind of flat lines, right? Which is kind of cool. But viral growth happens when you get one person come in and you get more than one person come back, right? So 1.1 or 1.2 or whatever that might be, is copulation rate. Now you send 100 people into here, right? And you get 101 people who come back through viral growth and then 200 and 300, like that's the whole mechanism. That's how a virus grows, right? And so in marketing, like the butterfly marketing effect and things like that, how do you create things that make it so that for every someone, everyone who joins your landing page, how do you get more people to come in? Everyone who joins click phones, how do I get more of them to come in? And to get true copulation rate, to get more than 100% referral is really, really difficult and doesn't happen very often. But even with that said, like what can we do to get this number from 0.1 to 0.5 to 0.7 to 0.8? So that, because anything that happens there is either that viral growth is just free traffic. So that's kind of the premise of what we're gonna be talking about during the session here. Okay, so to have something go truly viral, you need each person who comes into your funnel, into your world, into your product to refer more than one person. That's how you start growing virally, right? All right, so here's how Dropbox did initially. And you guys probably heard if you've following the growth hacking strategy, that's how Dropbox did it. Okay, so Dropbox came in, when a new user would sign up, they'd say, hey, if you tell your friends and your family by postings on Twitter and Facebook, we're gonna give you more storage for free. And then people did that and Dropbox grew, right? Because everyone's like, oh cool, I got, I don't know, we got 10 megs of free storage. If I post this on Twitter and Facebook, I get an extra 30 megs or gigs, whatever it was, right? And Dropbox did that. And that's how they went crazy, okay? For a while, they had true viral growth for every single person who got sent for Dropbox, they had to bring in three or four more people. And then boom, it became Dropbox, right? Viral growth. So that was the Dropbox hack that we learned. I was like, how can I apply that to ClickFunnels? I'll show you how we did here in a second. I was like, that's so cool, okay? Again, it helped Dropbox to go to over 500 million members worldwide, which is a lot of people. All right, here's the Facebook hack. Someone would join Facebook, okay, back in the early days. And I don't know if it still does this, could have enjoyed Facebook in 12 years. But back in the day, when you joined Facebook and you became a new user, it's like, hey, do you wanna see if your friends are on here? Click this button, we're gonna scrape your address book and see if your friends are on here. So scrape your address book, found all the people, and say, cool, here's all the people in your address book who are already part of Facebook. You want us to contact all the people who aren't and invite them as well? Like, sure, you click a button, boom, and they would go and invite all the non-Facebook users to come to Facebook and really quickly Facebook exploded because of using a viral growth hack like this, okay? Hotmail had a really cool growth hack as well, and probably heard this one as well. Hotmail came out and in every single email they sent out, they added a PS line, said, PS, I love you, get your free email at hotmail.com. And so what happens is that a group of people start using Hotmail and then they start seeing like, get your free email. Back in the day, email wasn't free and then people are like, oh, that's cool. So they signed up and they signed up and soon millions and millions and millions of people are all sending out emails to their friends, their family members, everyone they loved, all driving people back into Hotmail. And that little butterfly thing, that little hack, that little growth hack where everyone called it, dramatically increased how many people came into Hotmail. Okay, all right, so again, I'm looking at that as the original funnel hacker, like, how do I use these ideas? How can I use that to grow click funnels? And obviously I can't do the exact same thing, but like, how can I make something similar? So the first one, when we looked at Dropbox, we modeled Dropbox hack, right? So Dropbox, when someone came in and they sent it for Dropbox, they said, we'll give you more storage if you refer your friends. So when we initially launched ClickFunnels, it'd be the same thing. New users would come to ClickFunnels, we'd give them 20 funnels in their account. And then the first step, hey, if you refer your friends through Facebook or Twitter, whatever, we're gonna give you more funnels. So when they refer at least one friend, they dub, we'd dub with how many funnels they got. And then they had 40 funnels just by doing that. So when we first launched ClickFunnels, that's when we got tons of our initial viral growth is by modeling Dropbox's growth hack by doubling their funnels when they referred more people into the site. Which is how we got a lot of initial growth initially. Okay, next one's ClickFunnels plus Facebook's growth hack. The next thing we did is, I didn't have the technology like Facebook did to go and grab your address book and spam all your friends. I wish I did, because that'd be amazing. But we had to figure out how can we do something similar? So when we had our first webinar, people would sign up for the free webinar and then we'd give people a free 14-day trial to ClickFunnels. And after they joined the webinar, we would say, hey, if you refer five friends, we're gonna give you one of our products for free. And what happens when we register for the webinar, they refer five friends and they get the free 14-day trial. Those five friends would come back and they would join. They refer friends and what happens, we were looking at the time, I think about 20% of the traffic that were coming in to register for every webinar were not from our ads that we were spending. They were from the people who signed up for the webinar referring their friends back into it. So 20% of them lifted free traffic just by adding in a tele-friend script on the thank you page of our webinar. So again, we've used Facebook's growth hack. We modeled it, we tweaked it a little bit, put it on our page and got 20% more visitors for free to every one of our funnels that we were driving, people in the ClickFunnels at the time. All right, and then number, oh yeah, there you go, 20% in free signups. All right, and then this is the third last, this was my favorite one. You've probably seen this. We were looking at Hotmail, Hotmail had the PS, I love you, get your free Hotmail account here on every email. We said, what if we did it on ClickFunnels? So we created this little badge that's on every single page that says, built with ClickFunnels. And when you build a page by default on ClickFunnels, that badge is on there. And if you're building it, we plug your affiliate ID in there. So you get paid commissions when anyone, and there's some clicks on that and signs up for ClickFunnels. But we built that in day number one into ClickFunnels. So every page by default had it. And you can turn it off if you want, but it's there. And the results have been amazing. Over the past five years, the badge had generated over 10,000 people have joined ClickFunnels. That's a million dollars per month in revenue because of that little badge we put on there. Almost as an afterthought. Okay, that's $12 million per year right now in revenue. We get because we put that badge on there. Okay, these little butterfly effects, these little things that cause huge, huge changes in your business. And so for you, I want you to start thinking about that. In your businesses, in your funnels, and everything you're doing, what are little hacks, little butterfly effect things, little viral things you can add in there, that'll increase how much traffic you're getting. And as you're going through other people's signup flow, like watch what they're doing, be a funnel hacker, watch like, oh, that's how Dropbox did it. How can I apply that to what I'm doing? Oh, that's what Facebook did. How can I apply that to what I'm doing? Those little hacks had a dramatic increase on our company as a whole. It's fun because as you start looking at it that way, literally marketing is like hunting for buried treasure. As you're going through years, like you're looking for this thing like, where's the pot of gold? Oh, that I did, that's some gold, that's some gold, that's some gold, and you're finding all these things. And it's really, really fun. Okay, you guys ready for some more pictures? Yeah. All right, let's come back. All right, next picture here. Oh man, personal development. Boom. So this right here is Jamie Smith. Jamie has been a friend of ClickFun for a long time. He works here in the office as well. And he just moved to Boise recently, which is kind of fun. But Jamie is someone who we just love. So this is him winning his Two Comic Club award, or not Two Comic Club, sorry, this is him winning his dream car award for referring people into ClickFunnels. He also wanted to Comic Club award this year and a whole bunch of other different things as well. And so I want to share this picture because at Funnel Hacking Live, we're always working at like, how do we get people to the next level, right? How do we help them? I wrote about this in the new version of Expert Secrets, but there's a quote from Napoleon Bonaparte who says, it's something to the effect of like, it's amazing what men will do for a ribbon or for a, I can't remember the quote exactly, but conceptually it was that, right? And so it's interesting in all of our communities, one of the things we need to be doing is like creating awards, creating ribbons, creating things to get our people to go on this journey. A lot of times it's tough because someone will come into, they start a business, they want to lose weight or something and they don't have a tangible goal. The goal is like, I want to lose weight, I want to make money, I want to do whatever. And so they start on this journey, but there's never really an ending point. And so for us, it's that click phones, like how do we create awards that are like, where someone can go and they can celebrate and be like, yes, I made it to this phase. What's the award? What's the award? Because in business, like what's the, there's no like, there's no end game. Like in wrestling, it was like, I wanted to win state. I wanted to, I want to be an all American. I want to, you know, I had these things I was working towards. But in business, like I want to make money. And it's like, okay, this is a journey that you go on for forever. There's no, there's no end that just keeps happening. It's like the song that never ends, right? And I think a lot of times your customers come into your role the same way. But like, like, if there's no ending, why do I stay? And like, and how does it, you know, like what's the purpose of it? And so as you create these things, like we, and we have a dream car winner for affiliates, we have our two comic club, two comic club X, two comic club C, eventually we'll have a three comic club award. These are things that get your audience and pulls them. It helps you so you can develop them personally and take them to each step and take them to the next level. And so I've watched Jamie, for example, in this picture over the years, as he went and like, I want to win a dream car and then he won it. I want to win two comic book award and then he did it. And it helps, it helps develop your audience and your team and your people as well. Jamie Smith. It's amazing what a man will do for a piece of colored ribbon. Yes, it's amazing what a man will do for a piece of colored ribbon. That's such a good quote. And it's in the new X for Secrets books. When you guys read the new version, which you all better read it, that is what's happening. Okay. And we've got our last word of wisdom for the day. Okay. This is one that's very important. As I rewrote the dot com secrets and the X for Secrets and then wrote the new version of the X, of the traffic secrets book, there's one concept that wasn't in either of the first two books. It's now in all three of the books because it's literally the most important part. And so if any of your traffic campaigns or any of your funnels aren't working, it's always because of the hook, the story or the offer. Okay. If you're a funnel like live two years ago, you heard me, I did a whole presentation on this, but hook story offer is the key to marketing. It's interesting if you look at every phase of your funnel like the ad, like is the ad working? Yes or no. If the ad's not working, it's always either the hook, the story, or the offer. So you look at like, is the hook, is it grabbing people? Is the story building perceived value in the offer? And is the offer any good? Okay. And you get the landing page and the landing page is the hook story offer. Okay. After an ops in there, the first email is hook story offer. The first, the sales page is the hook story offer. The upsell page is a hook story offer everywhere. And so when you look at your, your campaigns as the holy drive traffic and something, it's not working for some reason. It's always because the hook, the story or the offer. It's, it's interesting. People will hire me for consulting and it's ridiculous now. Like it's cause I don't have time to do it. So we just kept raising the prices, thinking that people would stop, but literally like the going price, like a hundred grand for a day consulting right now. And it's funny that people come in like, my phone's not working. Just look at it and tell me the magic. Like what's the thing I need to tweak? And I literally, it's just how simple this case. I'm gonna save you guys a hundred grand right now. All I do is look at the ad. I'm like, huh, the ad's not working. Is it the hook, the story or the offer? And I like, look at them. They're like, the hook's not that good. Like, what would be a better hook? And they're like, what if I tried this? Like, I don't know. Let's try it. Right. And then the landing page, landing page isn't working. Oh, see the hook, the story, the offer. What do you think about the hook here? Looks good, but man, the story kind of sucks. You know, like, how would you tell a better story? And that's all we do. That's it. That's the magic. Okay. You've seen behind the curtain. That's what the Wizard of Oz does. He looks at every single step in the funnel and says, what's the hook, the story, and the offer? That's it. That's the magic tricks. For you guys to understand this and to master it, the more you do, the better you'll be at driving the ads and building funnels, all sorts of things. Again, when you have a chance to read the Doc-Hum Seekers book, the new experts Seekers book, the new traffic Seekers book, this concept is weaved into all three of the books because it is the overlying thing that weaves between all the pages of your funnel. And so what's nice about it is if your funnels are working, it's because your hook's right, your story's right, and your offer's right. If they're not, it's because your hook's wrong, or the story's wrong, or the offer's wrong. And usually if you fix that and diagnose that, it becomes real easy. It's not like going to the doctor or the doctor's like, well, it could be this, and like eight million things that could be wrong. It's like, no, it's only three every single time. So when you understand that, it makes this whole game of funnels and business a lot more fun and a lot easier. There you go, hook's story offer. All right. Is this the last giveaway? The last giveaway. What's the last? So are we awarding right now? What's that? Are we awarding it right now? Oh my, yeah, actually. Yeah, actually, do it. We can't right now, yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Yeah, I've got a tool here. Okay. I'm pulling a ball in the coming. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Actually, let's, let's, oh, they got a winner. They got one. We got one? Don't share it again then, you can just don't share if you want. Okay. So Vanna, are you coming? Melannie's playing Vanna White today. Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. Okay, so everyone, this is Melannie, my assistant, who's here today to announce our winner of the first ever box O book. The trilogy box set. So Melannie, do you wanna, we should do a drum roll or something? Okay, here's the drum roll. Okay, hold on. So what this means, they're gonna get the box set. We're, I'm gonna sign all the books. I have a nice pen that'll work on this one for you. Do you do it on the outside or do the inside? No. Okay, so we're gonna sign it, like a silver pen? Yeah. Okay, that's gonna be awesome actually. Oh, that's really cool. Okay, so thank you guys so much for being on the show and for sharing. We're not done yet with the show, but we are gonna be announcing the winner now. So Melannie's got the winner. Drum roll please, who is the winner of today's? The winner is Kimberly Smith Austin. Kimberly Smith Austin, congratulations. You're the winner of the first ever box set ever. So cool, so exciting. That's exciting. Well, thank you for sharing, I appreciate that. All right, well Melannie's out. Everyone tell Melannie thanks John below for being part of the very first one ever. So that was fun. All right, appreciate that more often. We should just keep giving stuff away. Yes. Okay, all right, there you go. Let me see what's up next. We got a couple more things and then we'll be wrapping for today. And then those of you guys who've been on the show before, you can hang out for behind the scenes afterwards as we do all the little pieces. So, oh yes, okay. We've got a one funnel waste tour for you guys today. Every single morning here at ClickFun on stage Q, we do a live meeting with everybody in the company. We always share a story of someone in the funnel acting community who's having success. And it's so much fun. And I wish I could like broadcast those to all of you guys all the time. There's so many good ones. But we found one that I'm gonna share with you guys today which would be really, really fun. So this is from Heidi. And I wrote out the story. Probably the whole thing is kind of long, but this is Heidi right here. And so let me tell you her one funnel way story. It says, the one funnel way challenge was invaluable and crucial to my success with using ClickFunnels. Because before I did OFA, I didn't have a full understanding of how to create a great offer, how to construct a funnel and how to write the copy. If you saw them, the one funnel way challenge by now, if you haven't like, it's probably one of the best things we do and it's live training and it's starting, the next one's starting really soon. So go to onefunnelway.com. Sorry, that stuff is all key. But what a lot of people struggle with after the challenge is over, is how exactly to drive traffic to the shiny new funnels. That's why the traffic portion of OFA is so key. Because of what I learned, I was able to drive traffic to all my offers and funnels with zero ad spend. It was all organic through my Facebook profile, compelling social posts and my Facebook group. I'm super excited to learn all the other tactics to rustle us up as sleeve, of my sleeve and new traffic secrets to help us find an even greater success from Heidi Anspina. So thank you, Heidi, congratulations. Thank you guys for sharing that and keep sending in your onefunnelway stories. We love it, like as a company, you have no idea how it fuels this. We always share the story and talk about how what we do matters. And so this is one example of some of the amazing stories coming through. And so congratulations, Heidi, on your onefunnelway story. We did it, you guys. That's the last slide, right? We did it. How'd you guys like the second ever Market Seekers Live show? If you did like it, please let me know in the comments down below to see if we're gonna keep on doing this fun thing. So I'm gonna do some final thoughts before we kind of break. The reason why I started doing this show, just so you guys are fully aware, inside the Traffic Seekers book, we talk a lot about different advertising platforms and how things work, how to publish on all different channels. And one thing that's been interesting over the last four or five years we've been doing this at a big scale with ClickFunnels, is understanding like, you can't just create a video and then repurpose it everywhere. We tried that in the past, it was hard. Cause every social platform has its own language, has its own five and the way that things are produced, right? Like YouTube is very much how-to based. Whereas Pinterest, you're looking for cool images. Whereas Instagram, you're looking for galleries and stories and they're all similar, but they're all different. So they're making one video and then repurposing it everywhere. Usually you'll dominate really well. On platform and you'll struggle with all the rest cause all the rest is foreign, right? Like I see people take YouTube videos and post them on a podcast. And the podcast, like when I'm consuming a podcast, I'm not looking for like a step-by-step how-to tutorial. Like it would be on YouTube and vice versa, right? And so as I was writing the book, I was like, how do we make something that's gonna be easier for us and for everybody else? Cause it's hard to go and publish on 50 different networks. And so we've had the idea like, what if we did a show where had different segments and each segment of the show was focused on, on creating content for a specific platform. So if you guys watched this, hopefully you saw like, there were things very specifically we did that are gonna be repurposed and used on Instagram. There were things very specifically that would be just on YouTube. Things that would be just for blog posts and things like that. And so that's kind of a hint. You'll read about it when you get the new Traffic Secrets book. That's kind of what we're doing and why we're doing it. And hopefully you guys enjoyed the show today. It was a lot of fun.
