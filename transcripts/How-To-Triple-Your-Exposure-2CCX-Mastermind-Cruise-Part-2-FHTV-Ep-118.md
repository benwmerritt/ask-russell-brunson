Those are the people you take advice from. What is the next step? So I want you to do it. I want you to stand up. I want you to put your hands together for Miss Julie Stoyn right there, everybody! So I want to talk about two really big problems that entrepreneurs have. The first is perfectionism. And the one over here is when we try to cut too many corners because we're in that desperate situation where we're trying to make money and we're trying to get things done fast. It's like growth hacking gone bad, right? We start creating really crappy foundations for our business. And over here is perfection. This is like obsession. This is when nothing gets launched or you're constantly throwing things away. So products with shortcuts are crappy products. Products with a perfectionistic owner don't ever see the light of day. There are two truths that you have to hold in tension. The first is that you should take action as fast as possible with a minimum viable product and you should not worry about it being perfect. What is on this other zone? This is the other tension. This is the other truth over delivery, excellence, all that kind of stuff. When you can do both well because they seem like at first they're in competition with each other, right? Minimum viable product doesn't have to be perfect but I thought we were supposed to over deliver and be awesome and create a new opportunity. It can't be improvement. It has to be amazing, right? These two things are both true. They hold in tension and when you can stay comfortable in that tension you will be far more productive than if you start to fall outside of that. We just flew over that and it's a full rainbow now. It literally just got better. And then what happened? Then cops showed up. Luckily they didn't see anything, right? Well, they didn't see anything yet. We think we're okay. The rate. There. Be cool. You don't look like filmmakers, I think. My name's Miles and I'm a filmer,ographer. What's your name? I'm Dan. I'm Dan Usher. I don't wear sunscreen. I love filming cool stuff. I fly drones through rainbows and stuff. Made personal privacy quite a bit. Sam, where's Sam? Yeah, my name's Sam. I help him with all the criminal activity that we do when it comes to filmmaking. Today we are in St. Thomas. It's gonna be amazing. There's some really cool things we're gonna learn about the island which I have no idea about because I've never been here before so I'm super stoked to be here. It says some of the trees kill you so I'm hoping we survive. We're here to get one shot of Russell speaking in line for the 2018 year review video. The only problem is we're going into this. That's rain. That's a lot of rain. Like, point at it and then a freak on the field. Okay, above or back? Above. Okay. Which motivates us with lots of crazy stuff like kayaking in a storm. If you haven't yet, click above to subscribe. Subscribe. It was rad. It was actually pretty cool, man. That was a good shoulder workout for me. Twice I pinched Collette and she thought it was a shark so that was the best part. There's crabs all over it. There's hermit crabs crawling around. We're about to start the hermit crab race. I want you guys to find a fast crab. You're looking for one with mental toughness and good people skills. Start your engines. In three, two, one, let's go. Come on, monster. Come on, Bagheera. Bagheera? That's a great name, Cal. Come here, come here, come here. I'm gonna get some. The outer circle. The first one to get to the outer circle first. Here's the checkered flag. Yeah! Woo! I won. That's my boy. That's my boy. We came here. We kayaked, then we hiked. Two quiches by the blow hole. Grinch just all. We got so good a way. Which is a lot of fun. And now we're back. I think we'll find something to eat and then we're back on the boat. So that's the game plan now. Let's put our hands together for Mr. Stephen Larson. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Thank you very much. Woo! Okay. Questions, invite, revelation. And a lot of the time, the reason why people are not successful in this is they have no idea what they're trying to solve. If you don't know the problem you're trying to go solve, I'm gonna consume everything. I'm gonna read everything. I'm gonna take in every guru. I'm gonna go through every single course. Even though Russell gave us this amazing framework, I'm like, look, pathway, this square, there's literally check boxes. I'm still gonna go consume all of it. Go on every single Facebook live. Stop learning everything. Don't learn. I do not learn generally, like in a general sphere anymore. You have got to know the immediate problem you're trying to solve in front of you. This is cool because it gives you clarity and emotional license to drop off all the other garbage and noise that runs inside of our heads. Nothing else matters. Any other spur of the moment that looks attractive kind of opportunity that pops in my way? No. No. No. No. Because I don't know how to solve that yet. Let me get distracted by another course, another thing, another thing, another thing. It's not that they're not helpful. It's that for you to actually make money, it is likely not the answer. Okay. It is what is the next step. Right? And then what's the next step? And you're never going to see all of them. Ever. I never do. I have an idea of what I want to build this year. And some of it just scares the crap out of me because I'm like, oh, okay. I'm really pumped about it. I know where I'm going to go in between. There's a lot of unknowns. Welcome entrepreneurship. Okay. Ambituity land. All right. And so all I do is focus on the three steps that I... All right. I kind of know the three things I need to do. All right. That means I know everything I need to know. Okay. I have everything I need to do. And I just take that one step. Crap. How do I place that? Book, book, book, book, book, book, book, book, hunt, hunt, hunt, hunt. Next step. Okay. And that's how you do that. I really appreciate you guys and hopefully I'll stop by. So Russell got his books this morning. He had a huge stack of them and he went out on a speedboat and he hit them personally. Nobody knows where they are. And now we're sailing out as the two comma club, the two comma club pirates to find these special books and secrets hidden along the Bahamas. We don't know where they are, but it's our mission to find them. Hey, we've been here. We've been here the entire time. Oh, damn. All right. The cruise ship just landed in the South. We just jumped off for finding some taxis right now to head over to Atlantis where we are going to get some videos, have some fun and hopefully swim with some sharks. What are you up to right now? We're about to go down a water slide to shoot you through a shark tank, an actual shark tank. It's really awesome. Sponsors suck at vacations typically. So that's why we act like we're vacationing while we're making videos the whole time. So people think we're relaxing. We are producing memory spade videos last forever. Unless YouTube shuts you down. That's the best sense. Is this the spot, Dan? It works. It's just a bit intense. I hope we don't lose a laptop. All right, check this out. So he's got his phone with the lines right there on the phone. It's like a thing into the funnel and it increases how much money you make and how you get more emails. I got this. Oh, thank you. Over the years, we've gotten a ton of great feedback from you guys, which is why we've worked hard this year to deliver over 290 updates. Desktop notifications. I don't know where to go. So you're an entrepreneur and you don't use click funnels? I've never even heard of click funnels. Is that like, lead pages? No. My first big financial aha was this. It is easier to make a lot of money in a short period of time than it is to make a little money over a long period of time. That was my first financial breakthrough. Any track stars in here? Where are my track stars? Rand Track in high school. Anybody? What is your name, sir? Brendan. Brendan. Brendan. What did you run? Triple jump. Triple jump. 4x1. So I had polio as an infant. I've had a mental brace in my leg my whole life. I did not run track. So let's say Brendan and I, we get in a race and we're going to do a mile race. Can you run a mile? Yes. Okay. So we're going to do a mile. But how many of you would agree that it wouldn't be fair for Brendan and I to go the same distance? Yes? Okay. So, Brendan, you said you can run a mile, right? Yes. Okay, he's going to run a mile. I'm going to go two miles. Oh, crap. I'm so dyslexic. Did I say it backwards? I said it backwards. Anyway, but I'm stuck with it because I'm a man of my word. So, how many of you all know Brendan's going to win? Yes? Right. Brendan's going to win, right? Everybody say unless. Unless. Unless Brendan's running and Myron's on a bicycle. Because I said he's going to run a mile, said I'm going to go two miles. Now watch this. I can go farther, faster, and use less energy because you can always make up and leverage what you lack in ability. And so many people go through life trying to improve abilities that they don't have instead of looking for leverage to compensate for the things they don't have. See, what most people won't do is they won't stop running hard long enough to find leverage that can get them to where they desire to go that much faster. So, it's easier to make a lot of money in a short period of time than it is to make a little money over a long period of time. But you have to stop running and start looking for leverage. So that's some wealth mindset stuff that hopefully helps them out. Yeah! What are you about to do? Oh, we're about to do this funnel right here. Never done this before. We got the four of us boys ready to go. And conditions are a little windy, huh? It's a bit windy out here. We're going to have a good time. We're going to have a good time. Wow! One foot of the wing! You guys know we're going to learn traffic today. We're actually now we're in like dance instruction. And forward and back and side, close side and back, right, forward, left, side, close, side. You guys getting it? Yeah! Okay, give him a hand. Looking good, looking good. Hey, we're on vacation, right? Right headline on the spot. The magic trifecta that Russell Brunson uses to triple his content production by only working once. You want to know that? Yes. Okay. The what, why and how trifecta. Okay? Funnel hacking, right? Funnel hacking. Watching what Russell does, seeing the funnels that he builds, buying them, what are the upsells, how does he do it, what's happening. That's the what. What's coming out, right? What's being released, what's being produced? They say he also produces a how. And you'll see that on Funnel Hacker TV, right? You'll see him vlog and you'll watch how he's producing the what. And then you tune into his podcast and in his podcast you'll notice it's different in his podcast. The Funnel Hacker TV is very surface level how. Oh look, here's what Dave's doing, oh here's what Russell's doing, here's what Julie's doing today, here's what John's doing and all these things and here's how the team's interacting and I'm traveling over here and this is the how and how I produce what ends up getting delivered to the world, right? But his podcast is where you get a one on one in Russell's brain, why? Why he's doing it, why he's doing it the way he's doing it, what he's thinking about to produce, you know, like why he's going through the how to produce the what. But what if you could double your followers' engagement and depth of understanding you and connecting with you by producing a how type thing. You can do whatever you want, you can do Facebook live, whatever makes sense to you. You don't have to be a vlog, maybe you want to do a vlog, right? And then how and then why aren't you also doing a why, you know, a why? So this trifecta right here, you're already doing the what and you're already doing the stuff, just record it, be vulnerable, be open and record yourself doing the thing that you're going to sell and then talk to people as to why you're doing the thing that you're going to sell and you're already doing it anyway, imagine if you just have someone hold the camera or whatever and talk a little bit more and now you've tripled the exposure people have to you without doing anything more. Is that cool? Yeah. Woo! Awesome you guys, let's give it up for Mr. John Poox right here. Hey, I heard two comma club guys are doing karaoke tonight, so let's go inside to hear how that sounds like. All the friendships like we made here this week with each and every one of you. So Louis, thank you. You know, a year ago we first started talking about this, we had this vision like wouldn't that be cool if we did a cruise and I was honestly, because the introvert of me was like nervous about it, but now 12 months later having it happen and having the experience of everybody, I wouldn't change it for anything, it's such a good time and I think everybody grew a ton while being here on the boat. I'm away! And I think the biggest and the best business partnerships and deals happen in a situation like this where you can get past the formal like hi, how you doing and like actually finding who people are, what they care about and how you can serve them, how they can serve you and it just changes the game completely from a business partnership and friendship standpoint. You're able to put your guard down and relax and really connect because you're sharing these amazing new experiences together. I hope that you can put this in your calendar for next year, make it a goal to be on the two comma club cruise because listen to the experience that will completely change your business and it will probably change life as well. Big finals forever baby!
