Before hustle culture, before social media, before Tony Robbins, Mel Robbins, Jim Rohn, before all of the personal development people you know and you love who've changed this world. Back in the late 1800s, there was one book that started it all. And that book, self-help by Samuel Smiles. I bought this copy for $80. It wasn't too expensive. It does have a new binding. Whoever bound this one has put on a new cover and it's just, it's a beautiful book. And back then, people weren't talking about personal development. They weren't talking about success. It was not something that was ever published. It wasn't a thing, right? People were kind of doing their own things. And Samuel Smiles was a successful man. And somewhere in his journey, there were a group of like young men and they wanted them to speak to them about how to be successful. And so he came this group and he started teaching these principles. And it was received so well from these guys who was teaching that he was like, I should put it into a book. And so he wrote this book. The book, funny enough, is called self-help. Nowadays, there's like, there's a whole genre called self-help, right? There's like the section of the books are called self-help. People talk about self-help authors and self-help movements, all sorts of, but the phrase self-help, I believe, was coined by Samuel Smiles. He was the first one to ever say that and talk about it. In his life, he ends up publishing a lot of other books about successful people and how they were found success and stuff like that. But this book self-help is special, not just to me, but hopefully to everybody here that has ever had success or ever had personal development changed their life. Because after he wrote this book, he sold a bunch of them and then he passes away. And one copy of this book, one of the original copies, finds its way into the attic of a guy named Orson Swett Martin. And Orson Swett Martin finds his book, he reads it, and it completely radically changes his life. He realizes that that you could actually, by thinking different, by acting different, you can change your life. And then based on that, he decides he wants to be a publisher. He wants to share stuff. And so he started writing a bunch of books, wrote a bunch of things, and eventually Orson Swett Martin wrote a magazine, you may have heard of it called Success Magazine. He launched Success Magazine. It gets published all around the United States and literally transforms our country from the ground up. It changes people from thinking that a lot in life was based on their circumstances to understanding you can be successful by changing your thoughts and your actions. From the Success Magazine is where all the other new thought leaders we know like Napoleon Hill and all these other people sprouted up and they came into existence writing all these other books that we still read today, you know, Thinking Grow Rich, How to Win Friends and Influence People from Del Carnegay, all these other people that transitioned and changed how America thinks all originally came from one guy in the UK who wrote a little book called Self Help. If you want to read a copy of this book, it's good, but also realize it was written in kind of older English. When I first tried to start reading, I was like, this is really hard to actually read, but there's some really powerful things that are in here. And he talks about a lot of just a lot of really cool stuff. You also think about the time back then and people were in industry, it was it was different than nowadays, right? And so a lot of things he's speaking to are very specific to like how to be successful in your trades and your industry and things like that. But one of the things that I think was really interesting, really powerful, when he gets chapter seven, he starts talking about models. And this was fun for me because when I first started learning personal development, obviously the person in our era who is the king of it all is Tony Robbins. And I went to my very first Tony Robbins event called UPW. We got to walk on fire. It was so cool. And one of the things that Tony said that had such a profound impact on me, like it's something that I realized later, I had done it in areas of my life where I was successful. I had done it in wrestling. I'd done it starting my business, but I didn't know that that was like the secret until he said it, right? He's talking about modeling, just like Samuel Smiles was here in self help. But what Tony says, he says, if you want to be successful in anything, find someone who's already had success in that thing and then model it. I realized I was like, Oh my gosh, that's the big secret, right? Like we keep thinking we have to rediscover, reinvent these things or figure out how to do, you know, how to be successful, make more money, how to lose weight, where it's like people have already figured these things out. And so if you know you want to be successful, you have to find someone who's already had success in that thing and then model, like just follow them, go work for them, go be around them, like whatever it is, because as you're around other people, that's how you'll become more successful. And you'll start thinking like they do, start acting like they do. And so in this book, he's talking about, about modeling and the power of it. In fact, after he wrote this book, he published a book series called Life of the Engineers. Nowadays, we don't study engineers typically back then, they were the industrious, they were the ones who were the most successful, making the most amount of money, right? So we interview these different engineers and you write books about their lives specifically. So then he'd give it to people and they could read it because most people back then, they didn't have the internet, they didn't have TV, they didn't have these things to learn about how other people are successful. So he was right, he was taking these people's lives documenting them and then putting them in a book format. So someone else could read it back, wow, I didn't realize that's how that person thought. I didn't realize that's what they were doing. And then it gave people the ability to model because he was writing these books and giving it to them in a way where he was able to hand these, you know, these success stories over to people. I think that's one of the things that we probably take for granted a lot nowadays is the fact that we have so many different people who are successful, we can look at, we can see them online, we can read their books, we can do all sorts of stuff. But back then it wasn't nearly as big of a thing. Again, there's so many great self-help principles. And if you study any great self-help teacher or guru or author nowadays, they all have a lot of different things. But if you look at like the foundational and the most simple ones to really think about is what Samuel Smiles talked about here, which is modeling. So many different tactics and techniques. But when you come down to that, it becomes really simple, right? It's like find someone who's already doing what you want to do and then model them. And find the right role models, find people that you want to study with. If you're going to find someone who's going to be your mentor, someone you're going to model, it's like spending the time like, does this person actually have what I want when all of a sudden done? Like if you value having a family, does that person have a family? If you value having faith, does that person have faith? If you value making money, they have money. If you value like health, do they have health? Like it's figuring out like learning more about the person before you go too deep because sometimes you model behaviors that may be rewarded externally, but can actually destroy you internally. One of the key like principles is self-help is understanding that like you're in charge of your destiny. I remember a couple of years ago when Tony Robbins, Dean Grasioce and I launched a company together called Mastermind.com. Probably you've seen it in one of the big premises when we did that whole launch was helping people understand that like self-help, self-education like is the most powerful thing in the world. It used to be back when our parents were kids that the way you were successful life is you'd go and you'd go to school and you get education, you learn a skill set and then you give a job and you work for 100 years, then you'd retire. Well nowadays it's not that way, right? Nowadays self-education is the most important type of education. One thing Samuel Smiles talks about even back then, like he saw before most people understood it. By going to school, you'll learn the step-by-step things that you need for, you know, maybe for a specific profession or something, but you're getting the same information that everybody else is getting. So kind of on the same playing field and if you look at how schools are built at least here in America, they weren't necessarily built for teaching someone how to get rich or how to be successful or how to be healthy. Like nowadays it's so simple with the internet, right? You want to learn something on a topic, you can become the best in the world in such a short period of time. If you want to learn a little more about this book, you don't want to read the whole thing because this is kind of a heavy read. We did put some notes of my favorite things that came from the self-help book by Samuel Smiles and just realized again, this book, it is the catalyst that launched the self-help industry here in America. There's some people who love self-help, some people hate it, but self-help radically transformed and changed my life and I'm grateful for Samuel Smiles for developing this and turning it into an industry.
