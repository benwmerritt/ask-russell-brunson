## Transcript
I want to explain to you really quickly what the only thing is is keeping you from your goals, right? All of us have these big goals and these dreams and desires and things we want to accomplish and we'll go out there and start pursuing it and for some reason we don't ever get to the finish line. We don't ever get to the end, right? The question is why? Like what am I doing wrong? What am I missing? Recently I had a chance to speak in front of a whole bunch of young entrepreneurs and I wanted to help them understand the thing that's holding them back. Understand the things that are happening inside their brain, inside their mind, they're keeping them from being successful because if you understand these things, it gives you the ability to shift them and to change them so you can actually be successful. I remember the very first time I had a chance to talk with Tony Robbins and I asked him like why? Like I'm teaching people how to be successful in life, like why are they not figuring these things out and he told me something really fascinating. He said that only 10% of what you teach someone is the tactics, right? And 90% of your success is the psychology. Things are happening in your brain. If you understand how to master your brain, then it's easy to become successful in any area of life that you want. You could be in athletics, you could be in business, you could be in anything. So this presentation I want to show you is one that I gave to a group of young entrepreneurs who we liken the mind to an elephant, a couple of monkeys and a lizard. And I think that by watching this, it's going to help you to understand how to be successful in any area of your life. I hope you enjoy this presentation and it helps you to figure out exactly what's holding you back from being successful. The title of this first session is called The Secrets of Success because I want you guys to be really, really successful in any area of your life. And that's what I'm going to talk about today, this first session. And we're going to be talking a lot about the brain and how it works because if you have to understand how your brain works, you can literally use it to accomplish anything you want in this life, which is pretty exciting. We start understanding that. Okay. So I'm going to go through a couple of things. The first thing I want to talk about is the first choice that all of you guys have to make if you're going to be successful. The first choice you have to make is a choice called attitude. I want to tell you guys a story that literally changed my entire life. My sophomore year, I couldn't beat the guys, the two-way classes below me. So I cut down to 130 pounds. So what would happen? I would come in on a Monday morning to practice. I get on the scale. I step on the scale and the scale would say I weighed 160 pounds. And then that Thursday I had to weigh 130 pounds or I didn't get a wrestle. So every single week I had to lose 30 pounds. How many of you guys have ever tried to lose weight before? Okay. How many of you tried to lose weight as a wrestler? Okay. It's different. You have bones down, a couple of the wrestlers in the room. So when you lose weight as a wrestler, it's not like losing weight, like cutting calories and that. Like you don't eat or drink while wearing plastic suits to wrestle as hard as you can. You have to suck water out of your body. Okay. A gallon of water weighs eight pounds. So if I lose 30 pounds in four days, that would suck out like three and a half gallons of water from my body if you want to make weight. And so I would do that every single week and every single week. And I remember like doing that the first week is kind of fun. Second week you're tired. My third week, like why am I doing this? I am so tired. I started coming with a bad attitude. I don't want to do it. And like, oh, I have to lose weight again. And like it was just this frustrating thing. And remember after one really, really, really hard practice, and I think I must have a bad attitude. I think half the team did weird. They looked pretty bad. But I remember afterwards our coach took us out into the hallway and it was kind of this back hallway. It was completely dark. There were no lights. It was just like the backside of the gym. And he started like talking to us. He said, you guys, you have to understand something. He's like, we have practice every single day. Right? You've all committed to be at this weight class. Like you have to do it no matter what. Right? He said the only difference is like you're going to go through the experience one way or the other. Every day you're coming to practice, every single day you got to lose weight. Every single thing you're doing is the only thing you can control in this situation is your attitude. That's it. You can come to the practice and be like, this is going to be awesome. Have a good attitude or you can have a crappy attitude. But you have to do the work either way. But your attitude is the only thing that you can actually affect that you can change that you're in charge of. So you got to change your attitude. And for some reason when he said that day, it hit me. I was like, I've got a bad attitude. Because of that I'm dreading practice. I'm dreading cutting weight. I'm dreading all the things. And it was a miserable experience for me. I was like, I'm committed dude. I'm going to be doing it anyway. Like I got to change my attitude. And so that night I went home, remember things like, what does that mean? How do I change my attitude? And so the next day I came to practice and the way it works when you're cutting weight, you put a pair of sweats on, I put my sweats on and then I've had to put a plastic suit on so I put plastic suit over the sweats, then another pair of sweats on top of the plastic suits and then a beanie and a hoodie. So my body is just as hot as possible. I came into practice, I rest in rooms like a thousand degrees and I go in there, I got the jump rope and I start jumping rope and then in my head I said, I got to have a good attitude. So I start smiling. And I had the biggest, cheesiest, most annoying smile you'll ever see. And I'm jumping rope and also the first kid on my team comes in and he's all bad. What are you doing? I'm like, I'm cutting weight dude. I said, why are you smiling? I was like, I don't know. I'm cutting weight, I'm going to have a good attitude. The next guy comes in, dude Brunson stop smiling. I'm like, no I'm smiling. After four or five people came in, they kept asking, why are you smiling, why are you smiling? And also I had this thing pop in my head and I said, I realized something. I told them, I've never once seen somebody lose with a smile on their face. So I'm going to smile as I'm going through this horrible thing. It was an attitude, it was a choice I was able to make. And because of that, I ended up loving wrestling practice. I ended up becoming a really good wrestler. I had tons of success in my life. How many of you guys go to school right now and you're like, oh I got to go to school, my teacher's so stupid. My kids better raise their hand. I hear everyone, I drive you every morning. Me, I was like, oh this is so hard, my teacher's so boring. Or you go to church like, I don't want to go to church today. Or you're like, oh I got to go work out. My mom now want me to do this thing and you go through a horrible attitude. How many of you have done that and then you have a bad time at church or school or doing your workout? Yeah, right? You've got to do it anyway. You've got to go to school. You've got to do the right things, right? So you've got to do these things anyway and you've got two opportunities. You can go in there with the bad attitude and make the whole time or you can go through good attitude. I guess it happens both ways you're doing the experience. We do the good attitude, it changes everything for you. My biggest goal with this, I don't care if you guys learn nothing about marketing, I want you guys to believe in yourselves. When I was growing up, I always thought I was a dumb kid. That was my identity. I literally would go to school and because I struggled in tests, I struggled in school, I couldn't pay attention, teachers yelled me. I remember, I don't know if someone told me but my head, I thought I was dumb. It's because I thought I was dumb, guess what? I did dumb stuff. I didn't do good in school, I struggled every single time and it wasn't until I got into wrestling. I remember, again, my whole life I was like, I'm a dumb kid. I'm not going to test because I'm dumb. I just thought I was dumb. I thought I was dumb. And then I had a coach and this is another wrestling coach. His name is Greg Williams. He's actually the head coach at Utah Valley University right now. And Greg was my head coach. I went out there and the very first time I wrestled for him, he was my freestyle Greco coach. He was off-season wrestling. I went out there and I was stepping on the mat and I started wrestling this guy and this guy starts beating me really good. I'm getting frustrated and then there's kind of a break. We have a period. I come off and Greg said, hey, you're doing a couple of things wrong. He's like, you got to shift this. He told me three or four things to change. So I'm like, okay. So I kept my elbows in, got lower, get in psych, do some basic things. I went back out there and ended up wrestling and ended up beating the kid. And I came off and I remember Greg's looking at me with like a smile on his face. He's like, this is really cool. I'm like, what's really cool? He's like, you are so coachable. He said the word, you're coachable. And I was like, huh, I'm not dumb. I'm coachable. And this coach believed in me. He said, I'm coachable. He's like, well, Greg's a really good coach. If he thinks I'm coachable, I'm coachable. Like I'm going to lean into that. And all of a sudden I was like, I'm coachable. Whatever my coach is, I'm just going to do it. Because that became my new identity, I'm coachable. I started listening. I started paying attention. I started doing anything that my coach said because I was coachable. Okay. And I'm fully aware that some of you guys coming here, you believe that you're dumb. You believe you're not smart. You believe you're lazy. You believe these things because people have told you over and over and over again. And because maybe you've been lazy, right? Or maybe you've been dumb, whatever it is. But I'm here to tell you guys that you are capable of so much more than you even understand right now. All right. If you guys believe it as possible, it's the biggest thing. Since I believed I was coachable, I was coachable. I became somebody different. I became somebody better. Right? When I started business, I didn't know how to do anything in business. I was struggling. I struggled in school. I struggled all these kinds of things. And all of a sudden one day I created something. I was like, wow, I'm kind of creative. I had an idea. I actually did the thing and it changed everything. So then I started believing in myself. Everything shifted. And I believe in you guys. Matt believes in you guys. Your parents believe in you guys. I want you guys to believe in you guys as well. Because you believe in yourself. Literally anything you want to accomplish in life is possible. Choice number three. And this is the biggest one. This is the one where most people get stuck. Every single day you guys are going to have choices in your life. And the choice is one or two things. The choice is are you going to move forward with faith or move forward with fear. I'm going to talk a little bit about Napoleon Hill today. Napoleon Hill is my favorite author. He passed away before I was born. But he wrote some amazing books. One of them is called Think and Grow Rich. Have you guys heard of Think and Grow Rich? Good. He wrote another one called Outwitting the Devil, which is probably my favorite book right now. But in Outwitting the Devil book he said that if you look at society, look at people. He says they always make one or two choices. They're moving towards faith or towards fear. Every decision we have, he says right now 98% of the world makes their choices moving towards fear. And he says when they do that they become drifters. Who here knows what a drifter is? Okay? A drifter is someone who drifts through life. They got no goals. They have nothing to move towards. Right? Someone who's a drifter, someone who's sitting here and watches Netflix all day. Right? They're drifting. They're just sitting there day in and day out. 98% of the world are drifters. Do you understand that? Society wants people to be drifters. They don't not want you to have goals to be driven. And then 2% of the world are driven. Okay? I want you guys to become driven. Even if everything in your life so far has been what I've been drifting like, oh I do the easy thing. I lay back. I don't work so hard. I want you guys to be driven. Okay? The ones aren't that difficult because only 2% of people in this world are actually trying. People are like, how do you have success in wrestling? Wrestling is like most of the other people I compete against were drifters. They weren't working out like I was working out. They didn't want it the way I wanted it. Right? I was one of the 2%. I was one of the driven who went after my goals. Okay? And I'm going to talk about why these monkeys and lizards are here in a few minutes. But only 2% are driven. Okay? And the difference between someone who's a drifter and someone who's driven is moving forward in faith or moving forward in fear. How many guys are going to get things that come to you like choices? You get really, really nervous. You get fear. Okay? It's normal. We're going to talk about why that happens here. I'm going to talk about your brain and why those things happen. And fear is a big thing. It keeps most of us back. Okay? We hear about faith. Faith is saying, I'm nervous. I'm scared anyway. I know this is right. Therefore, I'm going to do it. I'm going to take that step. That's the difference between the driven and the drifters. Okay? And so if you decide, man, instead of being fearful and not doing this thing, if I'm decided to move forward in faith and take steps forward and you become someone who's driven, that's what you're going to have success in life. What I understand is the only thing keeping you guys from where you are today to where you want to be is your brain. My goal is for you guys to think about your brain because most things you're doing in your life are happening subconsciously and you don't even know they're happening. Okay? They're happening. Sometimes it's really positive. Sometimes it's really negative. These things are happening over and over and over again. So my goal is to help you understand what's happening and why it's happening. When you understand it and you can see it, then you can change it. And that's really the big, powerful thing. Okay? So this is the diagram I want to show you guys right here. This is your brain. Now there's a lot of pieces of your brain. I'm going to talk about three parts of the brain, the three that in my mind are the most important for you guys to understand and be successful in any area of life. You're going to be successful in sports, if it's music, if it's a hobby, it's art, it's whatever it's business. Like if you understand these three pieces of the mind, this is the key to understanding things. Okay? So the first is your conscious mind. This is an oversimplification. There's going to be some brain science. It's like, well Russell, technically, no. This is the simplification. This is how I understand it and it's changed my life understanding this. Okay? The front is your conscious mind. Okay? In the middle is going to be your subconscious mind. Okay? And the back is going to be your instinctive mind. Okay? So I'm going to help you guys to understand this and master. So I bought some friends along with me on this trip to help you guys to understand this. Some of you guys saw us carrying these things around when we were checking the hotel today, or yesterday. Okay? So these are my friends. This is my friend, the elephant. What if I get him to hang out here? There's the elephant. This is my friend, the lizard. Put him right here. And these are my friends, the monkeys. Okay? We've got two monkeys here. Which one of these monkeys looks more emotional? Like he's got emotional problems. Is this the emotional monkey? Is this the emotional monkey? This is emotional, okay? That's what I thought too. So which monkeys is more logical? Like things make more logical, like the logical monkey. Is this the logical? Okay, so inside of your mind, the conscious mind, there are these two monkeys that are in charge, okay? Buddha said that the conscious mind is like a monkey. Okay? And what do monkeys do? They swing and they change and they talk and they chatter and you do all sorts of crazy stuff, right? How many of you guys ever feel like that in your brain when you're talking to yourself and you're like, you're doing this and this and this and it's bouncing around and you're like, I'm all over the place. How many of you guys have ever felt that before? If you haven't, you're lying. I know how our brains work, right? So we have these conscious brains that are crazy and they're moving around. In fact, I'm going to come down here with you guys. Can I come down? Can I just go down? Okay. I'm going to grab. Okay, I need to find somebody who is like the most emotional person here. You're emotional? Okay, you're going to be the emotional monkey. Is your mom emotional or is she more logical? Okay, you're going to hold the logical monkey. Okay. So we've got these two different monkeys. Actually, you just want to stand up so you can, everyone can see the monkeys. I want to talk about what these things are. Okay. So if you look at the picture, I appear real quick. So the monkeys are our conscious mind, right? And we have these two monkeys that are, that we're always sitting here and have this conversation with. Okay. All day long, you guys have conversations with yourself and there's these two voices talking back and forth. Okay. There's an emotional one right here. It's very emotional and there's a logical monkey. We both have these. Now, typically as kids, we have our emotional ones a lot louder. As adults, usually our logical ones a lot louder. In fact, check this out. I want to show you guys something cool. When you see Twinkies or brownies, what do you think? I would do Twinkies. You Twinkies, right? Do you want to hit Twinkie? Yeah. Is that a Twinkie or a brownie? I would do Twinkies. You Twinkies. Why? What do you like about Twinkies? Because, um, they're good, right? Yeah, they're good. Yeah, they're so good. I love the frosting inside. They're so soft. All right. So yeah, I got a question for you. When you see these, what are your thoughts? Um, preservatives. Preserves. What else are you thinking about? Stay away. Yeah, stay away. Stay away. Stay away. Stay away. Stay away. Stay away. You think about the calories? Yeah. 280 calories per Twinkie? That's insane. If I eat three of these, I'm done for the week, right? Okay. So this is emotion versus logic. It happens every single day in our brains, right? We see the Twinkies and also our emotional monkeys going like, oh my gosh, I want a Twinkie. That's so good. And a logical brain is like, wait, hold on. There's preservatives. There's calories. Like, oh my gosh, the sugar water, like, and then it starts freaking out. But then your emotional brain is like, but it looks so good. Like we need that. So our emotional monkey starts going back and forth and we have this battle on our head. Back, forth, back, forth, back, forth. Let me just have a look at that battle before. Every day, yes. Okay, these are the two monkeys that are there. Okay. And this is our conscious mind every single day that are having this battle back and forth. Now what's interesting about the conscious mind, the way it works, it asks questions. Okay. So it says, oh, should I eat that? Oh, that looks really good. Oh, how many calories does that have though? Oh, but if I eat that, I can work out later or but and then it starts asking these questions back and forth. And that's how our conscious brain works, the two monkeys in the front. Okay. So there's emotion versus logic. Or I understand we have this constant debate between emotional logic, emotional logic that's happening every single day. Okay. When you guys come here, you're going to do it for a business or you want to lose weight or you want to do it and like whatever you're doing, you have an idea. Your conscious mind sees that thing. It's like, I want to do the thing and you get excited and emotionally like this is amazing. And then also your logic brain is like, oh, but what if I fail? What if I do this? What all of a sudden it goes back and forth and back and forth. Okay. We had this debate happening right all the time between motion and logic. Okay. That's the first thing we understand. That's your conscious mind. So from touch to head and say your conscious mind that's happening in the front here. Okay. This is what this is the part of your brain you're actually familiar with. You hang out with the thing every single day. Sometimes you love it, sometimes you hate it, but it's there all the time constantly going back and forth, back and forth. Okay. So that's the, that's the conscious mind, the monkeys. Okay. Now what's interesting is the conscious mind only has five ways to get information and get data. Okay. The kids probably know this. You guys know what the five senses are. Okay. What are the five senses? Name out one of them. Touch, taste, sight, sound, smell. Okay. So these are the five senses. So your, but your conscious mind, those two monkeys can get information through those five different sources. Okay. And it's pretty powerful. That's all, that's the only thing they have at their, their disposal is those five senses. Okay. So if you want to go and do something, right, you want to be something great, you got to think about it with your brain. These monkeys are going back and forth and you're like, okay, I got to find out how to do this. I want to be good at business. I got to think, okay, where am I going to find the answers? Okay. Can I see it? If I see it, I got to read a book or I'm going to read to find it or I'm going to hear it. I'm going to listen to a book or I'm going to taste it. I'm going to smell it. But our five senses are what is giving these two emotional monkeys all the information they need. Okay. Now, your conscious brain also gives you the ability to start thinking about what you want to do. Okay. How many of you have ever asked yourself this question, what do you want to be when you grow up? Okay. I'm glad that the adults say yes too. I literally have this conversation myself probably every 60 days like, what do I want to be when I grow up? Like for a long time I wanted to be a wrestler. So I was like, I want to be a wrestler. Okay. If I'm going to be a wrestler, what am I going to do? I start thinking, start figuring out how to do that, right? Consciously going after a thing. After I got into wrestling, I was like, well, I want to start a business. And so I started thinking about that. I was wondering, what am I going to grow up? And then I'm like, oh, I want to write a book. Oh, I want to do an event. Oh, I want to start thinking about things, right? But this is something you should all be asking yourself every single day. Even if you're a kid, if you're old, it doesn't matter. Like, what do you want to be when you grow up? Okay. My kids told me one time, I'm the least mature adult they've ever met. So I'm still working on it. I still know what I want to be when I grow up. But it keeps changing. But the first question you got to think is like, what do you want to be like? What is that thing you actually want to do? Who here knows what you want to do? Not that many. And me, I was like, I'm not really sure I'm here trying to figure that out. I don't really know what I want to do. Can you think about this? This is Napoleon Hill. Again, he's my favorite author and he wrote a book called, Think and Grow Rich. And in this book, he talks about the concept of you can think and actually grow rich. How many of us like to just think and then grow rich? Good. It's not that hard if you start learning how to think. So we're talking more about that. But one thing he said, he said, there's a quality which one must possess to win. And that's the definiteness of purpose and the knowledge that what one wants and a burning desire possess it. Okay. So for all of us, if we want to be successful in life, the first thing we have to know is number one, what? Let's say first we have to know a knowledge of what we actually want. If somebody asks like, what do you actually want? Like what are you here? What do you want to do? Some people ask like, I don't know. I just hear. I go to school. I do something. You have to know what you actually want. Right? Otherwise you're just kind of drifting around. Oh, there's a word drifter. You're just drifting and drifting. Okay. If you want to be driven, you have to be driven towards something. I have to have a goal. I have a direction. I'm going. Right? Okay. So the first thing is like, what do you actually want? And after you know what you actually want, the second thing is then you have to have desire to actually want it. Okay. I've had times in my life where I think, I want to lose weight. That's what I want to do. I didn't have any desire to do it. So I guess what didn't happen. I didn't lose weight. Right? I got into this like, I got into drifting. I just hung back. I didn't do it. It wasn't until a year and a half ago, I was like, I am tired of feeling tired all the time. I need to get in shape. I need to figure things out. And I figured out this is what I want to do. What I'm going to do it. This is the time. And I had a desire enough that actually went and made the change in my life to go and have success. Okay. Business, same thing. Rest, same thing. Everything is doing the same thing. So you guys, this question, what do you guys think about? So what is it you actually want? And not just like, oh, that'd be nice. Oh yeah. That's cool. And like, no, you actually desire. But I want that thing so bad. I need to have it. Okay. So that's what you guys think about. In fact, we're going to do a little assignment right now. What is your definite purpose? What is your goal? What is the thing that you actually want in life? Okay. And it could be I want to start a business. It might be something else. It doesn't matter to me. So my question for you, I want you guys to think for a minute. Like, what do you actually want? Okay. And I want you guys to dream a little bit. Maybe like, I don't know if I'm ready for that. I don't know if I'm capable of that. I understand that. Like I get nervous too. But what is it you actually want? I want you to think about that. I want you to have your ride down. So I'm going to give you guys three minutes to put some music on and think about in your life. And this is not what your parents want. That's what somebody else is like. What do you actually want? Because we can go and get it. Whatever that thing is you want to get, we can get it. But you have to know what it actually is. So after we know what we want, then the second question is why do you actually want it? What's your motive? Have you ever watched TV and they have like murder mysteries where someone dies and they find a suspect. Like, what's the motive? Why did they do this? We need to know why they did it. So for us, we know like this is what we want. But the second question we had to ask is, well, why do we want it? So this is the key, you guys. If you don't know what you want, you can't get it. I promise you that. It isn't possible. That's called drifting. Like, I don't know what I want. I'm going to watch Netflix. I don't know what I want. I'm going to go eat some food. I don't know what I want. Like that's the way 98% of the world is functioning right now. Do you understand that? By you deciding this is what I actually want, guess what? You're ahead of 98% of the people in the world. And the good news is they can change. Right? I wanted to be an Olympic wrestler for a while and I didn't reach that goal and I changed it. It's fine. You can change your goal. It doesn't have to be the same thing. Driven, not drifting. Okay? If you have something you're moving towards, that's how you can change your life. You can change other people's lives. It all comes off of a direction. Now we're moving down to the next step. So we've got these two monkeys. Now these monkeys think that they're in charge. They're, they're, they're, they assume they're the ones in charge. Right? So for all the guys in your conscious mind, you're doing these things. You're like, oh, my mind's in charge. I know I'm doing and you think you're in charge, but guess what? I'm going to ruin it for you. You are not actually in charge. I want you guys to imagine really quick, these two monkeys, this is your conscious mind sitting on top of this huge elephant and these two monkeys are riding the elephant. Okay? So here's our elephant. Look at this guy. So here's the elephant and the elephant wants to go somewhere. So he's walking down, kind of borrow one of the monkeys. I'll give it back. I promise. Okay. So the monkey's here and this monkey is riding this elephant. Okay? He's riding the elephant along and what happens is the monkey's like, oh my gosh, I want to do and it said I want something. I want to lose weight. I want to make money. I want to win a two comic club award and he gets all excited because it's emotional. Right? It's like, ah, I'm going to win an award. This is going to be so awesome. Right? Signs up, buys a coaching program, whatever gets all excited. It's like, over there, I'm going to go over this and we're going to win an award and the monkey's looking over here. I'm going to go this way and go this way. But then the elephant's like, doodadoo and it starts walking in another direction. Monkey's like, no, go over here, over here, over here. The elephant's like, I don't go over that way. This is the way I go. Okay? This right here is your subconscious mind and this thing is actually what's in charge. As much as the monkey thinks he's in charge, he's not. The monkey cannot steer the elephant. He can't shift it and move it. The elephant lifts his leg a little bit. Looks like a brain, right? Like, there, boom. Did you see that? So there it is. There's the elephant lifts his leg up. Boom, it's a brain. This is your subconscious mind. Okay? Now, if you look right here, first talked about the conscious mind, the monkey's in the front and then the subconscious mind is the middle thing right here. Okay? And I want you to understand how the subconscious mind works. Okay? Subconscious mind works through patterns. Okay? So if you think about this, when you were a little kid, some of you guys are little kids now, but I think all of you guys mastered this. How many of you guys remember when you were a little kid and it was the very first time your parents gave you pants? And they gave you pants like you put your pants on and you're like, okay, how do I do it? And the emotional monkey's like, I want some pants. This is amazing. And then the logical one's like, well, what goes on first? I put the left leg in, the right leg in, like, I don't know. You start thinking through it and then the monkey's like, okay, put the right foot left foot and you do it once. Okay. Now I know how to put my pants. Next day you wake up, right? And you're like, okay, I'm going to put pants on again. How do I do it? And you're like, okay, well, yesterday I put right leg left leg, left leg and you're constantly thinking and you do another day and another day and eventually you do it again and again and again. How many guys remember putting your pants on today? Okay? Like two people. Scott remembers nobody else. Okay? Okay? How many of you guys know that if you would go watch it, you put, when you put your pants on every single day, you put the exact same leg in the first time every single time. Okay? The reason why is because these monkeys consciously decided I want to put on pants that it's so many times over and over and over again. What it is, it created a pattern inside your subconscious mind. Your subconscious mind is like, cool, I got this pants on and it plays a program and just goes and does the thing. Okay? So our subconscious mind creates these patterns and the patterns look kind of like this. You have a tractor, right? And a tractor goes out and they start, it starts like plowing the field, right? It does it over and over and over again. And the right hand side here, what are those things? Who knows what those are called? Ruts, right? And the ruts get deeper and deeper and deeper. And after you do it five, 10, 20, 30 times, eventually the ruts get so deep that the dude who's driving the tractor could let Garrett go to the wheel and it would just drive because the wheels are stuck in the ruts, right? It gets you exactly where you need to go. Okay? Same thing is true for us inside of our minds is that there's these ruts that we get into that just, they snap back to them and we go back into these ruts. Now sometimes these ruts are really positive and sometimes they're really negative. Okay? And so what we've got to figure out is like, what are the ruts? In fact, if you look at this, call this ruts or we call them habits as well. Okay? There's two ways that habits are developed. Number one is they're environmental. That's the spell environmental. So that means it's like, we didn't plan on it, it just happens, right? There's a whole bunch of things you guys do in your life right now that just happen. Sometimes they're positive, sometimes they're negative, but they're just happening because you've been doing them for so long in your life. How many of you guys have something in your life that drives you crazy? Like, God, why do I keep doing that? I don't want to do that. I keep screwing up the same way. I keep doing the same mistake. I keep doing it over and over again. You're like, why do I keep making the same mistake? It's because somewhere you have this pattern, right? And I draw this, Napoleon Hill calls it hypnotic rhythm. So it's like this pattern, like these ruts that you get into and it's hard to get out of them once you get into them, right? The second way you create habits, the second way is you actually create them, right? You figure out what they actually want. So an example of this is in sports. How many of you guys are athletes in this room and done sports? Okay. So only sport I'm really good at is wrestling, so I'll use another wrestling analogy. But when I started wrestling, my coaches would go and they would teach me to move, right? And they would consciously teach my two monkeys, right? Okay, Russell, here's the move you're going to do. And they would teach me to move and my monkeys would be like, okay, how's it work? And I figured it out. It's in my conscious mind. And then we would practice it. Okay. So you go to practice, you drill things, right? You drill over and over and over and over and over again. Every day you go to practice, it's like same thing, getting our stance. It's like control. We shoot the same leg. We get lower. Like we practice the same thing over and over and over again. And we do it as many times as we can until it becomes a pattern. Okay. In fact, there's a, this is one of Malcolm Gladwell's books. We talk about the 10,000 hour rule, right? Like to become amazing at something, you got to do it 10,000 hours. I've done 10,000 hours, it becomes so deep inside your mind, the year is perfect at it. Okay. So when wrestling, what would happen is we would practice to move over and over and over and over again. And then we get into wrestling, now we start wrestling. And also, if someone shoots on you, I don't have to think like, what am I going to do? Right? This pattern is my subconscious mind and in my pattern, it knows like, okay, move your leg or snap them down or you're going to do this kind of thing. And it becomes part of who you are. Okay. So our job is to train our subconscious mind, to train, to create the patterns, to create the correct patterns, to get in the ruts, to actually help us as opposed to the ones that hurt us. Does that make sense? Okay. So that's what our mind is, we got to create these patterns and create these routines over and over and over again. Now a couple of things that are interesting. How many of you have ever heard the saying that practice makes perfect? How many of you guys believe that? Okay. You got to be careful. So I see this all the time with my wrestlers, well, we'll have a practice and we'll teach them a new move. Like this is the move, now let's drill it and we drill over and over and over again. And the kids will drill it wrong over and over. They drill it close, but they do, they're in bad position. They do this wrong thing. They drill it 10, 20, 30, 50 times incorrectly. After they're all these times wrong, they're going to match and they try to do it and they do it, they do the move, but they do it incorrectly and it doesn't actually work. Okay. So practice doesn't make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect. Okay. So you have to figure out like what is the thing you want and then practice it over and over and over and over again. Because this, if you understand this principle, it literally can change life forever. And I'm going to show you guys one other secret that is the coolest thing pretty much of all time. Are you guys okay with that? I don't have to share the last secret. I can keep it to myself. Okay. So again, this is how the brain works, right? We have these, we have emotional logic out here and we have our five senses. So we have our five senses that are gathering data for us and doing things. So we'll go out there, figuring out what do we want? We're studying, we're learning, we're reading, we're figuring things out in our head. And then we have, from that we have to go and start creating patterns. So then we practice over and over and over again. We start creating these, again, Napoleon Hill called hypnotic rhythm, but these patterns inside of our mind, they're going to get us to what our goal is. Okay. We practice over and over and over and over again. Now a couple of things I want you guys to understand, like when you compete in sports, if you compete and you're competing with your conscious mind, this is where you lose. Have you ever heard of an athlete who's like, when they're playing like, we're in the zone, I'm in the zone, right? You have so much success. When you're hitting the zone is when you're not consciously thinking about it, when it's all happening subconsciously. Okay. Now I had a chance last month to wrestle at a tournament and it was really, really cool. And my son, Bowen came with me and this is actually a negative story that's teaching positive principles. This is why I went through it. So I go out there, I'm wrestling this guy and first period, I go out there, I'm excited. I've been practicing, I've been training, like everything subconsciously is figured out. I walk out there to wrestle, I shake his hand, I start going. I'm wrestling, I'm wrestling, I'm beating him. You remember it was like nine to two in freestyle 10 points is tech falls. It was nine to two, about to beat the guy. And all of a sudden some flurry happens, like it hit in the face, boom, and my eye splits open, blood's pouring down my face. All over the mat, it was amazing. Right? And I was like, this is awesome. I'm gonna clean it up and then they can't get my blood, things to stop bleeding. It took like five or six minutes. They ended up like wrapping tape around my entire head to get my eye to stop bleeding and everything. And I went out there after I got wrestling and we shook hands again and guess what happened in that little five minutes thing. My mind went from being subconscious all of a sudden conscious, like, okay, I gotta win. What am I gonna do? I start thinking through all the things I needed to do to actually wrestle him. And then what happened, Bowen? I lost because I was thinking, I was thinking. When times of competition happen, you can't be thinking. Right? How many of you guys watched Top Gun the movie? Did you notice the Top Gun like 500 times? Like stop thinking, stop thinking, rely on what you know. Right? Because you practice. If you put in the time over and over and over again, you step out there, you have to stop thinking and let your subconscious mind take over. Because your subconscious mind is powerful. It's the thing that will make you win in sports, in business, in anything. If you're consciously doing it, you're gonna struggle. Okay? So practice, you can consciously say, okay, I'm gonna practice, I'm gonna learn this, I'm gonna do it. Practice over and over and over and over again. Perfect practice makes perfect. It becomes a pattern. After it's a pattern, then you have that thing. Right? The reason I'm able to come out on stage and start talking, I don't have to consciously think about this stuff. Like, I have some slides on the outline, but I just start talking because I've been talking to this so many times, like so many years, like, these things start appearing and showing up when I need them. Okay? So the same thing is true for you guys. These things, you have five senses come in here, but this is where you win. This is where you become the best in the world, whatever it is you want to be. It's by training your subconscious mind and making these things patterns. Okay? Now here's the real cool secret. This is like one of the most amazing things. I told you guys before that the monkeys have these five senses, right? Now what's cool about this is you can go with these five senses, you can figure out most things, right? With sight, I can read things, I can read books, I can read stuff, I can learn a lot. With sound, I can hear things, listen to audio books, I can learn a lot. Taste, smell, touch, like with these cool things. But sometimes I can't find the answer with my five senses, right? And as you guys get older, you're gonna have to learn this more and more and more. And so what's amazing is your subconscious mind has this thing. And I'm gonna do dotted line and it's called the sixth sense. Have you guys seen the movie, the sixth sense? This is not what I'm talking about. This is not what you talk to dead people. This is not the sixth sense. So Napoleon Hill calls the sixth sense tapping into, what's he called? Unlimited conscious, or the infinite mind, infinite intelligence. Infinite intelligence. So sixth sense is literally God. There are times when you cannot with your five senses find the answer to something and the only way to get the answers is through your sixth sense. How do we tap into the sixth sense? There's different ways. Some people do it through meditation, some people do it through praying. But if you want to find answers, you can't physically find it through your senses. The only way to get that is externally. And one of the most powerful things you guys, if you can learn this is so cool. When you're stuck on a problem, you're stuck on something, you can't figure it out. If you will say a prayer, you will meditate, you'll start thinking about it and then forget about it and step away for a minute. That's when the sixth sense can speak to your subconscious mind and give you ideas. How many of you guys have ever been stuck on a problem? You can't figure it out, you can't figure it out. And then you get in the shower, you're showering and also you're like, oh my gosh, I figured it out. How many of you guys have ever felt that before? Okay, this is the reason. Before you're sitting here with your conscious mind trying to figure it out, trying to figure it out and it's not available. It's not, like your five senses cannot find the answer. So we're trying, we're trying, we're trying, we can't find the answer. And so we break away, we get in the shower and these monkeys, we like stop talking. And you like go out of your mind and all of a sudden, boom, God, sixth sense, whatever you want to call it, this gives you the intuition we call it sometimes, like gives you the idea. And so this is the key to understand that. It's one of those powerful things you do before you go to bed at night, ask questions. Like what are the questions? What are the things you're stuck on you can't find the answers to? And nine times out of ten you wake up in the morning and the idea will show up. It talks down in the scripture, it says, knocking you shall receive, asking you shall begin on to you. It's not talking about like ask for a car and God's going to give you a car. It's saying ask questions and we'll give it to you through your sixth sense, through your mind. Right? That's what these ideas will come to you. Let's keep starting understanding that. Okay? All right. So we talked about two parts of the brain. We talked about the conscious mind, the subconscious mind. No one talked about this was the one. This is the one that messes most of us up. This is the one that makes so many people become drifters. And it's back here in the back, about this area right here. Let me ask you all a touch back here. Okay. It's called your instinctive mind. They call it the limbic system. This is the instinctive mind. The instinctive mind right here is where fear comes from. Okay? And that's why I have my little friend, the lizard, to show us. Now what's interesting about this, this part of our brain, it was actually developed to help us with a lot of things, right? Like when you were born, you know you're born with two fears. Okay? You're born with two fears. So this is your, this is your body. And inside your body, you're born with two fears. Who knows what the two fears are you have when you're born? One of them is falling. And even when you're a brand new baby, the fear of falling. What's the other one? Loud noises. Loud noises. Loud noises, okay? So when you're born, those are the only two fears you have. That's it. Okay? And this, those fears are here inside this lizard back here. And they're back there, like something, something like you start falling like, be scared. You're like, oh, I'm scared. We're here loud. I was like, God, be scared, be scared. But then what happens is like, you're, you're six months old, a year old, and then your mom sees a spider and she starts freaking out screaming, ah! And also your brain's like, I'm scared of spiders. I'm scared of spiders. And she starts calling us and adds this next thing, like, oh, we are also scared of spiders. And then like, something else happens, right? Oh, I'm scared of, I'm scared of a bear coming and eating me. Oh, I'm scared of, we start adding these fears. But we start with just two. Okay. Now these fears are actually for the most part good for us because they're keeping us alive. Right? Okay, now there's two parts of this. The other side, we have our body that this, this lizard trying to protect us. We don't die. We have this other thing inside of us called our ego. Ego. Okay? And this lizard also is there to protect your ego. It does not want you to feel bad. Now what's crazy about this lizard, this lizard is evil. Okay? This lizard speaks in absolutes. You know what that means? He has never star wars, Darth Vader's fighting at the end and he goes, only sys deal in absolutes. Okay? Absolute is an absolute thing. So how many of you guys have ever been trying to do something and in the back of your head like, you're not smart enough? Absolute. You're dumb. You're gonna be embarrassed. Don't do it. This is gonna be hard for you. This is gonna be scary. Right? This is this lizard back here. Not only is it trying to protect your body from dying, it's trying to protect your ego from dying. So he's gonna keep talking to you and talking to you and pecking at you. And he tells you things about yourself. Not because he cares about you. Okay? This thing is amazing. It doesn't tell you what happened, it tells you how to feel about what happened. Okay? It's back there in your mind and all of us have this thing. Okay? And this thing causes more people to slip into drifting and fear and scared than anything else. Right? So we walked on the stage. I was backstage with my wife, my kids, we're back there and you hear noises and there was cheering and Brent's back there and my kids are like, I don't know about there. I'm like, I don't either. Like, I'm scared too. Like, I still to this day get so scared every single time. Like, my head's like, Russell, you're not ready. You're not worthy. It's not okay. What if they don't like you? What if you talk too fast? What if they can't understand you? What if, what if, what if, what if, okay? This thing mocks me as much as it mocks all of us. We all have this. Okay? But we have to understand this is the thing that's there to protect us, our body. It's good to help us run from bears and from spiders, right? But we have to be able to turn it off when it's talking about our ego. Okay? Our ego is the thing it's trying to protect. So let me come over here. I have too many things in my pockets. Okay? So our body, and we had falling and loud noises and eventually started adding spiders and things like that. And our ego, Tony Robbins says the two things that all humans fear. Number one is that we're not enough. Number two, if we're not enough, we're not going to feel loved. Okay? And so that's the thing that this thing right here is yelling at us and talking about us over and over and over again. Okay? And it's protecting, the ego is protecting our status. Do you want to be my lizard friend? Okay? He's kind of mean, but contain him. That's the goal. Okay? You contain him. All right. So these are the three parts of the brain. You just have to understand they're happening every single day. When you start understanding how they work and how they work together, it becomes really, really powerful. Fear speaks in absolutes. And fear's number one goal is to pull you from driving. It does not want you to be driven. It's scared to death. What if I try this thing and I fail? What if I try this thing and I mess up? What if I try this thing and I get embarrassed? What if I try it? So it's trying to pull you away from being driven and make you become a drifter. Okay? And it's very, very, very efficient. This thing is 98% of people in the world are drifters. Right? So we have to understand that. So we talked about earlier, talking about there's faith in the fear, right? Here's the picture. We're here on the elephant and we've got a choice every single day. Faith or fear. Faith or fear. Okay? And the lizard's like, don't do it. You're going to fail. It's going to be hard. You've tried three diets this year. Don't try another one. You're going to fail again. Because you've done three funnels. Russell said one funnel away. You've done three. Don't even try it. Like why would you try it? It's so embarrassing. You look like an idiot. Right? Like don't go step on the resting mat. Like you're wearing a singlet. It's embarrassing. You lost last time. You lost this guy. Like all the fears. Like this thing is trying to protect your ego over and over and over again. But by protecting your ego, it's destroying your life. You have to understand that. So we have to learn how do we turn this thing off? Because I do not want to move forward in fear. Nothing good comes to you, to your family, to your life, to your legacy, to anything if you're moving forward in fear. And that's what this lizard wants to do. It wants you to be in fear. So you have to come back and say, okay, stop. Stop talking to me. I need to move forward in faith. The monkeys on the front, they are faith. They want you to move forward. They set a goal. I want to win a two comic club award. But you're done. But I see them on stage. I want to win one. Yeah, you're not smart enough though. But like all these people, I see kids winning, other people winning it. Yeah, but you're just not that good looking. You're not good on camera. You're going to be, you're going to be, you talk too slow. You talk too fast. Like a million things. It's going to try everything you can to keep you from being successful because it wants to protect your ego. Okay. So these are three voices in your head, you guys, and they're happening every single day. Right. And so you have to become conscious of that. Right. How many guys are sitting there and you're having these conversations in your head and you're so nervous, you hear all sorts of things. You're like, where is this coming from? Okay. This is how you know. The monkeys right here, they always ask questions. Okay. Should I do that? Should I not do that? What does that look like? Okay. If it's a question that you're hearing in your head, it's the monkeys. They don't want to try and figure things out. They're searching through things. They're reading books. They're studying. They're here right now. Pay attention to everything I'm saying, listening stuff. Okay. The elephant is hearing through the sixth sense. Right. The sixth sense is quiet. It's not loud. It's not yelling at you. The sixth sense is like, Hey, you should go help that person. Hey, here's an idea. Hey, here's something really cool you could do. Right. It's quiet. You just talk to once or twice and that's it. And then the back here, that voice is absolutes. It's bad. It's trying to protect your ego. It's telling you why you're not enough. Why you're not okay. Why if you screw up and you're not going to be loved. It's trying to protect you in a way that's messing you up. Okay. It does not want you to be successful. It just wants you to be safe. Right. If you're safe all the time, you can't stretch. You can't grow. You can't change. Okay. So if you look at like the goal of this whole thing with your brain, this is the goal. Number one, you have to calm this lizard down. You have to learn how to say, No, I'm not listening to you. I am good enough. I am smart enough. I am tall enough. I am short enough. Like whatever it is, right. You have to call the lizard. Number two, you have to learn how to guide the elephant. And number three, that'll get the monkeys where they want to go. That's the goal with our brain. If we can figure those things out. Okay. The monkey say, I want this goal. I'm going to go accomplish. I'm going to make money. I'm going to lose weight. I'm going to be an engineer. I'm going to figure out what you actually want to do. You start pursuing it. Right. Then you got to start learning these things and create patterns to make it so it becomes easier. You practice and you practice and you practice and you practice. 10,000 hours of practice. So this thing has got such a good pattern. You can snap anytime you want. Right. And it's silence this lizard. Because every level doesn't matter where you at. It's going to be talking to you and talking to you down. Why you're not good enough. Why you're not smart enough. Why you're not strong enough. Okay. And then you can start being successful. Okay. Because now you have control of your mind and your brain and how things work. Now the next thing I want to talk about, when you guys all understand, they're all superheroes. Okay. One of the things that you are going to learn when you start down any path, this lizard in the back of your head is going to keep telling you why you're not good enough. Why you have these different problems. I want you guys to all understand you're superheroes. How many of you guys have ever seen, I don't know, any of the Marvel movies? That's it. Who here has ever seen a Marvel movie? Okay. So in the Marvel movie, it's really interesting because you're going to see my mad drawing skills here in a second. Every superhero has got a different power. Right? So you've got, here's the Incredible Hulk. He should be green. Right? So what's Hulk good at? Yeah. Okay. What's Hulk good at? There's one thing, all you can do is smash things. Right? So there's Hulk, he can smash. Then you got Iron Man. Here's Iron Man right here. Iron Man has no actual superpowers. Right? What's he good at? He's a brain. He's very, very smart. Right? He can create a bunch of gadgets. Then you got Captain America. What's he good at? Everyone's like, I don't know. He's really, really being handsome. Something's being... Then you got Hawkeye. You got all the superheroes. Right? And independently, none of them are super great. But guess what happened? The aliens attack New York City and they all band together and they become the what? The Avengers and now they have success. Okay? This is what we have to understand. Most of you guys have a superpower. Okay? But independently, like, well, I'm Hulk. I can smash stuff. And you're like, that's not that cool. All you do is smash stuff all day long. But if you do it and you work with people together, like, everyone needs someone to smash and this and that. Like I am talented at two things. Maybe three max. That's it. Right? But I got some amazing people on my team. Right? John and I, John runs all over. Add something to that. Me and John are very different personalities. Very different things. My skills are way different than his. Right? If you look at me, I look broken in some things. I look great in some things. Same thing to him. But together, we're able to grow companies. Right? We got Kevin. I had to create my own Avengers team. And the biggest thing to understand when you're going in this is understanding, like, I'm not going to be able to do everything. Okay? None of you guys are good enough to do everything. But if you're going to one thing and one thing only, it's all you have to really be good at. Okay? And so before you guys all came, I asked you to take some of the personality tests. How many guys actually took some of the personality tests? Good job. I've got my kids to take them, which I'm really excited for. So the personality tests, I love them because they help me to see what my superpowers actually are. So I'm going to spend like five minutes on going through those things. I want you to understand what your superpowers are. But then also understand that the goal to be successful at anything, you have to have different superpowers. Like, when I wanted to be a state champion, a wrestler, a national champ, like, I wasn't able to just go do it by myself. I had to get someone who was a good coach. I get someone who's a good nutrition. People that are good at different parts, you'll make a team that we could go and have success with. Right? So my goal is to help you understand who you are. And then as you're networking and meeting other people, you can find out, you can understand who they are as well. And you can start finding partnerships and things. Okay? So the first one I want to go through is called the 16 personality test. It's actually called Myers-Briggs back in the day, but then 16 personalities did a better job marketing it. And they made a really cool system. How many of you guys took Myers-Briggs? Okay, if you haven't, open it up. I want you to be able to see, you should have some letters like, you're at ENFJ or TSC, whatever those things are, right? You can have some letters. So I want you to look at your letters and I'm going to go through all these letters mean and then that's where you're going to understand what your superpowers actually are. Okay? All right. So you all have them out in front of you? My kids got them on their phones. Okay. So the first letter here either in the 16 personality, either you're an E or you're an I, introvert or extrovert. Okay? How many of you guys who took the test are extroverts? You have an E? How many of you guys took that are introverts with an I? Okay. Now, I used to think that I was socially inept. Okay? Cause I'm very, very introverted. Some of you guys saw last night at the meet and greet as I'm awkwardly standing there like, this is so hard for me to see people and talk to them and they see them on stage. It doesn't make any sense. I'm not so comfortable here and awkward one-on-one. Okay? Cause I'm very introverted. And there's nothing wrong. Introverts are talented. Extroverts are talented. There's nothing wrong either way. I always thought I was wrong. I thought I was broken. I'm like, man, I can't even talk to people like there's something wrong with me. And it wasn't until I realized like, I'm not broken. I'm just different. I'm just like, oh, that's actually really cool. One thing powerful introverts, introverts are really good at disconnecting, creating things that are showing them people. If you look at most successful like people who like actors and people who write plays of them are very introverted. They create privately and then they display things publicly. Okay? So that became a superpower for me. Extroverts are usually really good at salespeople, really good at one-on-one, really good at conversations and building things. So both of them are good. They're just different. So understanding I was like, oh, I'm not broken. I'm just different. It was really powerful. Okay? A couple of things to know if you're an introvert, a couple of things to know is that typically if you're in a big room like this for a day or so, you're going to be really, really tired. Introverts charged privately. Right? So like you go back home by yourself and like that's how you have to recharge. Extroverts recharge amongst people. Okay? So how many of you know Robbie Summers? You guys all hear that voice? That's Robbie? Robbie, can you say yes real quick? Yeah, one more time real quick. Okay? So Robbie is the most extroverted person I met. So we do inner circle. We have all of you guys come to Boise and we're there for a couple of days and like by the end of night one, I go to my room. I'm just like, oh my gosh. And Robbie comes in. We go like go out to eat with everybody. Go hang out. He's like, who's just getting tomorrow and the next day, the next day, the next day. Like he charges by being around everybody and I charge by hiding in my room, cowering from everybody. Okay? So that's the difference. Nothing wrong. Both are super powerful when you're building a dream team. Okay? So that's introverts, extroverts. Number two here. This is the S in the end. How many of you guys were S's on your personality test? Okay? How many of you guys were N's on your personality test? Interesting. Okay? So I'll go with the N's first. I understand the N. I understand the bottom row because I'm the bottom row right across. So N's, if you look at any good movie, the villain is always the N. Okay? Now that doesn't mean you guys are all evil. I'm not evil. What villains do? Villains will spend their entire life plotting and scheming some big huge way to take over the world, right? Hey, guys, remember the Incredibles? Right? What was the bad guy in the Incredibles? Syndrome, right? So syndrome had a bad experience as a little kid. He spent the next 50 years of life plotting and scheming to somehow kill Mr. Incredible. So much so he made weapons and made tons of money, built an island and robots and everything. Just so he had one shot to kill... Captain America... Or not Captain America, to kill Mr. Incredible, right? So N's the people who plot and scheme and they create these big visions. Okay? It's a superpower. Okay? The way that I was able to create a business, I sit down, I brainstorm, what can I do? I can do this. I can figure things out. My son Down is very much this way. Down's very much like, he's always planning the future and creating things like mapping out these big huge things, right? So that's what an N is. Now the S, on the other hand, is what most superheroes are. Superheroes respond to things, right? So what does that take? Over the world, Captain America's got to respond and fight back. Iron Man responds. Like you look at most superheroes, they're usually S's. They respond. Okay? So if you're someone who's an S, that means that when problems come your way, you may not be like plotting and scheming the next 30 years of your life, but when something comes your way and attacks you, you're ready to rock and roll and like you can start thinking about how to react, how to change, how to make things better. Okay? So both of those are superpowers, right? I need people on my team that can plan how to take over the world and I need people who will when crap hits the fan, they can react. So we need both of them. Both of them are superpowers. Okay? All right. Next one is the thinker and the feeler. Okay? How many of you guys were the T, your thinkers? How many of you guys were F, your feelers? Ooh, about half and half. This is really cool. Okay. So I am a feeler. My business partner, Todd, who developed ClickFunnels as a thinker. So it's fascinating when I call Todd on the phone, if I say Todd, how do you feel about this? He's like, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm like, Todd, what do you think about this? He's like, oh, and he's like a million, like the smartest man I've ever met on this planet ever, right? And Todd says, Russell, what do you think about this? I'm like, uh, seems cool. He's like, how do you feel? I'm like, oh, let me tell you how I feel. I can explain how I feel. My wife and I have the same thing. I used to always ask Collette, like, Collette, what do you think about this? And Collette's like, I don't know. I don't know. Because Collette's a feeler, like almost 100% feeler. So I was like, well, Collette, how do you feel about this? And then she can respond to me. Okay? Thinkers and feelers. Okay? It's important to have both of them because if it was just me running ClickFunnels, I promise you would have been bankrupt a long time ago because I feel really good about a lot of things. And then I like, Todd, what do you think about this? He's like, well, that seems really cool. But did you think about this, this, and this? I'm like, huh, never thought about any of those things. It felt really good, but that makes way more sense. We should definitely not do it, right? And so they check some balances. So both of those things are powerful and essential in any team. Okay? So you need thinkers and your feelers, but you need to understand what you are. And also understand who you're talking to. If you're talking to a thinker, don't ask them their feeling because they're going to be confused. Like, I don't have the words to actually enunciate thinking. I don't know. But I can tell you exactly how I feel at any given time. Okay? So I'm going to start with the first. All right. The last one is J and the P. How many guys are J's in the room? How many guys are P's in the room? Ooh, interesting. Okay. So you look at the J and the P's holding this little loop. Okay? So the P is a loop opener. Okay? So I am a hardcore P and I drive most of my team crazy because all my team are J's. So J's, they want to close loops. Okay? P's want to open them. J's want to close them. So what I do is I come into the office and I'm like, oh my gosh, you guys, I had this dream last night. I had this idea. We're going to do this. We're going to do this for everything. I'm opening this like vision and this dream. I'm so excited by it. And then my team starts driving me crazy because they all want to close loops. Okay? What task do we do first and second and third? And then what's going to do? And what's the due date? And I'm like, you guys are ruining it. And stop trying to close these loops. Like I'm not prepared for that yet. Like I'm just, this is a dream. It's probably not ever going to happen. Right? Fully understand. And so for a while it drove each other crazy. I want to strangle my team and they wanted to drown me at the same time. Like it was really, really bad until I started understanding this. I'm like, oh, you guys, we're just different. I'm a loop opener. And so I'll come in right now. I'm like, guys, I'm going to open a loop. Do not try to close it. You'll ruin my dream. You're random. I'm afraid I'm just going to talk for a little while. Don't take notes. Don't map out things. Don't put it on due dates. Just listen to me talk. And then I'll start telling this vision. You see them all twitching a little bit like trying to make notes. Don't take notes. Don't close that loop. I'm not ready yet. And then I go, okay, okay. And then we get done. My thing that I go, okay, so are we doing this? I'm like, I don't know. I'll tell you when we're ready to close the loop. And they're like, okay. And they can walk away and be like, okay, I don't have to worry about that. And then like a week later, a month later, two months later, I'm like, hey, remember what I think we talked about? I'm ready to close the loop. And then they're like, yeah, and they get all excited. They pull out their pens and their papers and their notepads and their trill and project management boards. And they do the whole thing. And they get excited. Okay. Both again are superpowers. You need both. If you only have a bunch of loop closers on your team, you're never going to have any vision. So you got to have both of them. Does that make sense? Okay. So I'm always, and it's important when you're talking to some know that they are the loop opener or loop closer. Keep trying to brainstorm or someone to try and close the loops are going to drive you crazy or vice versa. If you're a bunch of loop openers, you're going to have tons of vision. Nothing's ever going to get done. Okay. We got to have both. We got to have the whole to smashing and Ironman to think through things and Captain America to flex. Right. We need all the things. Okay. So that's how Myers-Briggs, I thought 16 personality works. So all of you guys have letters. So you could be at ENFJ or an ISFP and that's the phrase you want to learn. So for me, I'm an INFP. Okay. So I'm introverted. I'm always plotting and scheming. I'm a feeler. And I'm always opening up loops. Okay. But if any of you guys talk to me in five seconds, I can know everything about you. Yeah. You go this way. I am. So down, for example, my son down same thing as me. So I'm like, oh, down. I finally make sense. Like who you are. That makes total sense. And then Bowen took the test. Bowen and down are twins. Okay. They had the same thing except for one thing was different. Okay. Bowen is an ISFP. So Bowen is everything except for bones out plotting and scheming. Bowen's very racked, right? So things come to me can react. You can tweak. I can change things on the fly, which is really powerful. Okay. Todd, my business partner, ClickFunnels, I have the same. Ours is the same. We're both, or I'm an INFP. He's an INTP. So everything's the same except for the T and the F. So we have checks and balances between us. Okay. When we hire teams and we have people working with you, try to figure these things out so I know how to work with people, how, what motivates them, what doesn't motivate them, how to make sure that they're happy. Okay. So that's the first one. Myers-Briggs is really fun. The second one I had you guys take was disk. Come here, guys. Took disk. Okay. If you got disk pulled out, you get my goal. I'm not weird because I guarantee this lizard in the back of your guys' brain, some of them is like, you can't do that. You're introverted. You feel awkward in front of people. You can never talk on stage. You can't do a webinar because you don't have these skill sets, right? Or you're super extroverted and it's the opposite, right? Or like, when you start understanding, it's like, no, I'm not broken. I'm just different and that's good. I need to find people around me who I can surround myself with to actually be successful. That's the key I want you guys to understand here. Okay. Disk is the same thing. So disk is D-I-S-C. Okay. And usually you're going to have two things that are like your leader. You'll be a high D, high C or high I, high S. Like there's usually two letters. Okay. And one of them is going to be the biggest one. So how many guys was D your number one? The biggest thing was a D. Be cool. How many guys your biggest thing was an I? How many guys is your biggest thing an S? How many guys your biggest thing is C? Okay. Let me explain what that means because you understand your superpowers. Okay. A D is someone who is decisive. They're driven. They're insane. These are the people that drive you crazy. I happen to be a 99 D or something like that. Okay. So like when I have something I want, I go for it. When I want to be a state champion wrestler, I went, I went for it. I wanted to be, uh, when I want to make a million dollars, I make 10 million, 100 million. Like I come decisive and I run and I go. Okay. And so every good team needs someone who's a high D. Mandy who's here is someone who is, who taught me disk. And I remember, um, the natural path we go to super cool guy and he's trying to grow his business and he's struggling and like, I can't figure out why he can't grow. I help him. I get my dis might just do this or this or this. And the Mandy said, well, the reason why they're not growing. There's no D's in their, in their office. Everyone is an I and S or C. Like they're very organized. They're very big. There's no D's. I was like, Oh, it's not a D on the team. We need someone to smash. Like we need to Hulk smash. Right. The D is like the Hulk smash. Okay. So if you have a team right now and you're struggling, I can't grow our company. You've been struck for a long time. It's probably because you don't have a D on your team. Right. So get a D. Get someone who's going to be that person to smash the walls and get you to be successful. So that's what a D is. Okay. So what you want to do is somebody who likes to be on stage. You want people looking at you. Okay. You're the people who like, you want to be on the Facebook live, doing the videos, you want to be on the camera, you want to be to the podcast, you want to be here. Like you like the people to be to notice you. Okay. Who are my eyes again? You guys are all, you guys are the super, you guys are the superstars. Right. Guess in the band, who's the eye? The eyes, the head singer every single time. It's the dude or the lady who wants everybody to see him. Who's the lead, like that's the lead singer. Right. Okay. So that's what I is. S stabilizing. These are people that are super, super faithful. Okay. If you're married to an S, it's really nice because they're probably never going to leave you. You know, if you're an idiot, which is really cool, but don't be an idiot. Okay. Also, if you have someone that's S on your team, they're very faithful. They're not very likely to leave to cancel the walk away. Okay. S's are very, very faithful and then C are people who are very organized. That's a bit of a filing cabinet there. Okay. Because they're very able to like figure things out with step one, step two, step three. Okay. So in your disc profile, you just two letters that are big. Okay. Who can guess what my disc profile is? D.I. D.C.S. Okay. I apparently Mandy told my map. I'm abnormal. I have three high things. So I'm a high D, a high I and a high S and almost no C at all. I'm so unorganized, so messed up. That's why I have 400 employees to make to organize the chaos that I create in the wake of all the stuff we do. Right. But it's weird because most D's, if you're a high D usually like you plow over people and you get really offended, but I'm also high I something that I want people to like me a lot. And I'm also high S, which means I'm super. And so like I have this like constant turmoil in my head where I'm like, I want like, yellow people get stuff done and I'm also like, I want them to like me and like I'm super faithful. I don't want to offend them. And so like I have this constant like, but it's fascinating. You learn about yourself. I thought I was broken. It's like, no, I'm not broken. I just, these are things that, that the way that I'm kind of constructed. Okay. So for all of you guys is you're getting to know other people in this room and you're building teams, you're hiring employees. Like understanding this is so powerful. If you're inside your family, if you understand your kids, your spouse is like, you understand how to work with them. Right. Um, so that's kind of how that works. All right. And also side D's that gave you your motivators. I'll spend a little less time on this, but if you upgraded, there's like a camera 30 or 40 bucks, you can upgrade and get the motivator. This shows you what your biggest motivations are. Okay. So some of you guys are very, and you probably guessed this from most of you guys. Some of you guys are motivated by aesthetics. Things have to look really, really good. Usually our artists are designers. People like that are very aesthetic. How many guys, aesthetic is one of your top motivators. Okay. Number two is ROI. It's a return on investment. Now this one's interesting because I thought ROI meant how much money you're making. ROI doesn't. It means what is it like, what's the return on my investment right here? Okay. ROI is actually my number one motivator. So if I'm in the reason why I struggled in school so much is I could never see the ROI. Like, why am I doing this? I don't understand it. Right. So, um, uh, if I'm in a conversation and I can't, I'm like, why am I, I don't, am I getting any return on this investment? Like conversation is hard for me, but if I'm in a conversation, I'm getting good on return on my investment. Like, I mean, it's just ideas or value. Like I'll say that for a decade. I'll say that for a year or two, because I'm getting so much from there. Okay. There's individualistic. How many guys like individual like you just want freedom? That's why you're here. That's why freedom from the man. That could be your motivator. Political. So you guys want to be political and like do those things. Some are altruists and want to help people. Some are regulatory. They want to follow the rules. It's gonna be theoretical. You, the theoretical people have gone to like, they've got like 16 degrees. They've been in school and they've got like 16 doctorates, 32 masters. And they just love learning. That's the theoreticals. Okay. And so all these are important on your team. You need different, you need all these different type of people. Like I want to designers, high aesthetic. I want to the person who's running it to be high economic. I want like all these things are powerful, important parts of the team. Okay. So all of you guys are here hearing the same things. I'll share one last thing with you guys that my dad taught me when, when I was wrestling, one of the most, most powerful things he ever told me. So this is mostly for the kids. Can all the kids hear me right now? Okay. All the kids. It's one of the most important things for you here. Okay. So when I was, um, wrestling, I wanted to be a state champion. I wanted to be a national champion. I had these big goals, right? And I remember I would go into the wrestling room and I would be there with my teammates and all of us are wrestling and we had the same coach, same practice, same routine, same everything. And I remember doing everything that everyone was doing. And my dad, after, you know, I don't know, after three or four months of doing this, my dad came to me and said, look, he's like, I know you have big goals and you're doing what everyone else is doing. He's like, if you want to be successful, if you really want to win this game, you can't do what everyone else is doing. Everybody is learning exact same moves. Everyone's spending the same time. He's like, you got to do an extra 20%. He's like, champions do this extra 20% that other people are not willing to do. So if you'll do the extra 20%, that's how you're going to become a champion. So I was like, well, how do I, what do I do? Like, what does that look like, dad? And he's like, well, I'm going to come after practice. My dad would come as soon as practice, I know my dad would show up as soon as practice. And then I did a second practice every single day for four years. Right. I'd lift weights in the morning. I would run. I would do other things. I did the extra 20% that most people weren't willing to do. And because of that, I became successful. Same thing is true for you guys. You're all in the room with all these people here. All you guys are here in the same words come from my mouth and other speakers' mouths, except you guys say, okay, I'm going to do the extra 20%. I want to become a champion. I want to have success in the thing I'm doing. And again, I don't care if it's business. I don't care if it's, if it's athletics, if it's something else that doesn't matter to me, I just want you guys to be successful. I want you guys to be driven and not drifters. I want you guys to focus on that because if you can do that, you can literally change the world. Okay. And I know it's like a cliche thing to say, but I've seen it happen over and over and over and over again. I mean, Caleb Maddox, a 16-year-old kid making YouTube videos. And this is brutal. I don't know if he'll talk about this or not, but I used to read the comments and people were so brutal. More than anyone. He'd make, make these motivational videos for kids and people in the comments like, I hope you die, Caleb. I hope you go away and people were so brutal to him. And I asked him, I said, kid, why don't you quit? Like, this is, people are brutal to you in the comments. Like, I've never seen somebody brutal before. And he said, because I had five or six people tell me how much they hate me today. So I had two kids who told me they were planning on committing suicide and my video stopped them from doing that. Like, that's the power. Okay? That's what we need all you guys. Okay? The world's getting crazy. I need all of you guys, young entrepreneurs to step up because in a few years from now, I'm going to be old and wrinkly and dead and then it's going to be you guys are in charge of all this stuff. All right? So if we can inspire you guys and give you guys what you need, it's going to be awesome.
