## Transcript
I believe in the next six months, or once Tiny Challenge has become the thing, there'll be no more pro bono coaching. Like, Tiny Challenge will be the immediate next step. Like, pro bono will be dead. I just had a big idea that I'm gonna share at the end based on what you just said, because you just blew my mind or something. But I just had a, like, I had, like, a million dollar idea. Right, as you said that, okay. I'm legit like, blow, like, right now? You guys freaking out a little bit too? Huh. Hey, everybody. Today, I've got a really special guest, and I'm excited to talk to you about something really cool, because a lot of times, when people start a business, or they hear people talking about, I do the webinar, I have like 10,000 people who are challenged at all these things. A lot of times people are beginning to get overwhelmed, and they're just like, man, I can't do that. Like, I don't have the ability to have a challenge with a thousand people, or if I did have a challenge with a thousand people, I'd freak me out, because now I got a thousand people I talk to, and it's very overwhelming for people who want to be a coach, they want to be a trainer, they keep hearing these big numbers people talk about, but they get scared. And so the guest I have today is actually someone who I've been watching for the last few years, one of my favorite people in our community, super excited to have him here, but he started doing something recently where he was doing these little tiny challenges, mini challenges, tiny challenges, and I wanted him to kind of talk about this, because I think for any of you guys who want to become a big coach someday, or whatever that thing might be, but you're at the beginning, this is one of the most powerful, simple, easy ways to get started right out of the gate. And so our guest today is Richmond Dinh. Richmond, how are you doing today? Very good. Thanks for having me on, Russell. Yeah, he flew all the way from Australia to be with you guys here today to share this, but he's there inner circle means they, you've been in our inner circle now for how many years? Yeah, a bit over two years now. Two years. Obviously I've got there. Two years, two years painful. Yeah, he prepaid for two years, he's like, I'm not leaving. So he flies to Boise a couple of times a year from Australia, which is... Yeah, I mean, it's been so good. I mean, it's the only time I fly out of Australia now. It's just for these events. And that's, I mean, it makes the year really fast and really fun. Do your family think like, Boise, Idaho must be this huge, like tourist location, because we keep going there every day. I tell him how amazing he is. I'm so surprised on how beautiful the town is. Oh yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'll bring them here one day too. Yeah. That's awesome. All right, so let's get to this. So first off, I want to understand how you even stumbled upon this, right? Because I think most people they do a challenge, only a couple of people show up, they think it was a failure. And for you, it became like everything. So I'm just curious the backstory behind this. Yeah, or the backstory is four years ago, I heard about the idea of doing a challenge. And I was, I guess, I wasn't fully a beginner in my coaching journey, but I was, I wanted to run a challenge because it just made sense to build trust. But I had all the fears that everyone has. What if no one shows up? What if they do show up and ask a question or couldn't answer it? Or worse yet, like, how do I market it and how do I do it and what topics do I teach? And there's so many things. I wasn't speaking much back then as well. And so I've never really consistently speak to an audience five days in a row for that long. And my biggest fear was, like, if no one shows up, it's not a big deal because no one knows, right? And that's OK. But my biggest fear was, what if one person shows up? That would be the worst. And I thought about it. I thought, like, you know, sometimes in life, the worst things can be the best things. And like, if you can't, that's why you must. And if you don't have the money, it's why you should join the program because you don't have the money all the time. And so I asked myself the question, like, what if one person did show up? Like, would that be such a bad thing? I thought, well, not for them. Like, that would be the best thing for them. Oh, one-on-one challenge. 100% like, one-on-one time. And that would be a far superior offer for them. And then I thought, and I probably would close higher as well. And it might be a really cool thing. And then I got used to the idea about, you know what, actually, that might be actually a really good thing. And so I just went for it. And I thought, yeah, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this one-on-one challenge as a worst case scenario, but as a primary vehicle. And then it blew up into this crazy thing because I found out all these other benefits around it because of the traditional challenge. You've got problems of what date should I do it on? What time? Like, if I'm catering for the international market, should I do it at 8 p.m., 8 a.m., all this kind of stuff? But a one-on-one challenge, you can do it any time. It's an agreed time between you and the other person. You can start on a Saturday. It doesn't have to be the same time every day. You can have one day break. It had so much flexibility. And it took all the pressure away from running a traditional challenge. And it took all the fear away. And that's how that was born, the whole one-on-one challenge. Interesting. When you talked about how, like, if one person showed that would be, like, the scariest thing in the world, it reminded me the very first live event I ever did. It was actually right by the airport downtown Boise. And I'd just been to Dan Kennedy event. He was talking about doing an event. I'm going to do an event. So I remember we got some direct mail lists. We sent postcards to people. We ran a radio ad. And we had, like, 100 people sign up for this event. And we were going to do it three times per day. It was, like, morning, afternoon, night. And the very first one, I think we had, I don't know how many people were supposed to come, but, like, 10 people showed up. And it was, like, he said, OK, 10 is fine. And we kind of did the thing. And I think the room was set for, like, 30 people. So it was kind of like, they were sporadic, but it wasn't that bad. And then that was the first one. The second one that happened around lunchtime or whatever, only two people walked in. One sat in the very back and one sat in the very front. And I felt that, like, that fear. I was like, oh, no. And I, you know me, I talk fast anyway. And my 90-minute presentation, I delivered in about 13 minutes, because there were two people where I got so nervous. I was like, lululululu. And it was done. I was like, well, thanks for coming, guys. And then they kind of just awkwardly left. It was, and then the last one, I think we had, another, like, 12 people came to the last one. So it wasn't as bad. But the one that had the most fear for me was not the one ton of people. It was one with almost nobody. So I understand that conceptually to scare someone from even trying, because both sides are kind of scary, right? You got 1,000 people. That's scary, especially if I'm new, you get one. And so when you did, I'm curious, like, you had the idea, was it, was it more so that you became OK with the idea of one or did you orchestrate this to only be a challenge for one person? How did that work? Well, I first became OK with the idea of one. But then I thought myself, because I'm always asking myself the question, if I had to start all over, what would I do? And when I started seven years ago, there was no challenge. Like, challenge wasn't really, really a thing. But I would start on, like, one-on-one pro bono. Like, that's what all coaches should do. And I thought, because that's what I did. I did one-on-one pro bono for, like, six weeks, one call per week. And I thought, wow, if we did a one-on-one challenge, it'll compress that pro bono journey from six weeks into five days. And you're basically six-exing the speed of result from experience point of year. But then you get the resign opportunity because it's encompassing the challenge. And it's more attractive. And I thought, that's actually, that should be the way. Like, that should be the way for every beginner starting coach. Because pro bono, we all have to do it anyway. So it replaces the whole pro bono journey. And then the more I thought about it, the more I thought, this is crazy. Like, this is going to reduce every stress or overwhelming anxiety anyone has from even doing a challenge to 20 people or 100 people. And it's just a great way to start, is all to build up your skill set in presenting. Because there's zero presentation skills required. It's just can be done on the phone. You don't have to be good at tech because it can be done on the phone or just WhatsApp video or whatever. And it removes all that away. And then you get to learn how to craft your messaging, learn to see what offers sticks. And from that, it was like, this is the way. And we've got students who've made $100,000 just from this, faster than ever. You're just from the tiny challenge, the one-on-one challenge. I couldn't believe that they could get to $100,000. I thought, yes, this would be a great way to get to your first $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, for sure. But they're doing it all the way to $100,000. Now they've got a couple of hundred hours of coaching experience up their sleeve as well. And from a competency level, it's huge. Interesting. OK, so walk me through this. So someone decides they're going to do a tiny challenge. Is that a trademark? Yeah, well, I got to give credit. I did trademark it. Yeah. That was correct too, Pedro, because I was at Pedro's house and I said, hey, Pedro, a lot of your beginner students, the group challenge is overwhelming. We've actually been teaching one-on-one challenges to help him get the first $25,000, $50,000, and he's like, one-on-one? What's that? Like, done one-on-one? Like, you market it as one-on-one? It's like, that is crazy. That solves everything. And I said, yeah, it does. And I said to him, look, this is what we're teaching. And he's like, you got a name for it? And I, no. He said, well, you've got to come up with a fancy name, because otherwise, you've got to have a good marketing angle. So we're brainstorming, which we should have called it like the mini one or it's, you know, a market. And we came up with Tiny. And Tiny was just a perfect name. And then he said to me, Richmond, like, that's the name. And you've got to go trademark it. Like, OK, I'm going to go trademark it. So that's what we did. Oh, that's cool. So Tiny Challenge is the thing. It's official. OK, so walk me through just how it works. Like, what are your students doing? Or how did you do it? And curious, like, from everything, from how do you structure? What does the offer look like? Like, what are you doing day by day just to kind of help people understand what it looks like? Yeah. So, so it's different from a group challenge, because it's not done like, obviously, it's not done to an audience where you have to make it relevant to the room. So you can tailor the content specific to what they need. So the biggest difference on core one, I go through like a framework called like the five S, which means you can identify what are their fears, frustrations, what their future like, what are they want in the next five days in the next 12 months? Where have they failed in the past? And then what are they afraid of trying? And so we get all this data on core number one, which is data is dollars, right? And that's you can't get that data from a group challenge. And so they get that data and then we kind of say, OK, this is what you need. The challenge is topics going to XYZ, but because I'm hearing this, I might just tailor a little bit to what you're looking for over the next five days. And then when it comes to presenting the offer, it's as simple as because most brand new coaches don't know what to offer. It's like, hey, have you loved the five days? Like, yes, if I was to offer you something for $3,000, what would that look like to you? And they tell you what the offer is. It's and then you do that five times. You've got to prove an offer and then you can now create a proper offer from it. So it gives you the data immediately without having tried to second guess what should my offer be because you're. Yeah, it's it's it's so good. The data you get from this is amazing. And that's why when they trade transition from tiny to group challenges, the message is on point, the hook is on point, the offer is on point. And they're not going to do a challenge to 100 people and flop it. Yeah. So fascinating. I think some of the problems a lot of people have is they don't they've never tested the messaging, the hook, any of that kind of stuff. Like one of my favorite stories, Jamie Cross, who's been in a circle for a long time, like she came in as soon as she learned about funnels within like she launched her first funnel within like eight months at Two Comic Club and within like a year and a half. The two comic club acts like really fast. And I asked her, how did you do this? She's like, well, I spent the first two years of my business going door to door pitching my soap and then I did farmers markets pitching my soap. And she had done so much by time that like she did a funnel. It was like, oh, just pitch my soap. I've done it a million. I know what people's concerns are. The hot buttons, the thing that when someone's walking past a farm market, it gets them to stop, right? There's my hook. And like she knew all the things that she had done it ahead of time where most people like, oh, my funnel doesn't work. I try to say nobody bought. No one clicked on my ad and they're just because it's the first time of her doing it. Right. They have no idea what was actually important. Like you said, the data is powerful because really quickly you also get to hear like the way they're explaining things in their own words and they're like, oh, wow, they said this, they said this. And you start listening and it helps you to create the things you need to do. So how do how do people get their first clients? Is this something they're out of your buying attitude? He's talking one-on-one to find someone. How do they get their first client for something? Yeah, we'll recommend like to first of all, reach out to that immediate contact list. Family, friends, friends or friends, acquaintances, people they know in the past. And if they got a social media profile, like just put a post up that I'm hey, I'm offering a one-on-one thing for five days. That kind of post there and start there. Like most people were about to get 10 people from the immediate circle, like very, very easily. I mean, unless they haven't been a good person to people around them. Nobody likes you, really trust you. Yeah, which which is probably a good thing because it tells you what you need to work on next. Yeah, just step one. But we haven't had a problem with people not being able to get it organically first before they were to run ads. I mean, actually, no one's going to need to run ads for this. It's just very easy because on the last day, we have a referral strategy too. It's like, hey, if you love this, I would love to. Two of your friends would love this same experience and that's kind of how we grow it. OK, and then in theory, would they do the next one with two people or just two separate? Two separate, yeah. Like I would recommend they do at least minimum 10 times. And so they're selling at $3,000 for a five thousand. Like they're going to make about 30 to 50 thousand, right? The reason why that's important is because I'm doing it 10 times actually takes less time than doing a challenge, a group challenge, because it's delivered one on one, like a group challenge. As you know, a lot of marketing, a lot of folks love ads, a lot of all these stuff. So it's the time, the time it takes to do 10 tiny challenges is actually the same. But they get to present the offer 10 times and iterate 10 times and get 10 points of data. And so it's almost impossible to get 10 nos in a row because you're always iterating and getting feedback. Yeah. OK, so step one in this process, they go out there, they message their the warm audience, whatever it is, telling them that they're doing a five day challenge, one on one. If there's a difference, contact them. Do they filter like if you like someone messes you like, I know this person is broke or this person is not going to do like, like how do they how do they pick the right person? Yeah, take anybody. How does. Yeah, there is there is a criteria. So we do have a filtering process. We call it a commitment piece. And so the commitment piece, once they agree, OK, does this work for you? Like the time's work? OK, the final thing is and there's three types of commitment pieces we recommend. The first one is just donate twenty dollars to charity of your choice. And the way we frame that is because once you give you open yourself up to receiving, it's a good thing to do. And so just send me the screenshot once it's done and they do it. They can do that. The second thing is a commitment letter. So you have like a prewritten letter and say, I just want you to feel like I my name is, you know, Russell and I commit to it and they copy the letter, send it back to you. And that's a commitment piece. They say they're going to be committed to do it. And then the third one, you could charge like a very small price point, like seventeen dollars, twenty seven dollars, refundable deposit, just to make sure you're getting in the right people. But the crazy thing is there are no time wastes in a in a tiny challenge because no one turns up for five days to waste your time. People will download a free guide and wait. Like, you know, I mean, no one does that. People, if they're going to waste time, they'll go to other methods, but they won't stay for five days unless they were actually wanting change. So you actually qualifying them through the five days anyway, because otherwise they wouldn't show up. They actually want help. Yeah. Interesting. Do people do all three of those or pick one or? You just pick one. Yeah, I just said, hey, pick which one resonates with you the most and then use that as your commitment piece. I just had a big idea that I'm going to share at the end. Based on what you just said, because you just blew my mind or something. But I so if I forget, everyone, YouTube remind me to come back and and and drop this one because I said it like I had like a million dollar idea. Right. You said that. OK, so remember, coming back. All right. OK, so they messaged their friends. There's a filtering process to come through. There's a five day challenge day number one. He says the five F's walk the five F's again. Yep. What's it was first of all, paint the future, meaning what do they want? What's the goals for the next four months? Were the biggest frustrations where have they failed in the past? What have you tried and found? Fourth F is what are their fears? I want to know the most afraid of and the fifth F is framing. So framing the sale, right? And so asking for permission to be able to sell to them at the end of the five days. Hey, if you've loved this and this has been in my experience, would it be OK with you if I present to you what working with me on a paid basis looks like on day five and so you're getting the permission there. Very cool. OK, now that's day number one of the challenge. What happens now on day number two? Day number two is content piece number one, which is kind of following your framework. And what's your opportunity? What's the way? They reveal some sort of framework of their system of creating a result. And then they sign homework after that. And the homework is done on the call and then Q and A after the homework. Will you do the homework with them on the call? Yeah, yeah, yeah. This with challenge homework, what we suggest is make the homework small, meaning like all tiny that takes less than five minutes to do. Because when you leave, people to do the homework after the call, that I do it. But it also gives them the time. It's kind of kind of like running a workshop or a creative event. Like when you do it on the event on the call, they just move faster. And so we wait, like just wait and then they can send it into you or text you or whatever it is, but you just give them five minutes to do it. Yeah. OK, very cool. That's the content that's going to be happening. So content piece one, day three is content piece two, day four. So then when do you transition to pitch? How does that? Yeah. Yeah. So day five, day five is recap. And the five days. Let's recap what we did in the last five days. Amazing. Then we ask for referral. Hey, remember referral. If you love, could you think of two people that would love this? And then we transition into the offer. And so at that point, it's like, hey, remember day one, I mentioned, if it's OK by presenting what working we looks like and you transition to the offer. So the reason why we do it in that sequence is because we want to make sure that they feel good about the five days. So we do a quick recap and then they refer to people that's feeling good for that. And then we're going to the offer and then present the offer, handle objections and maybe for probably half the people that will need to book in that sixth call for, you know, another enrollment call because they need to think about it. Oh, gosh, so if they don't have it, then you follow up the call to do. Yeah. If that and buy on call number five, it's like we'll book in call number six to, you know, unless it's a hard no. And then, you know, just let it go, get the data, get the feedback, which is the more important part. Yeah. I just served you for the last week. Why? I would assume at that point, someone who's spent that much time investing in them, they almost feel obligation at the end of like, wow, like, yeah, they put a lot into that. And here's the thing that blew my mind, too. I had a client who sought a $15,000 program off a tiny challenge. And that makes sense because, because, um, of course you could sell something higher because there's more intimacy. And so I had a lot of people saying, oh, but which one? I've I've been doing group challenges and it's not really working. And maybe they've made 30, 40, 50 thousand dollars and they feel like they're taking a step back by doing this. When in fact, if they've got the experience and that skills and they're good at what they do, imagine they could sell a $20,000 program off. And I believe that would be very, very possible. Like you would do that. Yeah. Let me tell you my million dollar idea had five minutes ago when you were sitting there, I was just like, because first of all, it's such a good thing for beginners and all of a sudden I was like, OK, what if I want to do this? What if I said I'm going to do a five day one to one challenge and I put out to my audience at this point and I'm like, you're in five, one hours with me, we're going to do a process and framework to get you and maybe webinars. I'm going to help you to structure and build out a webinar. It's a hundred thousand dollars for five day challenge one on one with me. I think I could sell that. I think I could sell. Oh, yeah. I think I could sell five or ten maybe one a week for the next 10 weeks. Right. And then structure that the five days and the end of the five days to say something like, hey, based on this, you know, you spend a hundred grand for this. I have a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar offer where you actually come out here for a full one day. We're going to build out the rest of it and you have a chance to do a presentation of my event or whatever to do webinar. You know, and it's two hundred fifty grand. You already spent a hundred. So apply that. So it's like a hundred fifty grand. You do that. Like I could sell a hundred grand tiny challenge into a two fifty thousand dollar consulting day. I think that is so cool. Isn't that interesting? That's all right. I'm just going to try to challenge like because I think about like the big challenges, the big challenges are like, I love big. I've got obviously I love big challenges. A lot of people, a lot of mass, but you know, you're selling you're selling a thousand dollar offer or whatever. And so there's like, you know, there's the people who want premium, the people want low ticket. And so it's kind of like you're targeting this group in the middle. But I think with tiny challenges, again, you can you can target that group. You can also just shifting around. Like if Dan Kennedy charged me, you know, fifty grand to do five one hour calls with me for a week and the end of it pitched, I got to come and hang out with me and write my copy for like done. I mean, twice about it. You know what I mean? Like what if I just one or two of those a month? Anyway, I don't know. That's just kind of an interesting mind. I would do that. Just had to be. Yeah. Yeah. Now they got me thinking. Wow, that's that's amazing. All right. This is now tiny challenges. It's too huge. Yeah. Anyway, that's cool. Okay. Sorry. Back to it doesn't have to be five could be three calls. We recommend minimum three calls, maximum seven calls. So three to seven is a sweet spot. Five is a good number. Very cool. OK, so now I wanted some data based on the clients and students you have going through this process like what and I know with close rates, it's all over the place. I'm curious what's what it was looking like is one out of 10 or sign up for three out of 10. We've never had someone do zero out of 10. Like it's the average is three out of 10 in the first 10. And then the averages go up on the next 10. Then it becomes four out of 10 and next 10 is five or six out of 10. They just get better. And so our record student, she's done like 55 of these and her first 10 was like three out of 10. But then to was it back and she was closing seven out of 10. It just became and that's she became addicted to it. She didn't want to do group challenges. It's like this is way better. Yeah, it is. It just was working. What price point was she selling them? Five thousand five thousand. You didn't start five thousand. The first one's two thousand and it went up. You get more confident. Yeah, of course. Yeah. And then the fulfillment, like you said that you asked them kind of what the fulfillment looked like. But traditionally, what is it? Is it more is it like doing more one on one calls? Yeah, more of the same, more of the same. So so basically they got five days of one on one and then you're selling like what you said, like one day one on one or they usually sell like three months or six months of one on one coaching. Yeah. That's so cool. Yeah. You want to hear something really cool? Yeah. Because the next stage is people think group challenges the next stage. But actually one of my students did what she called a hybrid challenge. And I'm like, what's that? Because she had she transitioned from tiny to group. But then she had like 10 people in the group at only five per shop. And then said, what did you do with other five? I did a tiny challenge. And so it was a 100 percent shop rate for a small challenge. And she called it a hybrid challenge. That's amazing. And so 100 percent show rate. So she did group to be able to shop to the group calls. And then the people couldn't shop. She didn't want to mind. Interesting. What if we did I saw another idea. What if you did something where again, I think I might like if I do a hundred thousand dollar five day with somebody, but then that people pay a thousand dollars to listen in and just watch it. Whoa. Because then it's like you get the hundred grand a person to make it 10 people to pay you a you know, whatever. That would be 20 or 30 people. That could be really fascinating. Like the decade in a day. Like I never say to watch other people get coached through it. That was more valuable for me than yeah. And then that yeah. A risk of flu 18 hours to voice the Idaho for a 15 minute consult with him. But you were in the room for one day and then you flew back out, which is crazy. And thank you. That was amazing that you did that. But yeah, there's something valuable about that. Like I wonder if you could sell tickets to anyway. Sorry, there's so many iterations off of this that are really interesting and fascinating. Man, I want to do one really bad right now. Anyway, sorry. I digress. Yeah. And you'll be attracting the best clients too for that, for what you're thinking, it'll be amazing. So cool. OK, the next question for you then. So you talked about how some of your clients have gotten these. You know, it wasn't just like they made 30 grand or 50. Like they're getting higher levels. Is it mostly just they keep doing it or are they moving from one thing to the next? Or like what are the other ways to keep increasing the prices or increase in the price of the offer or just the what they're making through these through these funnels? Yeah. So they just keep doing it. It's keeping doing the same like this. You know, I've never run out of leads because I mean, you know, 21. Exactly. You only need one. Put an ad out, spend $30. That's it. If you wanted to run out, like, I mean, it's it's too easy. You may be good 10 people apply. But the shop rate is 100 percent because it's the reason why people in the shop is either not relevant or the time doesn't work. But it's it's a tiny challenge. So the time always works. The time work, whether they they're going to schedule it. Exactly. So fascinating. Huh. This is like one of the most simple, most brilliant things I think I've ever heard. Yeah. It's cool because you're structuring as a challenge. You think about this like when you do a pro bono work, you're selling coaching calls. I'm going to be six coaching and they're expecting coaching calls. The challenge is different. Right. You're like, you have the ability to set the tone on number one and the ability to sell at the end because it's framed in a way that's not like. Wait, I thought I was getting free coaching. You know what I mean? Exactly. So I believe in the next six months, or once tiny challenges become the thing, there'll be no more pro bono coaching. Like like tiny challenge will be the immediate next step. Like pro bono will be dead because it does the pro bono in one. Yeah. So fascinating. I didn't know it's actually because lead gen simple on this, the funnel simple, the follow through simple, the sales script is simple. The tech. The tech is simple. And the hardest is to help someone make the first 10 K like that is the hardest dollar. Yeah. Man, such a cool thing. Well, dang, what are we missing? What are other things people should be thinking about? With tiny challenges, I would say I'm legit like blow like right now. Are you guys freaking out a little bit too? Oh, I love you. I love your million dollar idea. Like that is better. I take a tiny challenge. Wow. Yeah. Think about like any market this is working. I'm thinking because for me, it's like even doing a big challenge. Like you said, there's a lot of work that goes into like me doing a big challenge. I'm like, this would be something simple. Like I could just have one client a week to go through. I'm spending an hour a day in my week for this really cool thing that leads to a million dollar a day or whatever those things are at the back of it. Like that becomes worth my time even condition. I was like, like, who's going to spend the time to do a tiny one on one challenge? Like, like in my mind, I have to be a complete beginner because it's not going to work through time. But even at my level, it's like it's still worth my time. If that was destruction, the payment differently, but the same outcome, the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. It's amazing. Yeah. Maybe, you know what? Maybe I'll borrow your idea and I'll run the first one, let you know how it goes. And so one on one. We're going to race because I'm going to do it tonight because I'm like, you know what? I was just thinking like, just how cool would that be to? Anyway, it's a whoever's the first one is going to get the best traction because it's such a unique thing that everyone's going to copy us. So we got to make sure we implement this before this video goes live on YouTube. By the time you guys see this, it'll be live and relaxing happening, which will be amazing. Okay. I want to transition a little bit. So what I'm excited for is when you first kind of presented this idea to me and you've been in a circle for a long time, it's been fun watching your journey and seeing the things you're doing. But I didn't know that you were doing these things and you'd message me saying, Hey, this is something I think that everybody in your community should be, should learn about and understand. You kind of walked me through just kind of a quick version of this. I was like, Oh, that's really, really cool. And so this year's we were planning out funnel hiking live. It's cool because this year the events can be a little different than years in the past. It's going to be a virtual event. What means we'll be streaming all around the world. It's fun like live international. We've got huge audiences in Brazil and all these different countries that we'll be streaming into. So it'll actually be the biggest funnel hiking. I mean, though it's, it's virtual, but I wanted to structure it in a way where it's not just, um, you know, like some fun like lives, a lot of like random, cool presentations about different things you could do. And last year's fun like life is all about the Lynch pin, very specific. And this year I wanted to transition where the very first day is all about how to go from, from I'm a startup business owner to my first million dollars. Like what, that's the first day, right? And the number two, like how do I go from million or sorry, start up to like six figures. Day number two is like six figures to seven day, three, seven to eight and eight, uh, four is, is eight and beyond. Right. So day four, we have like a couple billionaires who can come speak, which is really cool. But day number one, I'm like, um, I'm like, what are the things that anybody could do right out of the gate? And, uh, you are actually the very first person that I've asked to speak with my hiking live this year because I wanted you to show this thing. Cause I think it's for so many people who have been struggling for so long, you know, they get, they struggle with the tech, the complication, the strut, like all the, so many things to be successful. We're here, if you have a message, if you have something that, that can change somebody's life legitimately, like you can do this that fast. That it's not going to cost you money and, you know, you have to learn, you have to learn a thousand things. Just like you're out of the, the races. So I'm pumped to, to this would be the official announcements was watching, um, that you're speaking at photo hacking live this year. You go deeper into this whole, this whole model. And, um, I'm excited cause, um, I'm excited to, to see other case studies of people who are actually doing this, you know, um, how many people you had kind of go through this process with you so far? We've been teaching this for years. We just didn't even have full name for it. And so you tie a name to that becomes amazing. Which is the lesson for everyone as well. You need your own proprietary name. That's true. That's true. The power of just having a name and giving it a name. Um, I would say, oh, 200, like a lot, a lot of students, particularly in the last 12 months when we really made it the main thing, like the main thing. It was, it was always like a side thing, like an extra thing, but now it's like the main vehicle. And so, um, and the results have been the fastest results we've ever seen. And with the least limiting beliefs, like, you know, imposter, all that, all those things, fear of judgment, all that kind of stuff that comes through. There's not much of that. I mean, there's a little bit, but not much. It's not enough to stop people from doing it. Yeah. So cool. We throw a couple of the industries people are doing this, to get an idea of like, it could be almost anything. Yeah. The most, um, the most interesting one was, um, or two, um, Qigong, I got a client that didn't like learn Qigong, which is like some sort of, um, I think it's like Chinese martial arts, like kind of like Tai Chi and an accountant. Like she was like, no, accountants will not do a challenge yet. I learned a Chinese challenge, but of course they would. Cause there's a problem you can solve in less time or easier for them. Of course they're going to want to do it. And yeah, an accountant doing a tiny challenge. It's pretty cool. Yeah. Very fascinating. And you think about this, like diagnosis, when you're selling anything, like the more time you spend with a person, the more likely they are to buy something. Right. So why I'm such a big believer in podcasts, cause you know, they may see Instagram or they see, they see different things in a short form, but as soon as they, you get something on your podcast and they spend an hour with you every day, you know, like, or once a week, whatever, like you spend so much more time, they're more and more likely to buy from you. In fact, when we first launched my inner circle back in the day, it was fascinating because, you know, I didn't know who, like we put it out there to our whole audience, people showed up and was fascinating is of the hundred people who joined the inner circle during the very first time we ever launched it. Uh, it was like 90 some odd percent of people, um, had came into my world and then they listened to podcast for like eight months a year. And then they were, they jumped in and signed for your circle out of taking twice, like that was, it was the more, there was a direct correlation in how much time I spent with somebody, how much money they were willing to spend with me. And this is like the tiny challenge you're spending five, like you have so much time with somebody, like, like to prove yourself, to show that your stuff's working all the kind of things. Like there was so much more likely you're taking, you know, a month and a half before to them listening to podcasts, you're catering it directly to them, spending the time, they're seeing the value. And then, um, as long as you have the next logical, logical step, like, oh, here's where we're going to go from there. Like it's, it's, uh, and it's quality time too. It's way, it's the most intimate time you could have with someone directly. So though, I guess those five hours will be equivalent to potentially 50 hours of consuming content on YouTube or podcasts or anything. It's just so intimate. They feel like they've known you forever because even after a five day group challenge, you know, everyone feels like I've been here for, I feel like I've known you forever and it feels like you've been in a challenge for such a long time, you lose this as a time, but in the tiny challenge, that, that whole time perception is exaggerated even more. Yeah. Oh, so fascinating. Well, thanks man for sharing this. I can't wait for you to be speaking in front of Hockey Live, the shows with everybody in the world and show specifically exactly how they connect, you know, but even this video alone, like I've got 500 ideas on different things I can start doing, like immediately. In fact, it's what so called jamming out with you because, but, um, I love how when you hear great ideas, you just take it to like, to the next level. Yeah. Well, it's funny cause I'm not going to lie. When you first start talking to this, like in my head, I'm like, I will never do this ever until like that thing clicked. And I was like, I can actually do this cause it's funny. Like, you know, in her circle, I lean into this and her, she has her $250,000 consulting day and Myron's got it, just 350,000 things. And I'm like, I don't even have the guts to offer that. I'm like, how do you even offer that to somebody? You know what I mean? Like, I email my list about like, how do you even, but I was like, this would be the way this is exactly. Like if I went out to my list and said, we're going to, I'm going to do, I'm doing five, five day one on one challenges people. It's going to be a hundred grand each. And then the end of it, I'm going to pick two of you guys to do a private, you know, they've knew ahead of time. Like, it's like, they're all fighting for, I don't like, I'm going to be the best student, I'm going to be the best student cause I'm only two of them going to have the thing, you know, whatever it might be. It'd be super fascinating. It's fun for me too, because you know about this project, but I'm building this huge library and we ended up transitioning. We're buying a movie theater, right? Um, which is really cool. So it's this huge movie theater, but we had to rehab it. So I got a lot of money to rehab it, but then I don't have enough to finish the project. So I'm like, how in the world, you know, on month 12 on this project, like we're going to need a million dollars today. I'm like, how am I going to pull out a million dollars? And like this literally gave me the idea of just like, Oh my gosh, every time the next construction loan, you know, I could go to a banking, it'd been said, we're going to the bank and it's like, I'm going to do four many challenges, which will give me, you know, the money up front. And then from that, if I get two people to buy the thing, like there's the money to cover this month's, you know, of the construction or whatever. If I do that two or three times that page for the entire thing. And anyway, so zero ad spend. 100% is your, I think I could build a waiting list. I think again, selling people access to watch me. Anyway, there's so many fun ideas off of this. It is insane, but this is not about me, you guys. This is about the beginner who's just getting started. So for anyone who's advanced who wills are spinning, let us know in the comments down below, but for the beginners, I hope you guys take this. This is something that's been proven to work 200 plus clients doing this. Um, but it's again, it's something I think anybody can do at whatever level. If you've got some kind of expertise in a topic, something that you know, you can help other people with. This is a fast, easy way to just get it done. Spend an hour a day doing this for a week and just test it out. You know, and you said, if you do it 10 times, the average person's getting three the first time around, right? Yeah. We've the worst, the worst clothes, right? Has been one out of 10. We've never had zero. I never, and I kept on telling him, don't be the first one. It's all on me. Yeah. So think about it. I'm thinking about somebody who's like, I need to make 30 grand this month. Like, how do I do that? Like, okay, you're going to have a $3,000 offer. You got 10, I had seven fingers, 10 tiny challenges. You do what in the next 30 days, if you do two a week. Three a week, whatever the math is on that. You could do four or five a week, like quite easily. That's just, you know, that's a couple of calls a day. It's very manageable because there's not much marketing involved with it. It's just, it's not much prep work. Yeah. I have a dozen friends right now who I know are struggling, who I'm literally going to send this video before he even gets out to YouTube just because it's like, this is the plan. Just go do this first. I get so simple. A lot of them who are doing, they're posting on social, they're doing these kind of things, trying to get clients for their hire, you know, for literally a $3,000 package, but they don't have the selling mechanism. Like they're struggling because it's like some sees it and then they got a sell and it's just like this weird transition that they're kind of figuring out what this is like, such a simpler, more powerful thing. So I love it, man. Anyway, thank you for being here and for sharing all this stuff. I can't wait for you to be a fucking live international streaming around the world, sharing this kind of stuff as well. I think it's a change a ton of people's lives. And I'm just grateful for you, man. I love having you here and I look up to you and just I love having you. So likewise, Russell. It's the same and I'm excited too, because I believe that this is something the market has really been hungry for that hasn't been like, hasn't been like it's, it's really innovative too. It's going to change the industry. So I'm grateful for the opportunity because, you know, obviously to get this out there, we need a platform and so I'm so, so looking forward to it. It's awesome. All right. Tiny challenges, you guys. Go to your first tiny challenge and come to Funal Hacking Live so you can watch, listen and teach you guys all the behind the scenes secrets. So thanks man for being here. Appreciate you. And I hope this is a ton of value for all you guys.
