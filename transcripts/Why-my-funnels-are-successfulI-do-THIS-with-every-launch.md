What's up everybody? It's Russell Brunson and welcome to the Marketing Seekers podcast. So what most people don't know is most of the times when I launch a funnel, guess what? It doesn't do very good. But Russell, I thought you're the funnel guy. Everything's perfect. No, it's not. This is the difference between me and everybody else. What happened? I do a funnel and I do the best one that I know how. Now this is what a lot of people do, the high-ranking coaching, they call me like, hey Russell, what do you think about this? Is it good or is it bad? Like, I don't know what the market say. Like, what do you mean? I'm like, I don't know if it's good or bad. Like, I'm just a dude who just looks at what's proven and try to model it. And I have no idea if it's going to work or not. And like, but Russell, you're the funnel guy. You should know all this stuff. No, I have no idea. All I do is I go and I let the market vote. Okay? I ask the market its opinion. I say, hey market, does this funnel give you an offer that you actually want to buy? And does it convince you and persuade you to do it? Guess what I don't do? I don't ask for people's opinions because I sent my wife or my mom or my friends or other marketers, they're like, ah, well, I would change this. I would tweet and they would give me all these things that I think the only person whose opinion I care about is my customer. And the only way I care about their opinion is not when they tell me, like, eh, right in Facebook, I'd like, this seems scammy. Like, I don't care about any aircraft, only I care about people voting with this thing right here. So I'm going to see, will they open their wallet and pull out a credit card and buy the thing? If they did, that is the vote I care about. Okay? So that's all I do. So we create something and then I do is what we should take about, depending on the offer, but probably around a thousand bucks. And we go, usually the Facebook nowadays, that's the fastest way to test things. And then we spend a thousand bucks on Facebook, we throw it out there, and then we just sit back. What are you doing Russell? I'm like, I'm watching, I'm letting the market tell me what works and what doesn't work. So I sit there, I let the market and then the traffic starts going through, people are clicking and they go through, they go to page one, page two, page, and I just watch. And this is the hard part, most people are freaking out, I'll get a message like, I logged yesterday, what's happening? I'm like, dude, just relax. This is the thousand dollar investment to have the market tell you if your funnel is good or not, right? So you spend a thousand bucks, traffic goes through, and then it's something like, I don't have a thousand dollars to waste, Russell. The word waste is the wrong word. This is, you're spending a thousand dollars on market research to get the actual market to tell you if it works or not. And they're telling you by voting with their credit card, like that's the magic. And it was done. Then I come back and I look at it. Okay, here's my funnel, page one, page two, page three, page four, like, do you just four or five pages as an entire funnel? I look at it. Okay, what percentage of the people that landed on page number one did the thing I wanted to do? I wanted them to give me an email address. I wanted them to join me on Facebook Messenger. I wanted them to put in the credit card, like whatever it is. And then what percent of people did page two, page three, page four? And then I just look at that. And like, I literally, we made these scorecards last night. There's this big scorecard that shows you what percentage of each thing. And look at it, I'm like, okay, was that percentage good or bad? And first year of nobody, after a while, you get kind of a gut feeling like, oh, this is, this is good. This is bad. So we look at that, you know, like option rate was like 11%. That seems really low. So okay, I'm going to change that. And then look at everything else. Everything else looks pretty good. Like, I make a split test, best of my knowledge, like what things that I tweak and change. So I make those changes, then I go back and I buy some more market research, spend another 1000 bucks or 500 bucks or whatever. And I push it and we do this process three or four times. And usually in three or four times, we go from a crappy funnel to a winter, winter chicken dinner. We give a winter, winter chicken dinner. That's when you start promoting it. So we drive traffic and ads and money and everything. And that's me start scaling. But don't even assume for a second that I just guess. And that's it. I guess and then I have the market tell me. And then I tweak the market, tell me tweak with the mark, tell me, and then I roll out a phone. That's the process guys. Appreciate you guys. Funnel audibles. It's the key. It's the secret is how you go from good funnels to great from bad funnels to good. And from wherever you got to where you want to be. So learn how to do it, master it and have fun with it.
