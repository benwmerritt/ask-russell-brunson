Hey, this is Russell Brunson. This is for anyone who's an author, a speaker, a coach, or a consultant. You have a framework, you have something you teach, and try to figure out how to make more money without putting in more effort. So this video is for you. Right now, I'm actually at the Napoleon Hill Foundation. I've had a chance to be here after hours, going through all the archives, the manuscripts, everything Napoleon Hill had. And I had an epiphany today, and I wanted to share with you guys, because this is something that he did over maybe an 70, 80-year career, did over and over and over again. And when I saw this today, I was just like, I got to share this, because this is something that any of you guys can do. Most of us have some framework we teach, right? And the books I've written, I have frameworks teach people how to build funnels, how to write copy, how to tell stories, how to drive traffic, right? Have these frameworks. And I'm always thinking, like, I've got to create another framework and another framework, right? And that's exhausting. It's hard, right? But like in Napoleon Hill, what he did was very, very fascinating, and he built a huge empire based on having one core framework. And before I go deep into the Napoleon Hill stuff, I have another friend. Her name's Brooke Castillo. You may have seen Brooke. She's one of the biggest life coaches on the planet. She coaches life coaches. And her entire empire, $100 million plus empire, was built off of one core framework, right? So there's people who are doing this today. But most of us are so like in this hamster wheel of content creation, we never actually get there. So this hack from Napoleon Hill, I'm going to show you guys today, will change everything for you, OK? And I got some really cool examples to actually show this in actual practicality. So if you've ever studied Napoleon Hill, a lot of you guys know the book Think and Grow Rich. This book's amazing, but this is not what he did first, OK? He first met Andrew Carnegie, the richest man on the planet. And Carnegie told him, he said, look, you've spent 20 years of your life creating the first ever philosophy on personal achievement. So Napoleon Hill left from that and spent 20 years interviewing the richest man in the world, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, like all the people back then who were the biggest titans of industry. He interviewed them all to find out how they were successful. And they interviewed even more people who were not successful to figure out what are the things successful people are doing and what unsuccessful people are not doing. And from there, here are the very first books that he had called The Law of Success. If you ever seen a force, a huge book set like this big, but I happen to be at the Napoleon Hill Foundation, and I happen to find in a cupboard over here the original manuscript for Law of Success. Check it out. This thing is huge. This is straight from Napoleon Hill's typewriter. This is something that I could sell in eBay right now for probably $2 million, and it is the coolest thing I've ever seen. But if you open up The Law of Success, I'm going to open up the title page. He spent 20 years interviewing all these people, and from there, he created his framework, his initial outline for what he teaches. And for him, they were Laws of Success. And so the very first law is definite and a purpose. Number two is confidence. Number three is initiative. Number four is imagination. Number five is action. Number six, enthusiasm, self-control, doing more than you're paid for, attractive personality, accurate thought, concentration, tolerance, failure, cooperation, golden rule. 15. Those were his 15 laws that he put together The Law of Success. And then this book, each section of this book is one law, right? So he has the law, and he has stories, he's got things he teaches, he's got all the stuff like to teach you how to take this law and implement it into your life. This is the manuscript, if you see a copy, that's this huge book set, and that was the very first thing he ever published, right? And that's not actually completely true. Prior to him publishing that, he actually published a magazine. I'll talk about that here in a minute. So if you look at Napoleon, that's the framework he teaches, right? Just like you have a framework, that's his 15 laws that he has as a framework. Now over time, he ended up finding a couple of other laws he added to there, which again, if you study Napoleon, you know that sometimes he had 17 laws of success, and he had 16, and I'll talk about that and some of the evolution, but it all started with 15 core things in his framework that his entire philosophy was built on. So my first question for you is, your philosophy, I think you're teaching your people, do you have a framework? Framework's the what rules this entire planet, right? Framework is the outline for what you're teaching. You take the framework and from there, you can write a huge book like this if you want it. Now from there, Napoleon did a lot of things. After he launched Law of Success, a little while later, he launched a club called the Thirteen Club, and in here, it says, and the 15 laws of success, and this was a monthly continuity program, people paying monthly, every single thing they pay for, and they get this newsletter where he's teaching one of the laws of success and going deep into it. This first issue right here is talking about the Law of the Mastermind, right? And so one of the laws, he talks about it, and each month they get a new newsletter like this in the mail. This is the only copy of actually, See the Thirteen Club, this is original, I'm jealous I want it, but again, he took his framework and turned it into a continuity program, a monthly, like a membership side, but through print newsletter, right? Which was amazing. A little while later, he wrote a book that's the one everyone's heard of, which is Think and Grow Rich. Now what Think and Grow Rich is, he basically took the exact same framework he had in Law of Success, right? This huge, like the biggest book almost known to man, right? This huge framework right here, he's like, no one's reading this thing, because it's so big, I'm not sure people read it, but he's like, I wanna make a condensed version specifically for entrepreneurs, right? So he's like, what do entrepreneurs want? They want to use success principles to get rich. And so he wrote this book called Think and Grow Rich. Now in Think and Grow Rich, he shrunk it down to 13. He took 13 of the principles from success, from his original framework, he put it into here, and he rewrote this book focusing on people who wanna actually think and grow rich, to actually make money. So these are entrepreneurs, small business owners, people who wanna make money, right? And that became this book. Now what's fascinating is people will spend more money for the exact same content packaged in a different way. I believe that there, I'm gonna come back to it a little bit. People will spend more money for the exact same content or frameworks packaged in a different way. So this was packaged differently, right? Packaged for entrepreneurs. Now after that, he's like, okay, I have this, I have a lot of success as universal for everybody. This book ended selling over 100 million copies in the next 100 years, whatever, it's just crazy. But he's like, how do I take these laws of success? How do I apply them towards employees of companies, right? And employees not gonna read this probably. So what would an employee want? Well, they wanna learn how to raise their own salary. So there's a book called How to Raise Your Own Salary. Guess what this book is? 13 of these principles put in here, same laws, same framework, but specifically teaching employees how to make more money inside of their jobs, how to raise their own salary. It's so crazy. And in here, you see it's the same frameworks that he's teaching different stories. So there's stories inside of frameworks that he teaches entrepreneurs, different ones that he teaches for employees. But it didn't end there, it kept going, right? In fact, one year after he wrote Thinking Girl Rich, he wrote another book that didn't get published for a long, long time. You've probably heard of it before. It's actually my favorite Napoleon Hill book and it's called Outwitting the Devil. Now it wouldn't devil's fascinating because he took these exact same success principles, laws of success, same framework. Instead, he inserted it into a conversation with him and the devil. And they're going back and forth talking about stuff but they're talking about the principles of success. And he asked the devil, like how are you holding men back from being successful? And it was basically the opposite of laws of success. I'm making people not have definite interests and purpose and making them become drifters. I'm having their not to be, I'm doing the opposite. So it's like taking the laws of success and flipping them backwards and that's what Outwitting the Devil was. And what's crazy, because we're here, I gotta show you this stuff. This is the actual manuscript of the book, Outwitting the Devil. Once again, here in the archives. So this is from Napoleon Hill's typewriter. Come on now, that is so cool. But wait, there's more. After it laws of success, before he wrote Think and Grow it, he wrote a book called The Magic Loudness Success. And guess what this magic loudness success happens to be? I'll give you a hint. It's a very similar framework to the laws of success. Just taught differently. Lesson number one, the mastermind. Oh, that's lesson number one, the laws of success. Lesson number two, definite chief aim. That's lesson number two in the laws of success. Oh, number three, self-confidence. The habit of saving, initially like the same framework, packaged in a different way. Now this one actually had 16 lessons. I don't know, he's got a habit of health here, 17. So we added a couple here. So this is Magic Loudness Success. Same frameworks, packaged differently, shorter, more concise, faster to read, more interesting for a different type of person. Magic Loudness Success. Okay, here's another one. Think your way to wealth. How do you think your way to wealth? Similar to Think and Grow it, right? You stick the same frameworks, package it differently, think your way to wealth. Same laws, different stories. Think your way to action pack. This is taking the same laws, right? Now this is like a workbook to go with the actual framework. The master key to riches. Very interesting. If you read the master key to riches, guess what's inside here? Same framework, different stories, different hook on the front of the book. How to sell your way to wealth. Okay, how do you think you sell your way to wealth? Well, you have to have these 17 principles, teaches you how to sell your way to wealth. Same framework, different hook, different stories, different audience. You guys are getting this, you guys are making sense to you guys. But wait, there's more. Before he actually launched Laws of Success, as he was studying these things and figuring out everything, he launched a magazine. In the first magazine he launched, it was called Hills Golden Rule. I found some copies here. I actually have a complete set of every single one of these, but this is what Hills Golden Rule was, he launched a magazine. And as you know, one of the Laws of Success, the last one is the Golden Rule. And so this entire magazine is called Hills Golden Rule. As he was learning these Laws of Success, he was publishing them all in the magazine. He was telling stories about people around the world who are living these Laws of Success. And every single month, people would buy these magazines. Now again, this was another continuity program. It was 20 cents per month, per copy. People sign up every month, they would get this magazine in the mail. He ran this for a year and eight months, and then him and his business partner got a big fight. And it shifted from Hills Golden Rule magazine to he kicked Napoleon Hill out, then became Golden Rule magazine. And again, I have every issue of the Hills Golden Rule, I've got a bunch of the Golden Rules. Then a year later, Napoleon Hill, before he finished Laws of Success, was like, I'm gonna launch a new magazine. So he launched a new magazine, and the new one is called Napoleon Hill Magazine. And if you look at Napoleon Hill Magazine, first off, these are like the most beautiful magazines in the world. They have different colors and stuff, but this is Napoleon Hill Magazine. And if you read inside of here, guess what you're gonna find? 15 steps of this framework, taught through different articles every single month. One of these is gonna talk about Mastermind, one of these is gonna talk about definite purpose, and you just find different stories, different things to teach the same framework, different stories, different hook, monthly continuity program, okay? Does this make any sense, you guys getting this? Okay, but wait, there's even more. I can show you tons of things. Again, people will spend more money for the same content or framework package in a different way. I remember the very first time, I was at a seminar, I was at a speak grass, who here's there, thinking, Grinch, and the whole audience to have for me his hands went up. So we were buying a copy of it. I bought it on eBay for $10. I was like, I'm gonna read this book, so it changed my life, and we're buying it, showed up. I put it up next to my nightstand on my bed, and I looked at it for like five or six months, I never read it, never read it. I remember going to another event, and never was like, who here's there thinking, Grinch? Everyone's hands go up, except for mine. I'm like, oh, I'm an idiot, I gotta remember to read it. Went back home, didn't read it, didn't read it. Went to my third event, someone goes, who's there thinking, Grinch? Everyone's hand goes up, and I remember writing on my paper, I drew a star, I'll make a pad of paper, I was like, buy an audio version of Thinking, Grinch. So I went to eBay that night in my hotel room, I remember going, and I found a CD version of Thinking, Grinch for $97. This is before there were audio books in Ottawa, so if I bought it, it shows up, and I remember putting it, the CD is my card, listening to it, and eventually I read through audio books, Thinking, Grinch, right? Now, my question for you is, what's the difference between the audio book, Thinking, Grinch, and the physical book, Thinking, Grinch? Well, one cost me $10, one cost me $100, 10 times the most money, what's the difference? There is no difference, literally word for word is the same, somebody reading the book, I spent more money for the same content, packaged in a different way. So Napoleon Hill understood this, we started packaging it in different ways, like he went and he like, oh, let's make the science personal achievement, going through the 17 laws of success, and he turned it into a tape set, right? He made a tape set of it, eventually made CD sets of it. Another really cool thing is Napoleon Hill, this is in 1940s during World War, he took the laws of success and he wrote a new version, and he called the new version, Mental Dynamite. This is called Mental Dynamite, this is the whole book set that he wrote, they actually never launched, he finished writing this book set and they were starting to promote it, but because of the war there was an ink and a paper shorts that never actually got launched. But if you look at the titles of the book, it's kind of fascinating, like lesson number one, definite as a purpose, oh, that's law number one here, and that's also number one, it's the same framework, packaged in a different way, right? New book title, Mental Dynamite, New Hook, New Angle, New Stories, same framework. All right, then fast forward a little while later, Napoleon Hill met his business partner W. Cleven-Stones, who was a billionaire, a really cool guy, W. Cleven-Stones came to him and told Napoleon, I read The Inquiry, it changed my life forever, it was so cool, and we should become business partners, it became business partners, and then W. Cleven-Stones was like, there's actually, you're missing one of the laws, there's a law called PMA, Positive Mental Attitude, and so they wrote a book together called, Success Through Positive Mental Attitude, right? And this became the 17th law, and so eventually every book you were at this had 17 laws, and the 17th law was PMA, Positive Mental Attitude, and so this is kind of a cool way to look at that as well. This is the master keys to success with Napoleon and W. Cleven-Stones, guess what this is? This is them teaching the 17 laws of success through VHS and cassette programs, right? Same content, packaged in a different way. On top of that, Napoleon went and traveled the entire country, teaching these laws of success, doing seminars, events, all sorts of stuff, he was doing radio shows, teaching the same thing, in fact, one second, let me grab this. This is manuscripts from a radio show where Napoleon Hill, guess what he taught? Think and Grow Rich, right? Modular number one, this is the first radio show, talking about Deafness and Purpose. This is number two, talking about the mastermind, like radio show teaching the same content, packaged in a different way. I think I wanted to show you that I promise I'm gonna get to the point of this entire lesson. This is one of my favorites. So Napoleon and W. Cleven-Stones, they partnered up together, again, they had the book, they had all the other books, and they were selling a home study course, they made a home study course called the Science of Success, guess what lesson number one is? Lesson number one, Deafness and Purpose, same thing, right? They had a home study course, they had a teacher's edition, they started franchising, it's going around the world franchising, the science of success, same content, packaged in a different way, different stories, right? And they went and taught people on top of it. I wanna show you guys this because I think so many of us are overthinking this, like we're trying to do a million things, it's great framework, I have to framework, I have to framework, I have to framework. I started doing something very similar to my business, so I have a framework I teach called the Perfect Webinar, you may have heard of it before, people can go to perfectwebinarsecrets.com, you can buy the Perfect Webinar, just the PDF of the framework for like $7, it's the framework and you get some audio and some video of me teaching it, right? Then we have an upsell where there's a home study course for a couple hundred dollars, I teach the framework in a home study course version, right? And on top of that, we have a coaching program, we charge $10,000 for it, there's a virtual coaching program where we teach people over six weeks exactly how to build out of the Perfect Webinar. So I'm taking the exact same framework and I'm packaging it in a different way. There's a $7 version, there's a $300 version, there's a $10,000 version, same framework, packaged in different ways. So people spend more money, the same framework or content packaged in different ways. So I'm sharing this with you because you are a content creator, right? You've got books, courses, training, seminars, events, YouTube channel, whatever it is you're doing, you're creating all this sort of stuff anyway, if you keep trying to think of new thing, the new thing, the new thing, I want you to take a page from the Pauly Hills book, come back and say, what's the framework I teach? Create your outline, create your framework, the thing that you're gonna teach, the thing you have that changes people's lives and that's all you need. And then from there, you can package it in different ways. You can package it as a podcast, you can package it as an email newsletter, you can package it as a book, you can package it as a course, you can package it as a mastermind group, you can package it as a live event, you can package it as one-on-one coaching calls, you can package it as a YouTube channel, like package it on Instagram shorts, you can package it all sorts of different ways. And just understand that people spend more money with the same content packaged in different ways. One last example and then I'm gonna let you go back to work, focusing on taking your content and packaging different ways. I think about the very first book I ever wrote is called Dotcom Secrets, right? It was everything I'd spend a year of my life figuring out and learning about how to build funnels and how to drive traffic, all sorts of stuff, right? So I wrote this book, Dotcom Secrets. Now prior to me writing that, I was on the road doing seminars, speaking, month in and month out for five or six years and I was burned out of doing that. So I was like, I'm writing the book, so I can stop teaching this and I can just give people the book, right? So I wrote the book and it's amazing. But right now you can buy the book for basically shipping costs, like $10 shipping and handling, right? You can go to Amazon and buy for 20 bucks, right? That was the book. And the book taught everything about funnels. What was cool is that after that, then we created a home study course called the Funnel Hacking Secrets, which is the $1000 home study course which teaches people how to do everything from inside the book. Shortly after that, we launched a membership site called Funnel University, which was a membership site where every single month I would find two different funnels and I would funnel hack them. I'd go through and record myself buying the product, showing behind the scenes what they were doing, how they're doing, and that became a 97-month continuity program. Then my business partner, Todd Dickerson, and I, we created software that would build funnels, the framework to the dotcomsecrets book, and that was software that people could use to build actual funnels, right, based on the frameworks I taught. After that, we launched a live event called Funnel Hacking Live, and Funnel Hacking Live, where multiple speakers come in, each teaching the frameworks of my book. If you ever look at, like, the outline for Funnel Hacking Live, you'll notice that each of the speakers is talking about a different chapter from the dotcomsecrets book. That's it, there's the big secret, right? From that, then we have a coaching program called Two Common Club X. We also have a coaching program called Primeover Coaching Program, and in those coaching programs, we teach people the principles from the dotcomsecrets book. And after someone has success in the coaching program, they send them up to my inner circle, and inside the inner circle, we do mastermind groups based on the content from the dotcomsecrets book. Same content, packaged in a different way. You may think, why does someone spend $10 on a book, Russell, and $50,000 on a mastermind? It's the same thing. It's like, because it's packaged in a different way. You experience it different. One, you're reading a book. One, you're doing a home study course. One, you're using software. One, you're in a live event with a lot of people, and engagement. One, you're a smaller coaching program, virtually. One, you're in a mastermind group network with other people, like, it's the same content, packaged in a different way. So that's the lesson I want to share with you guys. I hope that you have value from this. When you start thinking about the frameworks and the content you already have, you're probably trying too hard to become more prolific and figure out more things. But do Napoleon Hill then. Figure out your framework, stick to them, and everything just doubles down and gets better and better and better. Teaching different audiences, different people, different segments of the market, same frameworks, packaged in a different way. I hope that helps you guys. Napoleon Hill has inspired me to give this late night here after hours. We're learning from the man right here. Suddenly sold 100 million copies of his book, you know, written more stuff on his core framework, sending any other author of all time. So prolific because he loved his frameworks. He loved the law of success. He didn't want to change it. He just wanted to keep giving access to his frameworks to different people, different segments. It was pretty powerful. So, see you guys from the exact same thing. I hope you enjoyed this lesson. If you did, let me know down below the biggest aha you got. Hopefully you had a couple of haus from, like, different ways to package your information. Hopefully you had some haus about different ways to charge more free information. Because if you do that, it's gonna change everything for you. So let me know down in the comments down below. I appreciate you guys, and I'll see you guys on the next video.
