Welcome to the vault. Today I've got a brand new old book you are going to love. This one I got for still is only $75 because nobody has ever heard of it, doesn't even know the value of it. It's called The Subconscious Mind in Business. It was written by the same author who wrote a book that is famous called Obvious Adams, which maybe we'll review in another video. But this is like a lost gem. A lot of times you find an author who wrote a book they ever know about and then they have these other ones that no one's heard of. I never heard of this one and I read it and it literally is one of my favorites. I think I've got about a half dozen books in this author row. But this one is fascinating because when I did a whole event, three event called Selling a Line where we teach people how to do subconscious selling, which is speaking to somebody's subconscious mind to sell them something. My new book is like using subconscious mind to sell yourself on your ideas and your goals. And then this book's kind of in between where it's like literally subconscious mind and business. So I got it and I instantly read it because I was like, this is my type of book. It's a short book, it's a fast read, but there were some gems in here that actually shift from my perspective on how I structure my work days. So it's a really good one. Especially in the business where a lot of people don't want to learn about mindset for some reason. I had this conversation with Tony Robbins. It was after our second funnel hacking live and I had a chance to have a conversation with him. And I was like, hey, we have this event called funnel hacking live. We have thousands of people from around the world come here and I'm like blows my mind. We get, you know, a percentage of people have success and I don't understand it. It's like I'm giving him everything. I give him my frameworks, my funnels, the best of I have. And I give it all to him. And Tony got a little smile on me. He's like, oh, you could tell that he'd already solved this problem like two decades ago. And he's like, you still think that someone's success is not based on the tactics, right? I'm like, yeah, that's why I have the best tactics in the world. He's like, yeah, you have to understand that success is like 10% tactics and 90% psychology. He's like, it's the things between their ears, their brain. He's like, people don't want to hear that though. So usually you have to like sell them what they want, which is how to make money or how to whatever you think, but then you give them what they need, which is help reframe their mindset. So I remember after I had that conversation that's when I asked him, like, would you come to funnel hacking live then and do the whole psychology thing of my people? Because I need them to be successful. Like I'm killing myself, giving them everything I have and I need more success. And so Tony spoke at our third funnel hacking live and he kept speaking at five of the 10 funnel hacking lives and he would always focus for three or four, one time you went for like six or seven hours on psychology. And so psychology is interesting. And I've noticed a lot, especially business owners and entrepreneurs, they don't want to focus on. They don't think it's what they need. They think it's like, I just need the tactic. I just need the strategy. If I get those things figured out, but the reality is, and this is me doing this now for two and a half decades, I've been in this business 25 years. I've coached literally hundreds of thousands, not millions of entrepreneurs at this point. It's not that they're smarter or better looking or faster or like have more money. It literally is the ones who understand how to control their mindset are the ones who win. And I saw it's initially in athletics. Right. I grew up as a wrestler during practice. I would lose these guys. They were better wrestlers than me. We went to tournaments and we step on the mat and they would lose to people they shouldn't lose to. In fact, I wanted my closest friends. I can never beat him in the wrestling room, like every single time. Same way class. So he was varsity that year. I was JV. I could not beat him and then went to a tournament and in the tournament, we were on opposite of brackets and we started going through. There was a guy that he lost to. He lost to him by like, it wasn't even close. We lost to my 10 points. Right. I just let the same guy and I tech fall them, which tech fall means I scored 15 points more than the other guys. So they stopped the match early. And I was like, how did you lose to like it's so fascinating to me. And so like you look at head to head, skill by skill, muscle, strength, all the things like he was better than me when it mattered. I want what's the difference. Right. I literally use your psychology. It's your brain. Like, and nobody focuses on that. We want to focus on putting in the reps and running and all those kinds of things, which are great. We won't focus on the thing that actually matters the most and same thing happens in business. So what typically happens is I try to trick people into like coming to our world, teach how to build a funnel, which they need to know how to do. But that is so simple. Like I can build a funnel in an hour. Right. The rest of the time, like while they're doing that, I've got to fix their mindset. I got to break the false beliefs. If I can get them on the right path, then they can be successful. And so it's again, it's one of those things that unfortunately people won't spend enough time talking about. Like when you do focus on that, it's the only thing that actually matters. I'm doing this now 25 years. There were different times where I would peek out in my success. Right. And every time you hit a plateau with something, there's some belief you have that's holding you back. Right. Cause the person's making a hundred thousand dollars a year versus a million versus 10 versus a hundred. They're probably not working different. They're probably not smarter. It's like there's beliefs they have internally. And so for me initially, I think one of the first plateaus I hit in my business was like the six figure mark because in my mind, I remember my dad made six figures a year and my dad was wealthy in our neighbor. I was just like, I was like, that's a lot of money. And so in fact, I remember I was hustling, I was doing all sorts of stuff. I was selling things. I was having some success and I'm on a call with somebody who's doing an interview with me on a tele-seminar before podcasts were even invented. And he asked me like, so I'm great. It might be six figures so far in your business. I was like, no, like that's not even possible. And that's what I was thinking. I was like, actually I have no idea. So I went back and I started looking at my bank accounts, my PayPal accounts and different places. Money was coming in my checks and I added it all up and I had done over a hundred thousand dollars at that point. I was like, I had no idea. And in my head, that was such a big number. I was just like, because that's what my dad made. And so for me to go from a hundred thousand a million was the first like gap that was really difficult because it was like my dad was successful. And so he made and so to make beyond that was just like, I don't know, it didn't seem real or possible. And that was hard for me. So what happened about that time in my careers when I started going to events and I started meeting other people, these were people who already broke in the million dollar mark and I started being around and start talking to my starts to happen. Phone calls with them and just like trying to surround myself with that because that seems so far for me. And then being around people who actually hit it all of a sudden, like the more time I spend is like, oh, this is actually possible. I can actually do this. It took me a couple of years before I broke the million dollar year mark. I remember breaking it. I was just like, oh, this is awesome. And then the next thing, because the next 10 million, like I didn't want to make $10 million. It was not something that was even something like a fathom or it was even possible. In fact, I remember I did a podcast episode saying, you guys being idiot want to make $10 million a year. My head was like, that's the dumbest thing in the world. Why would you ever want to do that? Right. And I had these false beliefs. It was selfish. It was greedy. It was wrong. Like whatever those things might be. Right. So my first plateau is like, I can't make more of my dad. Next plateau is like a million dollars is like the scary number. Right. And the next after that was just like, why would I need that kind of make? What was the purpose? You know, like it didn't seem like something that was of value. And so for me, like there's always these different belief patterns. A lot of times you don't realize what they are until you figure out how to break them or you're looking back or you find someone who already has. And you're like, man, this person does not have those beliefs that I do. I think I've done four or five interventions with Tony where I bring him a question. He like does this Tony magic and like changes my brain as after click, for all this past a hundred million dollars a year and I was stuck. And I was like, I don't know how to get to the next level. I can't figure it out. And he's like, well, who are the people you're spending time with? I was telling him. He's like, well, cool. Those are all people that have gotten businesses to your level. The thinking that got you there will not get you to the next level. He's like proximity is power. Like you're in proximity. Those people got you to that level. But those people are that level. He's like, if you want to get the next level, you have to get in proximity with people to the next level. And that's how you're going to get because it's going to shift your beliefs, your mindset, your subconscious mind and that'll get you to the next level. That was just a fascinating breakthrough for me. Cause I thought, you know, like, is there a level beyond this? And that's how you find it. And that's how you figure out what beliefs are holding you back. So the interesting thing about this book that's different than like a traditional book about subconscious is he's trying to show how your subconscious mind can bring out the creativity you need, right? A lot of times how many of us go and we have a problem they're trying to fix, right? And so you're doing meetings, you're reading books, I try to solve this problem, try to solve this problem. You can't figure out the problem. And then this is what happened to you where you're in the shower not thinking about it, you're showering all of a sudden like the idea pops in your, like it just shows up magically, right? Like that's what this book's talking about. How do you create those moments a little while ago in the office? We're saying that we have like eight of us in the, in the, the bowl pit talking about some try to solve this problem, try to solve this problem. And it was like an hour and a half, two hours on it without coming to any, like none of us got an idea. And after about two hours, I'd been drinking way too many updates and you know, drinks and stuff. I was like, I don't go to the bathroom. So I went to the bathroom. I'm literally gone. Maybe a minute. I disconnect my conscious mind. So I'm like, okay, I'm going to the bathroom and instantly the idea just pops up, right? This is what his book talks so much about is, is learning how to use a subconscious mind. In fact, I'm on page 13 here. He's talking about business people, entrepreneurs sitting at desks. He says desks are not thinking machines. In fact, they are with the paper and the clutter on them. They're apt to be distractions rather than to help us to actually think. They are the one place where men get so close to his business, they can get no perspective on it. So he talks about here as he starts talking about creating what's called, he calls the six hour workday. You know, kind of like Tim Ferriss's four hour work week, he says six hour work days, like for six hours you're in there. And you're able to work consciously. Like you're trying to figure out problems, you're solving stuff. He said the last two hours of the day, well, he found all the businesses that he coached on this last two hours of the day, they would stop doing like active work and then they would try to like engage their subconscious mind. I need creativity. I need ideas. You don't do that by sitting at your desk working, working, working. You do that by disengaging for most of these, like to sit down last two hours a day from three to five, they're reading a book, they're talking to the coworkers, they're walking. One of the stories in here talks about Henry Ford. We said Henry Ford, who obviously one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all time, he said that he didn't ever sit at his desk. He would walk back and forth and back and forth. And he said, that's how he became so successful because he's never sitting here consciously doing work. He was spending time on the things he loved the most thinking about. And then like the ideas would just kind of would pop up to the surface. And so that's what is one of the coolest things this book talks about. As you guys know, I am a workaholic. I love working. I love sitting at my desk, writing, reading. Like my days are jam packed with a whole bunch of stuff. They have been for a decade plus. Since we launched ClickFunnels, I have not stopped moving. Like just keeps going and going. As you probably know, about a month and a half ago I was at a wrestling tournament and I detached both my biceps. Literally God's like basically took me and put me on the sidelines. Like Russell, you cannot work for a little bit. So I lost this arm first. I got the surgeon's arm. I could not type. So I had one hand, so I'm typing one hand as fast as I can, you know, still trying to get everything done. And then on two weeks later, I got this one done and all of a sudden I'm in double cast. I cannot type. And so I'm stuck there. And you know, if we had an event, so I was on stage in an event with double cast, I couldn't talk. Earlier they taught Dickerson, who's my business partner, ClickFunnels. Todd brought to me into our entire team, like basically some big issues we were dealing with and struggling with, right? We sat there for like two hours trying to figure out how do we solve this problem? And same thing, like we're going around. Everyone's putting ideas in like, we left the meeting uneasy because I know knew the answer and it's like, you have to solve this problem. Where else there's going to be bad things that happen, right? Like you're at the layoff team members again. Like it was one of those kind of problems. And remember going home that night and I was tired. It had been a long day. I had no arms. So I was frustrated. And normally what I would do is I would like, you know, have someone turn on YouTube and I would try to like sedate myself and numb my brain. But for some reason I didn't want to. My wife left to his church activity. So I was home alone for a little bit. And so I remember sitting down there. I'm sitting on the couch. I'm just going to think until the answer shows up. So I sat on the couch. I was kind of daydreaming and thinking and stuff. And within 15 minutes, all of a sudden, like, boom, inside it popped my head. I was like, Oh my gosh, I think it solves the problem. I'm looking from this angle and this angle, every single angle. I was like, this solves the problem. Like within 15 minutes, it just showed up when I disconnected from me working and doing stuff. And I was telling someone later, I was like, I feel like God literally like, stop working, put me on the sidelines and like, let me like push something in your subconscious mind. So he literally put on my sidelines so I couldn't do anything. And also, like all of that is start coming. And so four week period time, right? Couldn't not use my arms doing literally what talks about in this book, like shifting from, you know, the 10 hour workday that Russell's normally doing. Even I could even do a six hour workday that he talks about recommends this book. I was literally doing like a one or two hour workday. And the rest of the time, like I could just think or walk or, you know, whatever. And that's when these ideas started bubbling up. And so it's pretty powerful when you understand, like that's how your subconscious brain works. Cause if you can't find the answer consciously, your conscious mind can only find things through your five senses, right? So if you can't see it, taste it, touch it, smell it or feel it. If you can't get the data from there, like it can't. Find the answer. If you can't find it from one of those five senses, you need to stick back and let your subconscious mind bring it to you. Then when you understand that, that's the main principle of this book. That's how you start getting more creative in business. All these ideas will start bubbling. Now, this book obviously talks a lot about using your subconscious mind for creativity. But the other thing to understand is your subconscious mind. It's the belief patterns you have. Yes, it will give you ideas and those things will bubble up when you take the time to break away. But also like your subconscious mind, your subconscious beliefs are the level you're at. I remember Tony Robbins when I talked about how your subconscious beliefs are and your identity, you're kind of like a thermostat, right? Where if your thermostat set at 72, you may get a little above 72 or below, but like it snaps back up, right? It's above like the air condition comes on, snaps back down. You go down below and the heater snaps back. But like that's like your floor, your subconscious floor, right? It's a lot of us like we have these beliefs and this is our subconscious floor, right? And we have desire to raise the temperature, to raise the heat to 90 or 100 degrees where we want to be at, right? And so we had, we set that conscious decision. I'm going to do the thing, right? What happens is it goes up a little bit and then your subconscious is like, nope, it snaps you back down to where it believes you belong, right? To that level. And so we, all of us, we have these subconscious floors, these beliefs that we have. And so if you ever felt stuck, like that's the reason why. So understanding your subconscious mind, how to figure, okay, where's the beliefs that I'm at? How do I break those beliefs and set a new temperature, right? A new level. Like that's the key to start moving up and actually having more success than you are today. You want to get a copy of this book. They are hard to find. First editions, there's some reprints on Amazon that are okay, but I got my notes for this. So if you want to see my notes on this book, going chapter by chapter, sharing the best quotes, the best ideas, examples and case studies and how you as a funnel hacker, you as a marketer can actually implement these things inside of your busy work days down in the comments and description. We will have a link to the notes. We can get notes for the subconscious mind in business. This book is awesome. It's powerful to quick read, but it's something that'll help increase your creativity and help you to break through whatever sticking point you're at and get to the next level.
