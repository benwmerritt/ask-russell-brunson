Hey, for those who are just tuning in, my name is Russell Brunson and today I'm gonna be answering a whole bunch of different questions on marketing and sales and growing your company and funnels and traffic and making money and a whole bunch of stuff in between. But today's question is one of my favorites. In fact, it might cause a little bit of a rant. So the question is websites versus funnels. And the question says so, maybe I'm crazy but I don't see a difference between a website and a sales funnel. Why do I need a sales funnel? Oh, thank you for asking that question. All right, so I'm gonna try to do a little of this kind of fast so you guys don't miss any of it. So this is a traditional website, okay? You come right here, you got your website. I'm sure you guys have seen these a billion times. Website. At the top, you've got your logo. And then there's like a navigation menu and there's a secondary menu. Then right here that they click on any of these it drops down to sub menu where there's like 20 different options. You click here, there's like 20 more options. And then there's like a section here and a section here and a section here and a section here. And then at every section they click, takes them somewhere else and then it takes them to the secondary page and the third page and they're on page like 92. There's like a place where we ask for money, right? I'll make it green. This is where we finally ask for money, okay? That's a traditional website. Okay, and what does that look like to you? Okay, let's say you go and you give Mr. Zuckerberg some money on Facebook. He drives a whole bunch of people here. It's literally like, let's say you had a store, okay? And in front of the store you had a whole bunch of people blocking people from coming into the front door. You're like, uh-uh, wait, wait, hold on. Do you want to know about us? Wait, do you want to contact us? Wait, do you want to know about my product page? Wait, do you want to know about my product page? Wait, do you want to see it? And you're like blocking them with all these links and they're coming here to get to the link right here. Let's say this is like the money link where they're gonna give you money to get to this page right here, okay? But they gotta pass one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20. There's like 20 or 30 things they have to navigate around to get to the spot where you actually want to, they actually do something to give you money or to become a lead or whatever it is. That is your traditional website. They drive me nuts, so right? There's either that or the other variation is like, so if you look at these in the rural, right? So one of them is like, here's your store from and you've got like armed guards out front blocking people from coming through the door, right? So there's your website. That's a lot of you guys are doing if you got a traditional website. You're like, don't come in, please, I want to confuse you. The number one rule of direct response marketing is, a confused mind will always say no. So you are blocking them and confusing them and they're like, I don't know what to do and then they just leave. Or the second option is you do more like a traditional e-commerce store or Amazon, right? And you don't have these guys blocking them, but you're like, welcome to my store and they walk in, there's a billion things and they walk in and they're like, I don't know what to do. Have you guys ever walked in a library? Like I want to learn how to time my shoe. You walk in a library and there's like eight levels, like 800 books, you're just like, I don't know what to do and you walk out, right? I'm sure the answer is somewhere in there. I just don't know what it is, okay? That's what most people are doing with the website. They're blocking everything, okay? So now take that, let's shift that to a funnel. So what is a funnel? Here is a funnel. So a funnel is like, imagine this person, right? Here's the dude right here coming to your world. He comes into your store. Instead of blocking him or ignoring him, you meet him at the front door, you're like, hey, what's your name? Oh, my name is Russell. Oh, Russell, great to meet you. So hey, I want to make sure you're the best experienced possible. So step number one, what are you actually looking for? I'm like, oh, I'm going on a camping trip this weekend. I'm like, cool. So what do you want? I'm like, I'm actually looking for a tent. He's like, oh, you want a tent? And the guy grabs me over here and takes me over to the tents. He's like, here is the tent section, Russell. I'm like, oh, sweet, the tent is awesome. Thank you so much for the tent. And they're like, what else do you need on this trip you're going on? I'm like, well, I'm gonna go backpack with my kids. Like, well, do you have a backpack? No, like, oh, well, you should get a backpack. And the dude walks me over here and I get a backpack. And he takes me through a customized sales process specifically for me. That's what a funnel is, right? When I drive somebody from Facebook and they come to a page, page number one is a very simple, like, usually there's one thing, right? Confused mind always says no. So I'm there, I'm saying, hey, welcome to my landing page. So what do you want from, you know, if you go to, in fact, if you go to clickfunnels.com right now, you'll notice it's like, hey, a lot of people use click funnels. Tell me what kind of business you're in and I'll tell you exactly what type of funnel you need, right? And so I have this like survey here. They tell me exactly what kind of funnel I have. And then based on that, I have 10 different pages I take them to, okay? Just like at this dude, if I walked in, I was like, hey, I run a retail location, how do I use funnels? He wouldn't walk me over to some other weird section. He'd take me exactly where it is, right? So page one of funnels is very simple. I ask who they are, what they want. I take them specifically to a page that gets them exactly what they want, right? And then from there, I take them to the next page and I'm able to walk them through a very simple sales process where it's, they only see one thing at a time. I take them through this process and what happens is two things. Number one, this customer that you just paid for to get to your website or to your funnel, okay? Because he now has a customized experience, he ends up being really happy, like a lot happier, right? He's like, wow, these guys treated me really, really well. They didn't just like slam me into a brick wall and hope I could figure my way out. They didn't block me and confuse me. They took me through a very systematic sales process I understood exactly what I was doing. So your customer becomes really happy. The second thing is you as the shop owner, you come down here, you become more happy because guess what happens? They end up paying you more money. So what happens is the customer has a better experience. You as the owner of the funnel makes more money so you have a better experience, both people win. And my definition of business is when both people leave feeling like they got a better deal, okay? And that's what a funnel is. And so if you hate your customers, you should definitely keep using a website. Keep blocking them, confusing them and make sure they don't know what to do. Or if you wanna like change their lives, they can build a funnel and take them through a systematic sales process to get exactly what they want to the best experience possible and you make the most money possible from every single person. So there you go, that's the difference between a website and a funnel. I hope you guys like that rant. Thank you so much for watching. Every single week we publish new secrets just like this.
