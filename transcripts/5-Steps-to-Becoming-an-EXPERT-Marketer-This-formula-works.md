So after you've done phase number three, you test it on yourself like, oh my gosh, this actually works. I built the funnel, I had success with it. Now you're gonna start selling it, right? No. The man, Russell. Pay to sell your product. I love this guy. I love this guy. I honestly believe the entrepreneurs are the only people that can actually change this planet. This is pajama night at Russell's Midnight Event. So this is the second Midnight Match of Mine, a board of cruise ship that we've ever done. So we want to welcome you guys. I've previewed the presentation. It's gonna be awesome. You guys, I want to hear a huge, huge, huge, huge round of applause for Mr. Russell Brunson. You guys are here. Alright, thank you, thank you. I'm really excited for this. This is something I've been secretly geeking out on by myself in a little closet while I'm writing. What I want to talk about is funnel frameworks. Before we get to like the actual, how do you create a framework? As I started going through this expert secrets thing, I saw people who started using all these principles and just started using them. They started, you know, they read the book, they're like, sweet, I'm an expert and they started trying to sell stuff. And it was like, well, you know, just because you read the book doesn't mean you're actually an expert. Like there's a process you have to go through. And so when I was writing the new version of the book, I started really geeking out on it and thinking deep. Like what is the process? Like how did I get to the spot where I am right now? I think too much in our community, in other communities, there's people who say they're an expert and start selling things and they're really good at getting money, but not so good at actually fulfilling and giving an amazing process. So I want to spend more time tonight at Funalhacking Live throughout our, within our entire community, like focusing on this part of it, because I think it's so essential and so, so important. Okay, so the five phases for becoming an expert. I'm going to go deep into each of these, but this is the framework of how to become an expert. Okay. So space number one is what we call the dreamer. It all starts with a spark. Okay. You think about anything in your life. When you first get started on something, it's just kind of you and your normal, you have a normal life, right? How many of you guys can remember back in time when it was just you and you were like a normal human being, right? And you weren't like obsessively passionate and obsessed with whatever the thing is that you're obsessed with, right? And life was probably easier at some points. You could sleep at night. You could like wake up whenever you wanted. You could go hang out. It was just easy. You could talk to friends and family members. It was just like conversation was easy. And then like, all of a sudden you got the spark, right? And something was exciting. Okay. And this is where most things start. Phase number two. So now you got the spark and you're excited. The biggest thing I want to do is I want to take the spark. I want to grow as fast as I can. I don't know about you, but I feel like my main job and my main role at ClickFunnels is to be the guy who's so excited about this. If anyone bumps into me, they're like, they're a little spark. We'll catch on fire too. And I'll say, I want to build funnels too. And like yesterday you were dentist. Now you want to build funnels because you had a little spark and you bumped into me. I caught you on fire, right? In phase number one, I'm excited. I'm going down this path. I'm learning. I'm geeking out. I'm studying. I'm starting to learn a bunch of stuff, right? Phase number two now is I'm looking who are the other people and I'm going to take on the role of the reporter. Okay. And the main reasons because I need to go and get around a whole bunch of people who already have the fire, the fire. Okay. That's the second phase in this process where I got started. It was the same thing. I started to learn this whole business. And the first thing I did is I started interviewing people. Okay. So the goal is as you got the spark is to take on the role of reporter. Okay. And do the equivalent of reading 30 books on the topic. Okay. But instead of reading, if you want to shortcut the process is finding those people who are already experts who already have the burning flame and burning desire and start interviewing those people to get the information from all of them. Cause what's going to happen is if you start selling your thing based on your expertise, again, you're going to be very one sided. If you go through the second phase of growth first, your interview in 10, 20, 30, 40 other people and get the, get a more holistic picture. You're going to be better actually. You're going to be able to sell to serve your people at such a higher level. Does that make sense? The next step in this process is for us to go and create what I call a framework hypothesis. A lot of times when we start testing things out, we find it really quickly that we're wrong. How many of you have ever done before you start testing like, oh, like that actually was way off. Turns out I can't be ketogenic diet and the ice cream. Like it doesn't actually work. Dang it. That seemed like such a good idea. Okay. Let me try something else. We tried again. We tried again. We tried again. We tried again. Until we're able to get the result for ourselves first, we have to become human guinea pigs. Okay. So for all of us, like we need to be the human guinea pig of our process of our framework. If it doesn't work on us, there's no way to work on anybody else. And that gives you ability to fail before you're testing on somebody else. Last thing you want to do is fail when you're trying to help somebody else. Right. You want to make sure the process is least worked for you first before you go and help somebody else. That makes sense. Man, the dress is awful. This is a dance, man. If you can get the best pajamas. What is this? Okay. Have you ever seen a cigar or something like that? I don't know. A hat or something? Shawn's got loose pants and flannels. Patrick wins the first ever Clip Funnels Pajama Party Contest. First ever. Okay. Now I'm ready for a jammy party. After you have created your framework hypothesis, the second step is you gotta have a sexy name for it, right? If you say, here's my, if it's just like my framework to be happier, that's not as good as like you need a tangible name for it, right? How many guys know the name of this framework? I'm going to start drawing it. As soon as you know what I'm drawing, yell it out. Boom. Perfect webinar framework, right? That's my name. I trademarked it. You have to have names that you can bring up, right? Like these are frameworks I've developed. I've used over and over and over again so much so we're like, if you see a picture, you know it instantly, right? So after you've done phase number three, you tested on yourself like, oh my gosh, this actually works. I built the funnel. I had success with it. This is amazing. I want to share this message with the world. Now you're going to start selling it, right? No. Okay. Some people start selling it the second that they like, I'm an expert. Give me money. Some people like build a framework and then they start selling it without testing it. Okay. We're better than that though, right? We figured out we test ourselves. We have success with it now. It's like now we find other people. I know it works for me, but maybe I'm an abnormally, maybe I'm like the, the, the weird statistic doesn't fit. I didn't make sure this actually works for other people to not just myself. So let me go and test this process and other people, right? So this is where we start finding some of our, our, our future dream clients. We start working them for, working with them for free. This is a step that so many people miss. Me talking about awesome. I will sell it to some people, but if you want to grow a company beyond just yourself and build a big company, it's other people's success stories that grow it. Three or four years ago, I stopped talking about my own success. I don't talk about it. I don't show you guys how many two common cup awards we, that I win. What stories do I tell? Everybody else's now that you've done that now we move to step number five and now you have a taste to become an expert. You move from having this spark to lighting it on fire, creating your hypothesis. You're testing it on yourself. You're figuring out, you get results with yourself. Keep testing and tweaking until it's perfect. Actually works for yourself. And you take those frameworks test with other people. Now you can go out there and say, look, I'm an expert. I know what I'm doing. And now you've got, now you've got a process. So that right there, you guys is the five step process of becoming an expert. This is the framework from going from growth to contribution. Thank you. Give me a clap. Yeah. I'll take that.
