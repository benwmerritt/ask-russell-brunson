But you don't tell him the day out. It'll destroy your marriage more than anything. Am I going to jail? It's like hiding in the bathroom. Nobody sees like, I'll be like, what is this? If Mark Benioff offered you a billion dollars for ClickFunnels, what would you say? My question for you before you get to the part about sacrifice, like, you know, to be Russell Brunson, right? To lead what you're leading and do what you're doing, writing the books, creating what you're creating, you know, the creativity, the constant, like, making sure that the ClickFunnels community stays fresh. What's the sacrifice that comes with that? That hurts, man. That's tough. That's heavy. There's a lot. It's interesting because I think most people see the positive. Like, people are like, oh, should I click fun? That'd be a cool thing. And it's like, yeah, but it's crazy because like as we've grown, like, man, there have been so many times where on the journey where each tier as we get bigger, there's like more attacks that come from outside, from the inside, some things like that, right? Like, in legal attacks, we have just a lot of stuff you don't think about that you have to start dealing with, right? And the bigger gets the more intensity that comes with that and like the more the more exposure and the more things that keep happening. And so like there are, I mean, tons of sleep that's nice. I told you two and a half, three years ago, we hired, you know, more lawyers are going through our stuff and looking at all the things. And now we have legal in-house counsel because like for us, it's like not only are we like our own marketing, we have our affiliates who are marketing and then we've got 120,000 customers who are marketing. And so like, it's like two or three years when the first time we got a lawsuit was from Taylor Swift. And I was like, we got a later from Taylor Swift lawyers. I'm like, what's going on? I'm opening up and it's like, you are being sued by Taylor Swift. I'm like, what's happening? Yeah. I'm like, what did I do to Taylor Swift? I'm freaking out. Like, I don't even know what's happening. And took us a while to figure out. It's like, oh, some bozo who's using our platform is like illegally selling Taylor Swift stuff. What it looks like is click funds because it's on our servers and our students. So like, you know, so I'm freaking out. And then later we get like letters from the FBI. Like, you know, and they come in certified mail. And it's like, Mr. Brunson, like, yeah, like signs paper, like you've been served, right? I'm like, I'm getting a letter from like certified an FBI. I'm like, am I going to jail? You know, like, hiding in the bathrooms. Nobody sees like, I'll be like, what is this? And it's like, oh, some more on our platform is doing something stupid. And because they think it's us, it's like, oh, like those things happen all the time. Or just people who are taking shots at us. We had one guy we helped be super successful. Comes in and click from those groups, shows proof and stats of how much money is made, all this stuff through our thing. Huge testimony. I'm like, do we change this guy's life? This is amazing. Took a screenshot of it. Our team sees the screenshot. Like, oh, this is cool. Like in our, in our folder, like success stories, grabs a screenshot, runs it's an ad. Dude sues us for sharing, for sharing a screenshot of his success story in our thing and upsetting for tens of thousands of dollars. Like, and that is the head of the one. That's happened insane amounts of times. We're now it's like, it's just the bigger you get. Like, again, people who you've helped attack you. People like you have employees who leave who now compete against you. Friends. Um, one of my closest friends who like, like literally was down and out, needed money, wrote him a check for a hundred grand, like, like help him survive his life. Like two years later, launches a competitor against us, talking trash about me. I was like, you were broke two years ago. I wrote you a check mail pocket for you to survive as a friend. And now you're like on Facebook talking trash about me. It's just like, yeah, that's the part people don't see. And it's just like happening. Oh, right. Just it's just like, some days you're just like, why? Like, oh, like, anyway, one of my favorite books, there's a book called Atlas shrugged and I won't go deep into it because it's the greatest book of all time. But the principle of it is in the book, there's all these producers, right? The people that are moving the world, people like Atlas holding the way the world on their shoulders, right? And what happens when the weight gets so heavy or things are so bad, the Atlas stops carrying any shrugs, like screw it, I'm out and walks away. Not only me, but I feel like the people that I serve entrepreneurs are the producers. Like we're the people holding the weight of the world on our shoulders. And it's like, I feel like we're getting attacked from government, from people, from policies, from every side we're getting attacked on in the book. That's the whole premises book is like, what happens when that comes in? I don't want it to come to that. Like that's not my goal to shrug and us all walk away. But I want to remember that. Like we got to be careful because in the book, some of the main characters, they don't get involved with, you talked about politics. They're not getting involved in these things, not doing stuff because like, oh, I'm just going to focus on my thing. I'm not going to worry about it. I think it's the point where it's so bad that they eventually all have to walk away. And so I want to make sure that doesn't happen. And it's kind of a reminder of that. Like how do we how do we produce, but also in a way that can sustain what we're doing? Right? Like, I love the world. I love the people. I love my life. I don't want those things to go away. So it's like, how do we how do we play this game in a way that's going to make it be here for the long term? So I don't know, just inspires me to think about that and making sure that we stay there. I've always wanted to ask someone, you know, if your stature that's done as much as you have impacted as much people as you have and really built the business that you have. So I'm curious on your take on leadership, building a team, delegating and your schedule and how you go about scheduling your day and prioritizing, you know, what's important for you and as a business owner and like what you delegate to your employees and their responsibilities as well. So leadership, delegating and like scheduling. A big part of it is is understanding, at least for me personally, like I was trying to be leader, trying to develop that. And like, but I wasn't like the best at it. I think sometimes we think we like it's always got to be us, you know, like it's my company, I've got to be the leader. I got to do things. It's like understanding that like a lot of times there's people who are really good. Like who's the best you can find to be that or any any part of our business, you know, I mean, is a big part of it. Second thing is if you've studied Dan Sullivan at all, one of his biggest things is unique ability, like his that's the thing. What's your unique ability? What's everybody's unique ability? And I think when you start a company, it's tough because it's like everyone's in charge of everything. Right. Like I'm the CEO, but I'm also like taking out the garbage. I'm also doing that. You know, everyone's doing a little bit of everything, which is cool. Like we're scrappy. The beginning is important and everyone's doing that. But as you grow, that starts hindering you more and more and more where we had, you know, people who are insanely talented. Like if I could just get them doing this thing a hundred percent of time, and that's what we got pointed with in click funnels is that like my unique abilities are writing are being in videos are building funnels do them are like those things are like my unique abilities. I was spending maybe 10% of my time on that and 90% of time in meetings and trying to report to people and leadership and it was stressful. You were draining. Are you probably drained? Yeah. And I was I was miserable. Like I was just like, like I wasn't good at like not feeling like, oh, like, I'm not getting through to people. I can't figure this out. But I felt like I had to own. I had to be the guy. I had to do the thing because like this is my baby. It's my business. And the last 12 months has been crazy because I handed someone who actually is good at it. It is unique ability. And I'm watching company structure and meetings and things that I was never super good at doing and consistently having all happening now. And now I'm in the marketing department again and I'm building funnels like people like, what do you do all day? I'm literally in click funnels building funnels. Like, no, but you have fun. Like, no, like I'm literally in click funnels building funnels. Like I didn't start this business. I want to be CEO of a big, huge company. I did it because I love building funnels. Like I'm an artist and it comes down to like, this is my art. Wow. And that's what you do now. How do you develop the additional tolerance to be able to continuously like level up and continuously deal with those new challenges? That's a good question. What came to my head is thinking when I first started the business was me, right? And so, but as I started growing the business, you started getting teammates and people and it starts growing. And now it's not, I think it's lighter for me because it's not just me either. It's, excuse me, it's an amazing group of people who I love and I respect who we're all fighting those things together now. That's made it so much easier for me. Where you see me, me sitting in my thoughts alone like, oh, we're now it's like, okay, I've got my team. I've got my, the people who, you know, who are in this with me, a hundred percent they're thick and thin and I send a message to them and like collectively together, it's like we take that and it makes it so much easier not have to fight alone. So I think that's a big part is like, getting a spot. We're not just fighting yourself. You're fighting together with people because yeah, I, there's been issues. And just in the last few months, I couldn't have handled myself. Like no matter how tough I think I am, I look at, you know, Dave and Todd and Dan and like the guys in my team are my close partners and stuff that because of them, like we're able to do stuff that's sometimes just ridiculous. We're like, this is crazy. This is. Yeah, man. Well, what is it that they do that has earned your trust as a leader, as somebody who I'm sure there's so many people that want to be in your inner circle, but how, how, how them, how did you know to trust them? Also Dan, Dan's on the camera right now. So Dan, like, came into my world like, like a week before the first phone lacking live, I saw some of his work. I was like, Oh my gosh, I sent an email like, dude, come from like, what am I doing? Like, just bring your magic. Do it. Like that thing you do, just do that. Like no direction, no instruction, no nothing. He comes in, comes to the event. I don't even seem the whole time. He's running around doing a million things. And then like a couple months later, he's like, here's the video from from like, you live and watch it. And I was like, I gave him no direction, no instruction, like nothing. And it came back and it was the greatest thing I've ever seen. Wow. And I was like, huh. And so then fast forward next year, it's like, do you want to do that? Again? Like, he's like, yeah, we don't want to different. I'm like, just do this. This same thing you did. Just do that again. Right. That's actually powerful. Yeah. And did that two or three times and then we got closer and closer and eventually became a partner and inside of click, funnels, brought him in as a full partner. And, but he's someone who like doesn't need direction, super creative, but he comes like all the time as a servant, like just here he serves, he gives, he like shows up, does more than you ask him. Like just talking about the extra mile he embodies that message or that is insane. Like every year, right? There's no way you can make it better. And then this year he sent the thing and I was like, it's better speechless. And we watched it like 20 times in a row. I've probably watched this year's, I'd say conservatively a hundred times. Every time I'm like getting tired, I just push play again. I'm like, all right, let's go. Yeah. For anybody watching this that is an employee rewind and really listen to how he talked about Dan, because that's what we all dream of. You know, I remember Kobe Bryant, he said, the number one thing he looks for when he's hiring is obsessives. Bridget, what was your question, buddy? Yeah. So you were talking about how each level of success that you hit, some of your mentors hit that ceiling, right? Cause the posturing, right? And so ultimately I feel like when you get to a new level of success, requires you to like upgrade your identity, right? Your self image. And so what have you found is the number one, like routine or what's your process for upgrading the identity, upgrading your self image? Cause I think that's so important cause it can either hold you back and help have you self sabotage and not take action and go after what you want. Or, you know, it's going to be the thing that keeps you at that level and continues to propel you forward. It's weave through everything. Like, and the, the one that's the most obvious external, especially in our world is cause you see business like marketers, like, um, like most people when they first start selling, whatever is they're selling, like they're bragging about themselves, right? Like, here's my abs, here's how much money I made. Here's like, it's, it's all about them. Like that's like the first tier of it. And then the second tier, like when they start having the realization, I feel like is when they stop talking about themselves and start talking about the people they've helped, you see externally, it's like, now it's no longer talking about, like, you don't hear me talking about what's money I make, but I talk about all the other people, right? It's like, that's the next year is that. And then, and then, um, for me, like the third tier now, which has been really cool is like talking about, like we talked about Ladyboss, right? Like, Kay, like it wasn't me, then it was Kaylin, but now like the success stories of Kaylin is Kaylin's customers, right? And so it's like that next tier of like, of what you're talking about is like the external version of that. So there's a lot of internal things that you got to deal with, but it's like you, you'll notice it shifting in people when you look at just their messaging, what they're saying from the way they podcast, the video, they, they market their ads and everything. It's like the shift of like, it's not about me, it's about them. And the same about them, it's about, like that's the external version of it. I had a, this really successful guy met one time who, um, the first time he was like, tell me your story. So I was telling them my, you know, the Russell posturing story about how great I was. And he's like, no, he's like, you know, tell me, tell me about like the time you failed. I was like, uh, he's like, no, like, so I was like, well, I'm in the middle one right now. So I told him, let me tell you, you know, so I told him this whole, like the whole thing. And I remember afterwards I was like, so embarrassed and just like, ah, he's going to become an idiot. Like just, you know, that, that fear is like, good, you cycled. I'm like, what? He's like, he's like, I will not work with entrepreneurs to have cycled at least once. He's like, because if they haven't, they still believe their own, their own bio, right? And I think that's the biggest thing is just like, is the internal version is that is like, is the first time around or whatever, before you cycled, you think it's all you like, I know for me, it was like, I remember doing this first time like, I'm a genius. I got in the smartest guy in the world. And then when it collapsed, I was like, oh, there's a lot of things outside of my control. This is not me. There's a team. There's God. There's all these other things that are making this possible. And there's a scripture. I can't remember where it says Bible Book of Mormon. It says like, you can either be humble or God will miss quoting it by far. But it's like, God will have a humble people here. You can be humble or you'll humble you. So it's like looking down. Okay. Round two, I'm going to be a humble person. I don't want to be humbled again. Right. So it's like, so it's like, this is not me. And that, and I understand that I look around now. It's like, there's no way I would be where I'm at right now if Dan Usher didn't make videos when he does. There's no way beer now. Now if Todd Dickerson could not code software the way that there's no way it could happen without that. Yeah. Two big things that I heard from you amongst your story, you were talking about this positivity, like when you, when you experience something or learn something you're so excited about it, you're so positive. But then there's this other part of you that's very vulnerable. And so you experience anxiety or you have challenging days or you're discouraged. How do you find the balance between those of being vulnerable and being honest with how you're feeling versus, Hey, this is a challenge. I'm an entrepreneur. I can overcome this. What's the balance? There's three or four things that I got from Tony the very first time I went to his event and I heard him speak that had a huge impact on me. One of the biggest ones was state control, like understanding that. If you're going to talk about the triad and things like that, like I had never heard that before. And I remember watching him do these things with people in the audience. And it was just like, it was fascinating. He took a, he took a lady from who was a, who was a suicide. Someone, he picked some of the odds who was suicidal. And he's like, it was the weirdest thing. And he talked about the triad, right? There's three, there's three things that change your state, right? There's, there's your language, there's your focus and there's your physiology. Right. So he takes someone, he's like, I'm somebody's suicidal. Takes beautiful girl. I remember in Warp in Toronto, this event, takes this girl and he's like, I need you to get depressed, like not, not like a little bit depressed, like clinically, like suicidal. She's like, why is like, get there in your mind, like whatever it takes, get dark. And you see her, like her, her state changed, right? And he's pushing her and keeps pushing her and gets her to this point. And anyway, it's crazy. I'm watching this and I'm kind of freaking out because I'm watching him do this to this girl, getting her point. And soon she's bawling her eyes out and everything. And he's like, you get deeper, get darker, more miserable, like all the stuff. And you see him change this girl's state. And all of a sudden I'll stop and I'll finally, it seemed like forever, finally stops. He's like, everyone look at her, watch her, like, look at this. It's like, what do you notice? What's her physiology? You see her body, you see tears and all this stuff. And you see her just broken. And he's like, what do you say? He goes through the whole tribe with her and he shows that. And he's like, now I'll show you how quickly we can shift this. To the point where it's like, anyway, it was crazy. And then he shifts it and he starts getting her, taking her back through it by shifting the physiology, shifting her shoulder, shifting her things, shifting her meanings, shifting the focus, shifting what she's saying. And he gets this girl within three or four minutes to literally like, ecstasy, like it was crazy watching this. And you see her where she's laughing and crying, like the opposite side of it. And I'd never seen somebody like the flip of emotions, how easy it was by just shifting these three things in her. And it had such a profound impact on me. If not maybe the one I saw, but he does it every UPW. I'm sure there's YouTube videos of as well. But if you type the triad, I think it's called the triad or state control, things like that, you see it happen. But I saw that I was like, oh my gosh, like I never realized that we had control over that. I thought my feelings were my feelings. Like, here's your feeling like, okay, crap, this is the feeling I have today. And like after experiencing that, I was like, I could actually change this. I didn't know that. And it's interesting because I think sometimes when we're depressed or sad, we have these things like, I think it's almost like it. Like I've had times before, like I don't want to be happy. Like I'm enjoying feeling miserable. And I sometimes I sit in there because I enjoy it because like we do. It's weird. It's messed up. But I feel them like this is, like I could change this, but I don't want to. But other times I'm like, I have to change. It's crazy. You can shift your state and you can do that and show up the way you need to be. Your feelings are weird that they're going to show up in one way or the other. And the fact that you can control, which I don't understand or know how, but sometimes I realize that it's just like, I don't have to be sad or miserable or anxious, whatever. I can actually change those things in a moment if I understand how. And that was like one of the greatest gifts Tony gave me was just understanding how to do that and seeing it in practical applications. Somebody announced like, I can do it myself anytime I need to, if I need to. I ask you a question outside of business. Yeah, you guys got a question? Yeah, I have a question. So you talked about, I remember you were talking about your wife earlier. Me and my fiance actually met at Club Funnels in your event. Yeah. So, Club Funnels wedding. Yeah. So what I'm curious about is... You're the best man of the wedding. I told you. I told you. I'm gonna be in Costa Rica soon. Nice. So what I want to ask you is, what is your secret to like a really successful marriage that's worked for you? I think that's something that many entrepreneurs have good marriages they don't really get asked about. So I was just curious about that. Throughout history and society, the way that most of us get things done is in any relationship, there's like, there's a power player and there's someone less, right? It's like, if I want my wife to do something, I'm gonna demand, I need you to do these things, right? And that works until the other person has the ability to leave. So prior to divorce being a thing, men throughout history have had a dominant relationship over women. They use demand relationship to get what they want. And women couldn't leave and so it was a horrible thing, right? But they couldn't leave. Soon as divorce happened, boom, it started happening, right? When parents come over to the kids and give demand relationship, as soon as the kids are able to leave, it breaks and breaks his relationships. And so that's the problem is that for the last 5,000 years, that's been our DNA that men force women to do these other things. And that's the demand relationship is. Their whole training, their whole course, everything they teach is the opposite of demand relationship. How do you create a relationship where transformation happens through inspiration, not through demanding and like, changing. So it's tough because for all of us, especially men, it's been so ingrained in our DNA that if we want something, it's how we do business, how we do things. Especially the intimate relationship, it's the worst thing that possibly happened to you. And then the other thing is, you have to understand what your values are. I learned from Tom Bill, you at a level that was fascinating recently. So it's figuring out for yourself what are your values personally with your family, with everything like that. And you define them and then it's like, there's no question. Like, that's what's hard is when you value something here and your spouse values something differently and the conflict of that is what causes the fights, right? But if you get on the same page like, look, this is number one, you have these things, then it makes it easier to navigate those things. It's like, no, I understand like this is one of the values we have is together with a couple, like you should go do that thing or whatever the thing that be. So like we were building click phones and stuff. It was it was hard at first because she didn't really understand. Like, she's like, what are you guys doing? You spent all this time and you understand it. And it was tough because I was trying to explain it. And there wasn't until the very first Funal Hockey Live where my wife had never been to one of my events before anything we'd really she knew what kind of we did, but not really. And she came to Funal Hockey Live, the very first one. And she didn't come out at first because she didn't realize what's happening. She was like, you know, doing some stuff. And then she came down with one of her friends and walked in the back of the room and saw the stuff and she started just crying. She's like, oh, this is this is what you're like. I had no idea this is what was happening and what was and they became real for and like that was such a huge blessing for me because now when next time is like we have to work hard for this or we're planning for whatever she's able to see. Like this is the fruits of my oh, that's what you're doing. And now if you notice my wife's every Funal Hockey Live front row, she doesn't understand a word we're saying, but she's there. She's paying attention because she's like, look at all these people and the lives are changing and impacting. Now it's it's different. We're like when I got to do work late nights or whatever, she sees the vision and she's on board with it. So it makes it so much easier. The other secret I learned is if I tell her if it's like five o'clock at night, I'm like, crap, I got so late tonight. I call it five o'clock at night. Nothing good can come from that. It's better for you just to like go home. Right. If I know it's like Wednesday night, I'm going to be working late. I tell her Monday, like, hey, Wednesday night, there's a good chance I'm going to be late. And then if I tell her, she's totally cool with it. Right. But you don't tell them the day up. It'll destroy your marriage more than anything. Let's go with the other secret. This this secret don't put on camera. I don't want my wife. I don't want my wife to. Is that right? Yeah. So we start having kids at the same time I start this business. Right. So I'm traveling and going to events and she's a home with the kids. And so we never travel before. So I'm going on these vacations. I'm meeting these cool people. I'm in hotel rooms. So if I'm getting back and I'm like, oh my gosh, I'm like, OK, I met so and so and then all these things I'm so excited. Like so like pumped about all the things I'm telling about stuff. And she's a home with twin babies. Miserable, tired, horrible, feet hurt, body hurt. You know, and I'm not having the time of my life. Yeah. And I'm thinking she's going to be pumped for me, right? No. And that for like, for like, probably a year or so. I was just like, and one day I remember I met some event and I get like cornered by people on an introvert to Russell's like anxiety and it was horrible. And somebody cornered in the bathroom and is like, it's asking me questions. I'm peeing. It wasn't even like most of the time they fake P next year. She's like, not awkward. You should next me like watching me pee. I'm like, you really think it was so bad. I got home that night and I call her on the phone and I was just like, it was horrible. I went off how horrible it was and all the miserable. And she's like, oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. And like, but then she was like cool. It was awesome. I was like, I didn't get in trouble. And so the next time I went out, I was like, I got home at night. Callers like, oh, it's horrible. My feet hurt. My back hurt. I was like, they want to hear the stories, not in the moment. Like later she wants to hear, but not in the moment because this is like anyway, so marriage is marriage is one of the hardest things. The one most like rewarding things at the same time. So it's worth it, but it's a it's a ride. Go through demand, relation, man. That's a great story. If Mark Benioff offered you a billion dollars for ClickFunnels, what would you say? I'd ask me for five. Ha ha! Five. Good response.
