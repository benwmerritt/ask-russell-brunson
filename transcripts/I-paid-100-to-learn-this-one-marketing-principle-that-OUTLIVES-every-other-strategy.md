There's a secret marketing hack buried inside this program from 2002. I'm an author who's no longer on this planet with us and nobody else remembers except for me. And today I'm going to show you the course, tell you the story behind this person, and I'll actually show you guys what the marketing hack is. And it's something that is still the number one focus of my business today after over 25 years of being in business. These are two of the greatest marketing minds in the history of all time. The pioneers in our industry. One is Dan Kennedy, who I talk about a lot. And number two is Corey Rudle. I'm curious, anyone who remembers Corey Rudle, let us know in the comments down below. But Corey was one of the original pioneers of internet marketing. Back 20 some odd years ago, I bought one of his original courses, teaching internet marketing. Almost everyone I know. In fact, I had an interview with Tai Lopez literally yesterday and he told me, yeah, I had this job. And also then I saw this ad for a Corey Rudle course and I bought it, show up these two big binders. I'm like, I have those exact same binders. Corey was the founder of the internet marketing industry. I hate that most people don't even know his name because he literally was the first person that took direct response principles and started teaching them and selling them on the internet. He was the original pioneer and his mentor was my mentor, Dan Kennedy. And there was this time when both these guys got together and they created a course called the ultimate internet entrepreneur. And it says the secret to dramatically increasing your internet income with offline direct marketing strategies. And it was Dan Kennedy and Corey Rudle getting together for a collab, one of the greatest collabs of all time, going together and teaching this stuff. And so I found this on the shelf the other day. This is coming back. It's old school with like CDs, DVDs. The actual, this course is used to come way back in the day. They're really fun. I bought this back in 2002 for $100 and it's still one of my prized possessions because of the story behind it. I want to tell you guys a little bit about it because if you don't know Corey Rudle is the reason why is he passed away in a tragic accident. He built his company. It was the first company teaching internet marketing. He was the guy. I think on the back here it said he did over $40 million in sales before his 30 second birthday shortly after that he got married. I think seven months after he went out and he was racing cars and he got in a car wreck and he passed away. And I remember this day was like this huge shock to the industry was the person we all looked up to the most, the person we were all learning from and studying. He was the trendsetter in our industry doing all the things that we were modeling and learning and he passed away. It was a very tragic event. That may be the reason why a lot of you guys don't know who Corey Rudle is, but it's important to understand because he was literally the pioneer. All the great things that we have done and developed in the internet marketing world all came originally from this man. The principles I want to share with you guys that came from this. Again, I bought this course in 2002. So I was 22 years old. This is a long time ago before some of you guys are even born. And it was interesting if you look at this, right? The internet was brand new. People were trying to figure this thing out. There was the dot com bubble burst and all kind of stuff. And you look at what most people were doing at the time. They thought the internet was going to be about branding, right? They were focusing on brand and putting this money into these all sorts of stuff. And what's interesting is if you look at this course specifically, right? The goal of what they were doing is taking Dan Kennedy. Dan Kennedy is an old school direct response marketer. Back then, I don't know if he was as old school as more like he was the guy like teaching direct response and Corey Rudle met him and Corey didn't do what everyone else was doing on the internet, which is like branding and putting your brand out there. He learned from Dan Kennedy said, I'm going to take these direct response principles. I'm going to use them on the internet, right? That's what he used to blow up his entire company. It's so timely because again, so many people nowadays, they come online, they see some influencers talking about stuff, they try some stuff to make some money here and there, but they build their foundation on sand. I can't tell you how many people in the last two decades I've seen whose businesses have come and gone and come and gone. And the reason why is they base their business based on these little tactics or like the algorithm changes of the day. They give them these little loopholes. They disappear and shift, right? But you look at like what Dan was teaching Corey, what Corey was teaching all of us back then was these core direct response principles. There's always a debate online, especially in the marketing business world, like brand versus direct response. And those who don't know what direct response is, direct response means we never put something out there just for branding, right? Like branding is a byproduct of good direct response marketing. Direct response means I need to be able to track the direct response of everything I put out there. Back in the day when you watch TV, right? You'd see the commercials and almost every commercials, branding, commercial, branding, commercial, every once in a while you'd see a direct response commercial. In fact, most of them were like late night infomercials or the Billy Mays short ads would pop in the middle, but the direct response ones, what was different about those is the branding companies, you look at the way that they're writing their ads, what they would do is most of these companies, they have a budget for advertising. But for most of us, we come in the world and that's what we're seeing. We see all the time like, I'm going to do what they're doing, right? And we try to do it. We don't have an advertising budget we can spend money on. So direct response is where literally you can track every single thing you're doing, right? For a lot of us nowadays, you've heard me preach you for other people talk about this a lot. The thing that Corey Rudle taught so specifically here that's coming back from a Dan Kennedy principle initially is like all the advertising you're doing online. The goal isn't necessarily immediately just to make your money back. The goal is to start building a list. That's the big secret. And the guy said, let me explain how this works. And a member in this article he kind of drew it out. He said, a lot of these big name gurus, wherever the people are following Corey that are doing what he's saying, they focus their direct response marketing to build an email list, right? You see, think about this. Imagine if you built the list and you had 10,000 people on a list, right? And you send an email out to that list and you're selling a $5 product, right? And listen, you get 10% of people to buy that. So if you get 10,000 people, right, 10% would be a thousand people who spend $5,000. They just made, what's the math on that, right? $5,000. So now imagine if your list is big, let's say your list is 30,000 people, right? You send an email out to that list, maybe your product, let's say your product is $50, right? So a $50 product. And I send out, let's say I get 10% conversions, 3,000 people buy a $50 product, now the math's getting too big. They make a lot of money, right? And that's them sending one email to the list. He said, that's the big secret. That's what all these gurus are doing, right? They're focusing on building a big email list and then they create offers. So they have the emails and they create an offer they sell people offer and they can do that every day, day in and day out, over and over and over again. And I remember when he said that, like it all clicked for me. I was like, that's a secret. That's it. Like if I understood this, if I can figure out how to build an email list, it'll change everything for me. And so everything that Dan and Corey were teaching is like, how do you use Director's Sense Mark and yes, to sell products more specifically to build an email list because that is the secret. That's the holy grail. That's the thing and how you win in this game. Shortly after I met Mark Joyner, who's my next mentor. And I remember, I had learned this, but there were all these like shiny objects that were happening back in the day. Like people were doing ads since and they were like putting ads on sites, making money. And people were doing like all these different things. And Mark Joyner was my next mentor. And Mark was like, Russell, you have to focus on building lists. Like this is the most important thing. I'm like, but there's all these people making tons of money doing this. He's like, those things will go away. He's like, focus on building lists. That is the big secret. And so for me, I started focusing on building lists. I was growing a list. And I remember during that window, somebody told me this number, it was something that changed my life. They said that you should be able to average $1 per month, if I spell month, per subscriber on your list, right? So what that meant is like, if you were to get 1000 people on your list, you should make $1000 a month. You get $5000 on your list, you make $5000 a month. Now at the time, my wife and I had just bought in our very first duplex. I read Rich Dad, poor dad. I'm going to buy a house. So we spent like $150,000 to buy a house. We put a renter into it. And then we lived in the other half and it was cash flowing like $200 a month, $300 a month, something crazy like that. I remember how much risk I put into that. It was a lot of work for the $200, $300 a month cash flow we were getting from this one house. And that's how I was learning this right here. And I remember thinking $1 per month per subscriber. I'm like, if that's true, this is going to be the coolest thing in the world. And so I decided to do my very first test. I created my very first product. It was a product called Zip Brander. And on Zip Brander, I had a pop up because that's what Corey said. We didn't have landing pages back in the day. We did pop ups. So you would drive somebody through direct response ads. They would come to a page and you'd have a pop up come up and you'd ask for their name and email. So I built my very first site. I launched a head of a pop up come up. And when the pop up came up, the very first month, I remember I had 217 people join my list. I remember that number is like seared into my brain. And so I was thinking, okay, if that's true, I'm going to make $200 and 70 cents per month per subscriber. I'm like, that's true. That's almost what I'm making for my rental property. And so I followed the process. I started emailing my list. I would make them offers. I'd provide value and sure enough, my very first month, I ended up making about $300 that month. And I was like, Oh my gosh, this is insane. I need to focus on this. How do I get, how do I go from, you know, 200 to the people in my list to 10,000 to 30,000. So that became my focal point. I think the next tier I remember is I had a thousand people on my list. And that month I did a little over $1,000 in sales. Okay. I kept focusing on two or three months. I had 5,000 people on my list. I did over $5,000 in sales. And I remember, like, just, I was like, I can't believe this is working. Like this is the coolest thing in the world. And it kept growing. I was on a call one day and somebody told me, it said, the magic number is 30,000 30,000 people on your list. You're financially free after that. It's 30,000 people at 30 grand a month, which is what 360,000 a year. Like it's a great income. Like that's you're financially free at 30,000. So that became the marching in my mind is how do I get to 30,000 people a month? And I kept focusing on, I was trying different things and eventually I got to 30,000 people on my list and then 50,000 and 100,000 and a million. But you look at this like last 20, 25 years, this has been the key metric in my head. The reality is if you're good at this, you should make more than $1 per month per subscriber, but it's a good metric to kind of play with when you're thinking about the math behind this. Right. And so for some of you guys who understand list building, like you understand these principles and it's not new to you, but some of you guys, this may be the way to call it. I have like when I saw the math and numbers on this, it changed everything. The fact that I get 270 people on my list and I'm making as much as I was my real estate property. And here I just had to send an email to my list. It was insane. Okay. It all came back to these core fundamental principles of using direct response marketing to build an email list, to market to your customers. You know, I've written three books like dot com secrets, traffic secrets, expert secrets, but you look at what is the actual secret of making money on the internet. It's a secret I learned in 2002 from Corey Rudle, Dan Kennedy, and that is focusing on building a list. And if you focus on that, it'll change everything for you. It's the thing that when Google slaps is when Facebook kicks you out, when all the other things happen, it won't matter because email will always be there to sustain you and help you to grow and continue to be successful. I've had times where our ad accounts got shut down. I'm like, how do I make payroll tomorrow? I'm like, Oh, let's just send an email to the list. Dan Kennedy used to always say, send the bill to the herd. Like if you have something you want to buy, send the bill to the herd. It comes back to like that John Lennon quote with John Lennon and Paul McCartney, like they wanted to build a swimming pool in their backyard. And like, well, like we're only money for swimming pool instead of let's just ride ourselves a swimming pool. And so sat down, they wrote a song, they launched it. I think it was love, love me do. And from that, they got enough money from the royalties that they went and they bought themselves a swimming pool. Right? Same thing's true here. Like when you understand that like you have the audience, you have the email list, it is the thing that'll give you sustainability or business thing, how you grow your business, it's how you make money. And most people are so focused on all the other stuff, but the reality is just like it wasn't 2022. The only thing that actually matters is you building your list and building a relationship with that list. If you focus on that, that's how you become successful. That's how you grow a business today. All my videos always give you guys usually the cliff notes of the book that I'm talking about.
