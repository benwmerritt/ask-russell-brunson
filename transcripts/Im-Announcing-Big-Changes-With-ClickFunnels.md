Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson. I'm coming to you right now from Nmali here in Fiji. This is Tony Robbins' private resort that he bought 30 years ago and was building up for the last 30 years and been in a really fun MASH in my meeting where Tony's been in the meetings as well as some of the top marketers in the world and it's been a really nice time, a chance to hang out with some really cool people, but also a time to kind of unplug. I don't get that opportunity very often, especially recently with writing the book and everything else has been a lot. I had a chance to unplug, hang out with my wife, went to the spa a lot of times and really had a chance to kind of reflect on the last five years. In fact, ClickFunnels' five-year birthday is next week, so it's been five years since we launched this company and honestly six years since we started to kind of brainstorm me and building it. And so it's really the first time I had a chance to kind of decompress and to kind of think about stuff and think about what's my future look like and what's the future of ClickFunnels and where are we going? We have almost 400 employees now that work for ClickFunnels. We have over 95,000 active customers and so there's a lot online every single day and there's a lot of stress and a lot of pressure. And so because of that, I've just been really thinking a lot about what's the future? Not only the future for me, but the future for the ClickFunnels team and the future for all of you. So with that, we decided that we're going to be making a change. In fact, this Monday, September 23rd, is ClickFunnels' five-year birthday and on our birthday I'm going to be making a very big announcement. There's been rumors, rumors that we are acquiring some companies, that we're acquiring some of our competition people we used to tease and joke about. There's been rumors that ClickFunnels is selling, there's rumors we're going public, and I've been watching these rumors and I've been not commenting on any of them purposely because I didn't want to add fuel to the fire at any of them. But on Monday I'm going to have a chance to finally, and it's been killing me, I've been wanting to talk about this for so long, but I've been refraining on the podcast, on Facebook, everywhere, not talking about it. Just because I want to make sure that all the things actually go through. And now we have confirmation that they have and they will be going through. And so I'm excited, nervous, actually really nervous, but I know deep in my heart that this is the right decision, not only for me, but for our entire team and for the entire community as a whole. And so I think that some people might take it in different ways, but I do feel it is the right decision, it is the right time. And so we're going to make this all official on the ClickFunnels five-year birthday announcement. So I will be going live with the official announcement to share with you. So I recommend that you be there live. I want to make sure you hear it directly from the horse's mouth and not pass down from person to person. So make sure you block aside the time. Invite anybody else on your team who uses ClickFunnels, who is integral in the marketing of your business or your company. Make sure to invite them as well to be on this live announcement. The last five years have really been amazing and we're grateful for you guys and your support up to this point. We just want to make sure that you're all there so you can, as a family, we can talk about this together. And if you have questions, this will be your chance to actually ask me questions directly and get answers. Because I know there's going to be a lot of questions after this announcement. And I want to make sure you're there and I will be answering live. So do not miss the announcements coming up this Monday, September 23rd on the ClickFunnels 5 year birthday. Again, thank you so much for being part of this funnel hacker community, this family. And I can't wait to share with you and store what's going to be happening.
