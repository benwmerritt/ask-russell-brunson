Hey, this is Russell Brunson. I'm here right now inside of the Napoleon Hill Foundation after hours. They gave me the key to coming here to look through all of the manuscripts, the books, a whole bunch of unpublished things nobody's ever seen before. And I found some gold I want to share with you guys today. In fact, I'm going to share with you guys 30 ways to overcome failure, because if you fail in any area of your life, it could be your relationship, it could be business, it could be your health. I'm going to show you guys how to overcome that from some secret stuff I learned from my man, Napoleon Hill, right now in an unpublished book called The Will of Fortune. So I hope you enjoy this video to show you how to overcome all failures. The first thing I want to show you guys, for those who know Napoleon Hill, he's written a lot of books, a lot of manuscripts. He's my favorite author. The most popular book he wrote is called Thinking Girl Rich. He also wrote Outwitting the Devil, which is my personal favorite book. But this copy of Thinking Girl Rich, I'm going to show you guys something really cool. He wrote this to a girl he met. She's one of his students in one of his classes. He was teaching. Her name is Annie Lou Norman. It said, with the author's best wishes and recognition of her loyalty, initiative, ability, and sincerity in Napoleon Hill 1941. But then, two years later, he actually married her. And then he re-signed it again and said, now she has the book and the author, 1943, for which he is grateful, the Napoleon Hill. So he wrote this, signed it for initially when they were dating, and then again after they became married. So this copy of Thinking Girl Rich is cool. And the reason I'm actually at the foundation right now is we're putting together a challenge called the Thinking Girl Rich Challenge. I'm trying to find all the best stuff you ever taught. In fact, we found a bunch of videos in Napoleon Hill actually teaching this stuff. So during the challenge, people have a chance to watch the video footage of Napoleon Hill actually teaching these principles, which is cool. But anyway, what I want to talk to you today is about one of the manuscripts I found. It is so cool. One of the things you're going to love in here. So this is a two-book series that he wrote and never got published. The first one is called Hand of Destiny. If you remember of Secrets of Success, I actually have the rights to republish this one. So a lot of you guys actually own a copy of The Hand of Destiny, which is a really great book that he wrote that's never been published until recently. But I found the second book here that I'd never heard of. It's called Willa Fortune. And this is another unpublished Napoleon Hill manuscript. And so today, I read about 75% of it. I sat here and I read it. And I've got so many good ideas and so many things I want to share with you. In fact, the one that's most important, which is how I started this video talking about, he's called this thing the Willa Fortune. So again, this is not something he wrote 20 years ago. This was before the TV show Willa Fortune. It never was ever on. This was his thought. He kept thinking about success in life, how it's like a will. In fact, on the title page here, there's a quote, there's a will on which the affairs of men revolve. And its mechanism is such that it prevents any man from being always fortunate. I read that. I was like, that's so fascinating. Because we're always striving for success and achievement, right? And then as soon as we seem to get it, then it goes away again. And then we get it again, then it goes away. It's like he said this, Willa Fortune. So he's coming and going and coming and going. And so his whole book is talking about that. And part of it's telling his story of the ups and the downs of his own life. But then also all the people he interviewed. He got commissioned by Andrew Carnegie, who at the time was the richest man in the world, to go and spend 20 years writing the first ever philosophy on personal achievement. And he went out there and did that. And then from there, he wrote the Laws of Success. This is actually the original copy of the manuscript of Lesson 1 of Laws of Success, which I found here in the archives. If you open it, I want to break this thing from like the early 1920s, 1927. But this is like the actual manuscript from the book set. It's insane. I don't want to bend the pages because this is something you can easily sell right now for $1,500,000 online. So I don't want to ruin it. It's very precious. But anyway, kind of a cool artifact I found here as I was going through things. So he wrote these Laws of Success. Basically, there were 17 Laws of Success. Later, he shrunk them down into a book called Think and Growage, specifically for entrepreneurs. He wrote another one called How to Raise Your Own Salary, which is for people who had jobs who wanted to raise their salaries. And he's rewritten the book multiple different times in different ways, all coming back to the same principles of success. Again, he's my favorite author. And in this book, Will Fortune, there are a bunch of really cool things that I got from here that I think will be really valuable for you guys today. So I took notes on where they were. The first one here is on page 25. And in this, he's having this conversation with Andrew Carnegie, who's the richest man in the world at the time. Andrew Carnegie is about to give him this commission to go right 20 years of his life studying achievement and success and trying to figure out all these different things. And Carnegie says this quote that I read today. I was like, this is the cool thing. And this is one of the keys to being successful, keeping yourself out of that loop of success and failure, success and failure. So Carnegie said, life is just one continuous series of opening and closing of doors. And if we make life a success, we become proficient at both the closing and the opening of doors. The successful person firmly and definitely closes behind him the doors to every person, every thought, every experience, which causes him annoyance or failure. The unsuccessful person leaves open behind him the doors to every experience he's had and every person who has damaged him with the result that he makes the same mistake over and over and over again and permits the same enemy to sneak in by the open door and to feed him at will. So my thought for you is like, think about this. Like, if something bad happens, it could be a bad relationship, it could be a bad person, it could be a bad thought, it keeps entering your mind. Right, so successful people are good at shutting those doors and keeping those things away. Where unsuccessful keep them open so they keep kind of lingering in and keep coming in. Because some areas of my life I'm really good at like, nope, shutting the doors. In other areas, I leave the door open. I'm curious for you, what are the ones that you struggle with that you keep that door open when you know you should be shutting it? Then he goes on and talks a little bit more about this. He says, successful people do two things. They do them definitely and immediately when the need arises. They close behind them the doors of all negative people and influence, including the stray negative thoughts which slip into one's mind uninvited. And they fasten the doors tightly so they are free to turn their attention ahead of them, where they have free hand to open the doors of opportunity as they come to them. You see, the successful person must be a good door closer as well as a good door opener. The failure either leaves all the doors open behind him or in extreme cases of habitual failure, he actually stands with his foot in the opening. It's not even a chance or luck can close the door behind him. Of course, he cannot open the door of opportunity because he's too busy holding the door of failure through which he has just passed. Oh, it's so fascinating. So I actually think about this, if I want to get off this will of fortune that keeps happening, we have to be good at closing doors behind us. Our negative thoughts, negative people, negative emotions, it's hard. Sometimes, especially, it's like people you love or people you care about. Having us have someone in your life who is the negative force keeps pulling you back down. Someone you love, someone you care about. It's like, how do we close those doors so those negative thoughts aren't holding us back? As long as that negative door is open, people can slip in. Ideas can slip in. It keeps you from moving forward. I love the analogy where he's like, you got a foot holding the door open, you can't reach for the opportunity to open the new door because you're so focused on keeping the other door closed. A lot of people talk about, you let the dead bury this dead. Yesterday's gone forever, sliver today, burn your bridges behind you, and turn towards the future. Those are the things he's talking about to get us out of it. So that's my first kind of big nugget I got from here as I was reading for all of you guys. For me specifically, it's just, OK, think about the things that are holding back. I need to close those doors and close those doors. I got some more cool stuff. Before we do, you guys want to see some more cool Napoleon Hill things? OK, right here. This is actually Napoleon Hill's pen. If you ever look at when Napoleon Hill signed most books, it was in green ink. And this is the actual pen that he would use, he carried with him to sign all of the books and stuff. So this is his actual pen, which is kind of cool. Another cool artifact I found here at the foundation was Napoleon Hill's glasses. If you've ever seen pictures of them, these are the glasses he wore everywhere. What's crazy about it is, look how small these things are. His head is like 1 third the size of mine. My head is huge. And one of the cool Napoleon Hill artifacts I found, if you don't know Napoleon Hill, one of his laws of success is the Golden Rule, which is due into others as you would have them doing to you. It was crazy, it was almost every religion has a version of the Golden Rule. And back then, in the early 1900s, everyone was talking about the Golden Rule. For some reason nowadays, we don't talk about it. We don't discuss it. No one ever mentions it, it feels like. Yet for them, it was such a big thing. In fact, before he wrote Laws of Success, he launched a magazine called Hill's Golden Rule. He would publish it for a year and eight months. I happen to have every single copy of the magazine, because I'm kind of a nerd. But anyway, he was obsessed with the Golden Rule. It's one of his laws of success, went over and over and over again. And the other thing I found is this Golden Ruler. How cool is this? The Golden Rule is really, really heavy. It has its initials, NH, Napoleon Hill. So not only was he obsessed with the Golden Rule, he had his own Golden Rule that he had to keep him on the straight and narrow. So I thought that was kind of cool. So all of us, we got to remember the Golden Rule, remember to do it into others as you would have them do it to you, because that solves almost all of the problems, which is really fascinating. OK, page 29, he's talking about, again, one of his favorite laws, my personal favorite law that Napoleon Hill talks about, is called Definitiveness of Purpose. Which means you know exactly the thing you want. I want to win a two comic book award. I want to get healthy. I want to win a state title. I want to know exactly what it is. We're very specific. And so he talks about that a lot. And here he says, a really cool quote. He says, men you know exactly what they want and are determined to get it, seem to tune into some supernatural power not available to those who drift with time and with circumstances. So when you pick that thing, here's the definite purpose I want. He's like, everything else falls away. It becomes a supernatural power. Your brain starts figuring, how can I get that thing? How can I get that thing? It's fascinating when I meet people the first time they ask me how to be successful. And the first thing they ask is, what do you want? Most people don't know. They're like, I want to be more successful. I want to make some more money. I'm like, no, it's a purpose. It's a definite purpose. What is the thing you actually want? All the things in my life that I had success with because I knew exactly what it was. I want to be a state champion. It was a definite purpose. I knew exactly what it was. Not only what it was, but what it was. I want to be a state champion by the time my junior year in high school boom, I hit it. When I got into business, I want to make a million dollars in a year. It took a couple of years and I hit it. I was like, I want to make 10 million a year. I hit it. I want to make 100 million a year. I hit it, right? But it all came back to having a definite purpose. And so it's kind of a fascinating thing. So you talk about that when you have a definite purpose, it says you seem to tune into some supernatural power not available to those who drift with time or circumstance. I thought that was really cool. OK, the next thing I want to share with you guys is this was Andrew Carnegie, who again was the richest man in the world of the time. This was his list. As you're talking to Paul Heal, he had a list of the major causes of failure. As I was reading through it, I was like, oh my gosh, if people understood this and really start thinking about why they're not successful, it almost always ties to one of these causes. And I wanted to create this video for those who are struggling with anything, right? That could be business, could be health, could be relationships, we're struggling. And we start understanding what are the causes of failure? And you start fortifying yourself against those things. That's what helps you be more successful. So I'm going to go through this list for you guys. That was really cool. So the very first thing in the list that causes failure is it causes the habit of drifting with circumstances without a definite aim, plan, or purpose. And we just talked about that, right? Paul Heal talks about people who were driven, who have a definite purpose, versus people who drift. And drifting is just, I think about like this, he talks about it in Outwind of the Dead, it calls a hypnotic rhythm. We're just kind of in this like drifting thing, we're just bumping around, you're not doing anything, there's no forward momentum in your life, right? If you're failing life, it's probably because you don't have a direction you're going, right? That's number one. Okay, number two is unfavorable physical hereditary foundation, which no man can control. So that one's kind of tough. Basically, you have hereditary, it doesn't allow you to be successful. So we can't do anything about number two, so we're not going to worry about that one. Number three, a lack of definite major purpose as a life goal. It comes back to the opposite of drifting, which is actually having the definite purpose. Number four, inadequate schooling in and out of school room, right? So people who aren't learning enough. A lot of people have problems, but they're not trying to find the answers, they're not reading books, listening to podcasts, like they're just like, I have this problem, and they can't get stuck in this motion, right? Like if you want to have success in something, you have to get the education. I'm not talking about necessarily school, I'm not a huge fan of the school system, but becoming self-educated, finding those things and getting the schooling, self-education, right? Number five is lack of self-discipline, generally manifesting self through excesses in eating, drinking, sexual relationships, and indifference toward opportunities for mental development. So they don't have self-discipline, so they're just doing the things that give them pleasure immediately as opposed to working towards the thing that give them long-term fulfillment. Because always this fight between pleasure and fulfillment, right? Where you get the reward without the work. When people just look for the reward, like what's the quickest way for me to get the reward that I'm actually putting in the work? That's when you don't fulfill, that's when your life becomes a failure. It's that transition to fulfillment, a transition towards doing the actual work to get yourself the reward. So it's kind of fascinating. Number six, lack of ambition to aim above mediocrity and choosing an occupation. So just like, ah, I'm just going to do whatever I do. Like, don't be a mediocrity and choosing your profession. And number seven, ill health generally due to wrong thinking and improper diet. Health is when we can control 100%. Like, we can control what we put into our mouth, right? That's a simple thing to do. So ill health. And number eight, unfavorable environmental influences during childhood. That's a hard one to overcome. A lot of people are raised in bad circumstances, bad areas, bad things. And that's when we have to figure out how to get ourselves in a spot where we can change our environment, our circumstances. Nine, lack of persistence in caring through on finishing what one begins. A lot of people who start a project, but they're not going to finish a project. Starting a project, anyone can do that. But unless you finish it, it doesn't actually matter. So that's number nine. Number 10 is negative personality in which habits offensive to others are developed. A lot of times in the laws of success, the employee will talk to you about having a positive personality and a pleasing personality, where you can get along with people. This is talking about the cause of failures, having a negative personality, right? You have to learn how to communicate with other humans and be happy and have energy and excitement, right? Number 11, lack of understanding and control through transmutation of the emotion of sex. I'm not going to go deep into that one, but obviously there's a whole bunch of problems you can't control that part of your life. Number 12 is uncontrolled desire for something for nothing, usually expressed in dishonesty in the habit of gambling, the reward without the work. Gambling's all about how do I shortcut things? How do I get the reward to actually do the work? And so gambling is another one that causes failure. Number 15, lack of the habit of reaching decisions promptly and firmly. You can't make decisions, you're going to struggle in life, right? We have to learn how to be able to say, okay, two options, which one looks the best, and take it, learning how to make decisions and the most powerful things you can do to keep you from failure. A lot of people will sit in their life drifting for so long because they're too scared to make a decision and they never get out of it. And not making a decision is always the worst of the decisions, right? So you have two decisions, but you always actually have a third one, which is doing nothing. A lot of people default to the third. Okay, let's keep going. You guys have a good time so far? Learn to cool Napoleon Hill stuff? From an unpublished manuscript, this is insane. Okay, and this is stuff that Andrew Carnegie literally taught to Napoleon Hill, which makes it just that much cooler. The richest man in the world is like, this is the reason why people fail. Like what does he know that we don't know? Like these are the things. Okay, number 14, one or more of the six basic fears. The six basic fears we have in this focusing too much on fear of poverty, fear of criticism, fear of ill health, fear of loss of love, fear of old age, fear of death. Number 15, wrong selection of a maiden marriage. I always tell people we can only be as successful as your spouse or significant other will allow you to be. To make sure you're picking the right maiden marriage. The habit of being over cautious in personal relationships. So it's negative to be over cautious. So you need to be willing to go all in on relationships and you can know people, even though it can be scary, even though there can be risks associated, don't become over cautious in personal relationships. Number 17 is lack of all form of caution. So some caution is good, otherwise you're gonna get some failure. Number 18, wrong choices of association in business and social relationships, picking the wrong friends, right? Number 19, wrong selection of vocation or total neglect to make a choice. It's not having a job that you want. We're not picking it all. Number 20, lack of concentration or effort. We're gonna concentrate. Number 21, the habit of an indiscriminate spending without a budget controller, income and expender. Don't be spending how much money you don't have. Learn how to budget your money. Don't spend more than you make. This comes back from what I always talk about like you need to produce more than you consume. If you're consuming more than you're producing, that's where the imbalance happens, right? In health, right? Like if you were consuming more calories than you're burning, that's when you gain a lot of weight, right? This is true in all areas of life. If you are consuming, so spending more money than you are producing and you're making, that's when you get into debt. People always ask me, how do you get rich? I'm like, you have to learn to produce more than you consume. Like what do you mean? How much money does it cost you to live? Like $2,000 a month. That's what you're consuming. So you learn to produce enough value, right? If you're only producing $2,000 a month of value, then you're only gonna make $2,000 a month. You learn to produce $10,000 in value a month, and you're only consuming $2,000, that's where you start making profit, right? You get a point where you're producing $100,000 a month in value or $1,000,000 a month in value. That's where you get rich, right? So learn to produce more than you consume, which comes back to what this talked about here. 23, which is lack of controlled enthusiasm. You gotta be excited, but be controlled with it. Number 24, intolerance. A closed mind based particularly on ignorance or prejudice and connection with religious, political, or economic subjects. So be tolerant of other people, not intolerant. We got a few more you guys. Number 25, inability to neglect or cooperate with others in the spirit of harmony. Number 26, possession of power not acquired on merit. Rich men's children, for example. So again, if you didn't earn it, if you're getting the reward without the effort. Number 27, lack of the spirit of loyalty based on intentional dishonesty. You gotta be honest in all your dealings. Number 28, egotism and vanity are not under control. Number 29, the habit of forming opinions and building plans based on guesswork instead of organized facts. And the last one is lack of insufficient imagination to recognize favorable opportunities. And then self-reliance to brace them if and when they are recognized. So if you are struggling with failure, it's probably one of those things. And go back through that listener, look at me, what are the things I'm struggling with? Like, wow, I am consuming more than I'm producing. Wow, I am not having concentrated focused effort. I have no definite purpose. I am drifting. All those things are signs of the things that are keeping you from the thing that you desire the most. And again, it's all here inside this book, Will of Fortune, which is so cool. Like how do we get off of this Will of Fortune? It goes up and down and up and down. Okay, I think I have one last thing I wanna share with you guys, maybe two. So one of them is the quote that Andrew Carnegie gave Napoleon Hill as a definition of success. And I'm always looking for this because everyone has their own definition of success. For me, my definition is success equals achievement plus fulfillment. I like to be successful at at least two things. Like the thing that you're trying to achieve and strive towards plus fulfillment. Like when you have both those things that ask for your successful. Earl Nightingale's got a whole different definition of success. And this is the one that Andrew Carnegie gave Napoleon Hill, which is cool, he said, success in the broad sense of the word is the power with which to acquire what everyone wants in life without violating the rights of others and remaining in good terms with your own conscious. So I thought that was kind of a fascinating thing. A couple of other cool things he talked about. This is another great Napoleon Hill quote that he got from Andrew Carnegie. He talked about failure, right? We get these failures, but he said, if you look at it, he says, every failure brings with it the seed of an equivalent advantage. So you have a failure that's coming to you and it's like, you get that thing, it also comes with the seed of equivalent advantage. One of my favorite stories about this for my life, 12, 13 years ago, I had built the company, we had about 100 employees at the time, and it was growing and it was like, everything's working well, and literally almost overnight, everything collapsed. Like we lost our merchant accounts, I had employees walk out at me, everything, and I went from having 100 employees to shrinking down to about five. And I had to get on my lease. I had to, it was definitely the most dark and painful time of my life. I had friends who I thought were my best friends who walked out on me. I had family members who worked for me, who literally walked out on me. Like it was really weird, like it was a really hard time in my life. My biggest failure at the time. And I remember thinking like, I'm a failure. And it took me three or four years to rebuild from that failure. But in the rebuilding, I shrunk down to five or six employees. We got this little tiny office, we were trying to figure things out. During that process is where, when we were trying to figure out what we were gonna do with our lives, I bought a company that I couldn't afford. I bought this little company, long story short, I needed a program, I knew Ruby on Rails. I didn't have a Ruby on Rails developer, I couldn't find one, I put an email out to my list, and I met Todd Dickerson, who became my partner in ClickFunnels. And Todd started working with us. And from there, from the seed that was planted in that failure, grew a company that's now done over a billion dollars in sales called ClickFunnels. It's just fascinating. So that quote is so powerful for all of us. Like, every failure brings with it the seed of an equivalent advantage. So like, when you're going through failure and struggle, it's like looking like, what's that seed? I don't know where it is yet, but somewhere in there there's coming a seed. If I plant it, and if I water it, I nurture it, it's gonna grow into something amazing. Okay, and it's always easier in hindsight to see it, but having faith in the moment of the failure, like, okay, I don't understand this, doesn't make any sense. I believe God's got a plan for me. There's a seed somewhere. I'm gonna keep planting this and watering it. Hopefully it sprouts into something amazing. Another cool thing that Napoleon will talk about is the success and failure often hinge upon a person's interpretation of the obstacles he encounters, whether he accepts them as a stumbling block or a stepping stone, a permanent failure or a temporary defeat. So when these failures come, like the difference between someone successful and someone's failure is how you look at those failures, right? Is this a stumbling block or is this a step for the next opportunity? Which is such a cool analogy as well. He said, anyone can quit when the going becomes hard, and that is exactly what the drifter without major purpose or plan in life does. But you are no drifter. You have a definite goal worthy of all the sacrifices and struggle you can put into it. All right, I got one last thing. So again, to come back to the story I started with, Napoleon Hill, when he was a young man, went to Andrew Carnegie, the richest man in the world, and he had a three-day interview with me, interview for magazine, and during the three days, Andrew Carnegie gave him Napoleon three principles. And Napoleon said at the end of the three days, he said, there's the nucleus of what became the laws of success, okay? And the laws of success, again, is this is the original manuscript from it, but the laws of success was, in fact, I have the actual manuscript for laws of success right here behind me. I'm gonna show it to you guys real quick because this is one of the coolest things in the world. I did not own this. I wish I did. I could sell this on the market today for probably two and a half to $3 million, which is crazy. And this is the actual hand-typed book, the laws of success. So this is the size of the book. Like, this is insane. So Napoleon interviews Andrew Carnegie, and then goes on a 20-year journey to write this book set, right? And it's insane. And in here, there are 16 laws of success. And throughout time, Napoleon changed it. Eventually, he partnered with W. Clemstone. They added 17 laws. So depending on you might hear, there's 16 laws of success, there's 17, but there's times that there were 15, but this is like the laws of success. And when he finished with Carnegie, he said Carnegie gave him three laws. He said this became the nucleus for the entire work that was his entire life. For law and success, for thinking, for all these different things, like this was the nucleus of the information he got from Andrew Carnegie. So the three things. The first day, he spent an entire day teaching him about the mastermind principle. What's the mastermind principle? So you take two people in the room, put them together. It creates a third mind, which is the mastermind. So if it's just you thinking, or just someone else, put them together, it creates a third mind. We now, all the ideas become better. And he talked about Carnegie, how he built the biggest company on the planet at the time, how he became the richest man in the world. He said he didn't know they answered all the questions, but he got all the people around him to build a mastermind group. And then they went and then from that, he raised the money, he poured the steel. He did all the things to build Carnegie Steel, which became the biggest company in the world. And then Napoleon talked about also the power of mastermind, even when you don't know people. In Think and Growers, there's a chapter where he talks about, he calls it his invisible counsel. And some people think it's kind of woo and weird, but he's like, I couldn't afford to have a mastermind group of people, so he said, I thought about my favorite people, like Abraham Lincoln and Ralph Waldo Emerson, and all these different people he looked up to, his favorite authors, he would pass away and he thought about them. So he'd have an idea, he'd sit there, he'd start thinking, like, what would Lincoln say? What would so and so say? And he'd read their books and stuff, and from there, ideas start popping into his head. So even if you don't have a physical mastermind, you can still visualize people, and his ideas will come into your head. And he talks about actually in the Will of Fortune book. So the mastermind principle is the first thing. The second one was the principle of definite purpose, knowing exactly what you are. And number three is the principle of the habit of profiting from your failures. So looking at your failures, not as stumbling blocks, but as stepping stones, right? Learning how to actually do that. And so those became the three principles, and he gave those to Napoleon Hill, and if you read his books, those are some of the three core principles initially. And then from there, Napoleon Hill went on his journey where he went and interviewed Henry Ford, who built Ford Motor Company. He interviewed Thomas Edison, he interviewed all these different people, and from there kept learning from all these people, started adding these different laws of success and principles to it. But the beginning were these three, and still three are my favorite. The mastermind principle, the principle of definite purpose, and then the principle of the habit of profiting from your failures. So nothing else you get from this, learn those three things, right? Build a mastermind group, choose a definite purpose, and then go through all the things we talked about about how to not fail. Like going through that list, I just wanted to do it earlier. These are all the ways that people fail. Like go through that list, figure things out, figure how to not have those things happen to you. Learn how to close the doors behind you, to the failures, to the negative thoughts so you can keep moving forward. And those are some of the things I learned today as I was studying this insanely cool manuscript for a book that's unpublished, no one knows in the whole world called Will of Fortune by Napoleon Hill. I hope you enjoyed the summary and got some cool ideas from it. If you did, let me know your favorite thing. Was it something from Will of Fortune? Was it the idea of closing the doors? Did you like seeing Napoleon Hill's golden ruler? Was it the statue? Was it his cool pen or the eyeglass? Was it like, what was your favorite part about this? Let me know, and let me know if you enjoy videos like this where I'm going deep into these books and pulling out some of the cool concepts and ideas that I love. And if so, let me know and I'll find some more stuff. Again, in this room alone, there's tens of millions of dollars with unpublished books and manuscripts that I have a chance to go through right now, and it's a lot of fun. So that's it, thank you so much for listening and watching, and tune in for the next video where I tell you guys some more cool stuff about this man, Mr. Napoleon Hill.
