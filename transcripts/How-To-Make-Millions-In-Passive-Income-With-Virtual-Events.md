The biggest problem most of us entrepreneurs have is like creating your stuff, right? And so before I was creating so many things that business got super complex, where now it's like this part of the business is done and I never have to touch it ever, ever again. COVID, how many guys did a virtual event? How many has done it twice since COVID hit? Three times it's COVID hit. Four times. How many guys did it live every single time? So here's my experience. So COVID hit, everyone freaked out obviously. So our numbers, like funnel hacking live, cost us about $3 million to put on. Takes me nine months to fill it and it's a lot of stress and headaches, right? So we did our version which we call it 2, Club Live. It cost us $50,000 to fulfill and it took us three weeks to do it, right? Funnel hacking live, usually we end up selling about 500 people into our 25k program and we did this one, we got about half that. So we got 250-ish people that paid for the 25k from the virtual event. So that was amazing. I was like, that was awesome. But I was like, man, I want to do it again. And so five months later we did the campaign again, just sent the same email, same everything, got people signed up, like everything was the same. I went back and did day number one, I got to tweak some stuff to teach it a little differently, a little better. Did day one, did day number two, and the end of day number two, Dean was like, hey, you know what, you're supposed to come in two days to Antoni's plane to go hang out with us. And I was like, yeah, he's like, we're actually leaving tonight. I'm like, I'm in the middle of my live, I have 100 other days, I'm going live tomorrow, I can't just leave. And he's like, well, then you can't fly to Antoni's plane. And I was like, crap, what do I do? Like, I don't want to miss this. And so I... When do you get a chance to fly in a living room? Yeah, like seriously, I can't miss this. And so I get off stage, I'm stressing out, because like, we had to be at the airport in a couple hours, and I'm like, and I have a whole other day of teaching. And so I went back to the audio video guys, I'm like, can you just do day three from like five months ago and just push play and just make it look live again and keep doing the breakout rooms and all this stuff, but just do that. And they're like, yeah, we can do that. I'm like, oh my gosh, okay. So that we jumped on a plane, saw Jen and Drew, and it was amazing. Day three happened, I was in there, I was in the plane, nobody knew, they still did everything the same. So I went back and last month we did it again, and this time I didn't show it for any of it. The entire thing ran, they presented it, they did the breakout rooms. I did a little video at the very beginning that was like, hey, this, the apart season may be live, but a lot of this can be recorded just, you know, and kind of like set it up that way and we ran it. Same sales, same clothes rate, same everything, nothing shifted. I just didn't go into the live during that time, and it was amazing. And now we have it set up in queue, it happens once a quarter, every single quarter, and the numbers have been pretty, pretty standard the whole way. So if you haven't ever dreamed your thing yet, it's amazing. It'll be going once a quarter for the rest of my life. I told my team when I die, it needs to keep running, because it's just done, it's perfect, and it's awesome. And then the way I orchestrated this event too, by the way, is because it was COVID, I couldn't fly everybody in and do big guest speakers and stuff, so I was like, okay, well, if I was going to do an event, what would be the first thing I would want to teach? Half of the presentations were me teaching a certain piece I wanted to know, the other half were like, here's Dean's presentation, this one makes sense here, and here's from old events. That event, like half of it I didn't even teach, I just got on stage, okay, the next presentation, this was like so-and-so, FHL, they taught about summit funnels, it's the most important thing, the presentation would be awesome. We're gonna keep the video right now, ready, go, and I step off stage and we watch an hour-long video, and I come back, I kinda anchor it, teach the next piece, and so a lot of it was just old presentations from our big event, but put together in the right chronological order so that by the time someone's done, they have a really clear picture of like, oh my gosh, I know exactly what I need to do in the order I need to do it. The initial video starts, I say, hey, I did this live once, I did the live a second time, second time, parts of it we just replayed, because it was so good. This time, depending, we may record some new, some, you know, sorry, I don't lie, I tell them exactly what it is, it's just an encore edition, some parts may be live, some may be video, either way, you're live, breakout room's live, we're gonna participate 100%, let's go, and then it queues up and starts. So the other thing is, we're talking about challenges, so we've been doing our one funnel away challenge, it's a $100 challenge. Now, for almost three years, we've been preaching challenges, I don't talk a lot about, but it's changed our whole business, it's changed the conversion, the stick rates, how long people retain, like, so many things have been awesome. And so what happens is at the end of the one funnel away challenge now, if you've gone through my book, should I have this thing called value ladders, it's like we move them up. So from here now, we pitch everybody into the Two Comma Club Live, Two Comma Club Live event, which is what we just showed you right here. So this is kind of the ascension. So what happens is, OFA's all automated as well now, it doesn't, I'm not part of it, it's all hot, it happens every two weeks. So if you look like a calendar, every two weeks, there's a new OFA that starts, so twice a month it happens, and so we got basically six OFA's, all fuel people into that. So that's why we don't do this more often. And this is, to run this, it's a bigger production because we gotta have Zoom rooms and all that kind of, you know, it's a team of people doing it that aren't me. So we do that once a quarter where this is all in place, we got live coaches that facilitate this, but it's every two weeks, a new version, one funnel way launches, and we get about 1500 to 2000 people per two weeks that join this at a hundred bucks a piece. And so everything we're doing right now funnels into one funnel way. Like if you go to onefunnelway.com like that, we drive tons of traffic, they spend a lot of money. We pay affiliates a hundred percent commissions, we have a lot of affiliates, their entire business is just promoting one funnel way because they get a hundred percent of the money. It's in the back end of every funnel, it's like upsell two on almost every one of our funnels, like if someone joins, click funnels, they get a phone call, it sells OFA, so everything we're doing is getting people into this paid challenge. And so it consists of like 1500 to 2000 people every two weeks, enter a new cohort of it, and then from there, they get pushed into the quarterly two comic club live. The biggest thing I'm trying to do in my business is extending the boundaries of who we're getting beyond just our existing universe, right? So to join one funnel away, you have to know what a funnel is, otherwise why would you, you know, if you walk down the chiropractor down the street, I'm like, hey, do you want to join the one funway challenge? They're not going to join. And so I was like, I want to create something down here that's bigger, that brings more people in like a challenge that opens up the gate bigger and targets a very specific segment. And so the first one we did was five day lead challenge because every business owner knows what lead is, you know, I don't explain anything. And so we did the five day lead challenge. Man, I'm so excited for this. I literally could not sleep last night. I was tossing and turning in my bed. They offered the end of five day lead challenge was $100 to the OFA challenge. And so that did awesome for us. It opened up a huge new segment. Basically any business needs a lead open to that segment. It did awesome live. And then we've been driving traffic to it pretty consistently since then. It grabs people in and pulls them up. And this is evergreen. So we want to see an evergreen version of a challenge. If you go to fivedayleadchallenge.com, that's there. It's evergreen. We're buying ads to it every single day. And now what we're doing is creating front ends that are different challenges that grab different segments of the market. So the entire goal is just to get people in here to get to OFA, which then OFA gets into Comical Live and keeps taking them through. So that's what's kind of fun for me because now the biggest problem most of us entrepreneurs have is we like creating new stuff, right? At least I definitely know for me. And so before I was creating so many things that business got super complex. Where now it's like this part of the business is done. I never have to touch it ever, ever again. And so my creativity is not like, what's the next coaching program? What's the next thing? It's just all my creativity goes. And what's another friend that I can create that grabs a different segment of the market and brings them in. So I could do a challenge or I could write a book or I could do a thing. And so I can focus my creativity on little things that just grab different segments in and then push them through the thing that's already built and done and working and automated without me.
