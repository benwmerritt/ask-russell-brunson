## Transcript
Have you ever wondered what every single successful business, brand, cult, and even church has in common? Well, they all built a mass movement. I want you to think about a mass movement as a group of people all moving towards something based on a shared identity. So they all believe in something they're all excited by, and any good product or service throughout time has created these types of mass movements. Think about it with Tesla, right? Elon Musk created a mass movement of people who are obsessed with this, who will follow him to the end of the earth. Steve Jobs is the same thing with Apple and the iPhone, right? That's what a mass movement is, and every business needs to be able to create that to get your customers to move and to change with you. They might be thinking, well, that's cool Russell, but I'm not Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. And the reality is you don't have to be when you understand some very core principles. Now, a little while ago, I started researching deeply, how do you create a mass movement? How do the biggest churches, how do they do it? How do the biggest cults, how do they, on the positive and negative side, how do people create these mass movements? I started studying it, and when it all boils down, I figured out there's only three things that actually matter. And these three things aren't difficult, they're actually pretty simple when you understand them, to apply it into any business to create a movement of people who are going to go to the ends of the earth to buy your products and your services. And so a little while ago, I spoke on Grant Cardone's 10X stage, you may have heard the stories about it. I did over $3.2 million in sales in just 90 minutes, and at the end of it, I saw the course teaching people how I spoke from stage and how I did everything. But there's a part of that course where I go deep into how do you create a mass movement. And this is the key for so many business, so many people are missing this one piece. And so what I did is I actually went into that course and pulling out the section on mass movements, I wanted to give it to you as a gift for free for being a subscriber of our channel. So with that said, I'm going to want you to watch this movie, and while you're watching it, start thinking about how you can create a mass movement inside of your business. I don't care if you're selling supplements or information products or software, or whatever it is you're selling, it doesn't matter. The psychology behind how to get people to follow you is the same. I hope you really enjoy this presentation. I hope you learn a ton from it. If you do, make sure to hit that like button and let me know down in the comments below. There's three quart components to any mass movement. And so I'm going to draw out this little triangle right here. This is the pattern of how all mass movements throughout time have been created. If I want to create any kind of movement, small movement, medium movement, if I want to do more of my family, my religion, whatever it is you're trying to do, it doesn't matter, the process is the same. So if you look at this, the first thing, every mass movement, they have, I like to call it attractive character or charismatic leader. There's somebody there that people can identify with. Okay, so there's that. Now in most of these movements, especially for you guys who are doing this process, it's usually going to be you or someone on your team or maybe it's a success story, whatever, there's a person that's associated with it, right? And it's happening more and more nowadays. You know, a hundred years ago, people would identify and associate with the brand. Nowadays, it's different. People don't associate with brands nearly as much as they associate with humans, right? We're in a connection economy, like we connect with people. And so most good businesses, there's a human being tied into it. And that's what causes people to stick is the human, it's the attractive characters, the charismatic leader, the person they can plug into and be like, that person's going to take me where we're going. If you have an idea that you genuinely think is good, don't let some idiot talk you out of it. ClickFunnels is a software company. Why are we beating out all the other software companies in our space? Besides the fact our software is the best, like there's connection. People feel connected to me, right? They've read my books, they understand my stories, like there's connection there. Or even like, let's say some other software comes out with a different feature or it's cheaper or whatever, right? Because there's connection, people aren't leaving. For every single one of those lights out there, there's somebody, if I can help you to get your message, your product, your service out to more people, that's how the world's going to change. And that's what we're going to be doing today. Number two, is all of them have a future-based cause. So future-based cause is like, where are we going? Every mass movement, there's a cause. Like we're going this direction guys. This is where we're collectively going as a group. Okay, that's why people, they buy into something, right? Think about the movements that you're part of. Think about whatever religious thing you believe in, okay? Is there a future-based thing? Are you all working towards something? Think about the businesses. Think about software. Think about like whatever it is you're part of. He's gooder. I bid you stand, then, on the West! And the third one, one I'm going to spend a little more time on today, is that they always offer somebody a new opportunity. And this right here is the key to create an offer, is the new opportunity. Okay, if you try to make it cause a movement and you only have one of the three here, it's going to tip over. It's like a table with only two legs, like it just can't stand up, right? So it starts here, like figuring out this piece first, is what is the new opportunity? One of the biggest mistakes that people make is when they create a product, an offer, a thing that they're selling people. What they traditionally do is they create what we call an improvement offer. Okay, improvement offer means you're going to help people improve. They're going to become better, faster, stronger, smarter. Usually there's an ER after an improvement offer. Okay, the problem with improvement offers is a lot of them. One of the biggest problems with improvement offer is for somebody to say, I want to improve, they have to admit that they suck at something. Baby, I'm not good enough. Yes, you are. No. No, maybe I'm not. Yes, you are. Maybe I'm not. Okay, in us humans, we have this weird thing with pride and all sorts of things where it's really hard for us to say, like, I'm really bad at that thing. So for them to say, I'm going to become better, I say, I suck at this thing, therefore I'm going to become better. So you're fighting against that. Number two is a lot of people have desires, right? Like they have desire to be better, to be smarter, but to improve, it doesn't take just desire, it takes ambition. Now, while everybody has desire, I would say maybe two to three percent of the population actually has ambition. And so the only people are going to say yes to an improvement offer, people who actually have ambition. Does that make sense? For the most part, a new opportunity, I want to create a new opportunity that's desire. So if I'm creating something and it's an improvement offer, again, I'm only going to get the people who are ambitious who take it, which is not the masses. Okay. And so instead, I got to create a new opportunity. So what's a new opportunity? A new opportunity is something completely different. If I'm going to do a new opportunity with nice things, I don't have to say, oh, I suck at this, therefore I'm going to make a new opportunity. You just basically come back saying, look, that thing you tried in the past is horrible. In fact, I'm going to draw this. This is the way you can figure out new opportunities. This is the easiest way. It's look at this. Like here's a little mountain right here, right? And here is the result that your person wants to get. There's a little flag. Yay. Okay. And so they're down here and they're looking up the mountain and they're looking up here and saying, that's what I want. I want to lose weight. I want to make money. I want a new car. I want to like, whatever, like this is the result they want. Nothing will stop us from our goal. Nothing. This is the result they want. Now, the problem is that if they are coming to you, my guess, for most of you guys who are at the 10X event or you've heard me speak, like, you didn't know that your goal was to build funnels, right? All you do is I want to grow my company. I want to 10X my company. I want to make more money, right? You came to the 10X event in your car and you're getting there. All of these speakers come up and every single speaker is presenting you guys a new car. And they're like, that car you're in right now, it sucks. It's not going to get you your result. You want a 10X, not going to happen. But I've got a car that's way better. Get out of your car. Come into my Ferrari. This Ferrari over here, this car is better. It's faster, it's stronger and it'll get you your result way faster. So if you don't know what your new opportunity is, a couple of things. I want you to map this out and say, okay, here's my dream customer. They're sitting right here. This is the result I'm trying to offer them. Whatever it is you're selling them. And the first thing we ask is what vehicle are they currently in trying to get that result? What's the vehicle that they're in? They're doing something, right? So you have to figure out what is the opportunity that they're currently in? What's the vehicle that they're trying to get that result? What are you switching them into? My firmest belief, the vehicle that you guys need to have to build a 10X your company in the next 12 months is the funnel. All I did when I came to 10X, when I come to any time I speak, I'm going to do a lot of presentations. I'm looking at what are they trying to do right now to get the result? They're here because they want to make money online. They're here because they want to grow their business. They're here trying to do whatever. I'm just trying to prove to them that whatever thing they're trying to do to get that result sucks. And if I can make them that switch, then I got them 100% in. Line hook and sinker, is that what they say? And that's the key, okay? Opportunity to switch. Hopefully that makes sense to you guys. And this takes some thinking. Most of you guys are selling the improvement offer right now. That's why you're struggling. We're going to close 10%, 20%, 50%, 100%. Like you have to make an opportunity switch. You're switching them from this is how they're currently trying to get that result to this is the new opportunity. Thank you guys again for having me. I appreciate you. I cannot wait to 10X your companies next 12 months. Thank you everybody.
