Right now it's gonna be amazing, but I think what would be even more amazing is if... So, here's the story. I've been working and slaving for the last three months planning Funwaki Live. People are like, you should just ask famous speakers. They're like, no, that's not how this works. Funwaki Live is the only event where there's like, storylines from the beginning to the end. Everything builds upon each other. And every year I spend so much time freaking out on who we're gonna ask, why we're gonna ask them, what order they need to be in. It's a vicious even more, because we have a big announcement coming but it all has to weave together for this one moment where we're gonna like reveal everything. The only problem is I haven't asked anybody yet. So if any of them say no, it throws off the entire event. So we're gonna start calling people. And the way I'm gonna do it, we have the new Funnel Live, except for the speakers we have the big sales video. I'm gonna pretend like I'm just getting their opinion on what's on the actual video. And they're like, yeah, then watch the video. They're like, oh my gosh, this is amazing. And then I'm like, the only thing I think we're missing is, I feel like on day two, if we had a session about this, when you taught, that would make this perfect. What do you think? And then they have a freak out. That's the plan. Here we go. Hey, really quick. So we just got done with the Funnel Live sales video. I set that sure opinion on something really quick. If you got time, that'd be insanely cool. Sarah, what's up? Hello. How you doing? What's up dude? Hey brother, how you doing? Hey man, what's going on? Hey. How's it going? Russell, bro. What's the face time, me? Oh my gosh. Well, well, well. Hey man. What up bro? No way. Russell. Hey. What's up Russell? What's up dude? Yo, what's up man? Right at the top. Look at that. Oh yeah. Look at that. Yeah, you got it. Are you hungry? What's up bro? So what did you think about the video? Incredible. I loved it, I got chills. I heard your messaging on that is like, swollen. Dude, for someone who hates talking on the phone, you're face timing with like in person. Is this recording this one? Oh. Hello. Hey, is McCall there? There's no name McCall here. I'm a hospice checkup, but how can I help you? I must have the wrong number then. Hold on. Who is this? This is Russell. Hi Russell. Oh, I didn't get wrong. Sorry about that. Yeah, it's okay. All right, have a great day. I totally just called the wrong number. I'm so embarrassed. I'm trying to get it. Oh, it's you this time. I literally called and it's this old lady. I thought it maybe was your mom and it was really awkward. And she's like, so what's your name, sweetie? I'm like, why are you answering your face time with some crazy persons calling? She probably doesn't get that many calls. Okay, so my opinion I wanted to ask you then. So playing out the schedule for Hacking Live. And I feel like on day two, there's this spot where people, I think could learn charisma hacking and it would be amazing. I think you could change people's lives. So my questions, you'd be interested in speaking at Funnel Hacking Live this year. Are you serious? I'm dead serious. Yes, I love you. Yes. Let me think about it. Yes. And then maybe you can be in the video for next year. What do you think? Are you kidding me? I'm dead serious. You want to speak at Funnel Hacking Live? Oh my gosh, I'm excited. Girl, are you serious? I'm dead serious. What do you think? 100% man, I am. So that was my evil motivation is to get you in the moment. Dude, wow man, yeah, dude, that would be an honor. Oh, like me on there? Heck yeah. Oh, hey man. That would be honored, absolutely. Oh, she's dancing. Oh, that was... I'm feeling that's my ear. I was like, this is how you're gonna be the coolest thing or the meanest thing that's ever happened. I was like, it was FaceTime 70 to ask their feedback on a video. Oh my gosh, I can't believe it. Yes, I like you. If it helps you, it helps me, bro. That's my answer to you every time. I would be honored to be there and speak on whatever this guy... I want to throw at you guys. Yeah, no, yeah, a dream come true. So I was curious to be mentioned speaking to this year's Funnel Hacking Live. I think she said no, maybe we're just... I didn't hear, she's not said no, so... I didn't say no, I didn't say no. I said yep. I love getting their reactions. They're just like...
