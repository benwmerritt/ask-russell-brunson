What's up everybody? This is Russell. Welcome back to the podcast, exactly hanging out with you guys today. We're leading up to Funalaki Live. I am like neck deep in presentations and everything. And so I'm creating all these presentations. As I'm thinking about stuff, like I have all these ideas that flood my head that don't have to do my presentations. I'm like, what do I do with these? And I'm like, podcast. So I'm going to jump into this episode and give you guys something that once again is it's almost like the the byproduct of the mass thinking about things for presentations and then it's kind of like the it's like cutting wood and there's a sawdust on the side. So here's some sawdust. Hopefully it'll be valuable and I think it'll be awesome for you guys. But I've been thinking a lot about it in a couple of different areas of my life, my business, my life, my family, my relationships, a lot of them places that this concept comes in. I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard this before, but the concept, I'll talk about the, I'll give you the title and the concept and where it comes from. And then from there, we'll dive deep into the like all the stuff behind it, how we can use it to have better lives, make more money, have more success, all kinds of stuff like ties together. So so the concept is called the law of the harvest. Now yes, move is a lot of the harvest. You think about this is pretty simple. Conceptually, it's like you go out there and you're you've got a farm or you've got something right in yours, like your planting seeds, your planting seeds, if you plant seeds, what happens over time they grow and then you can reap what you what you sowed right you sow the seeds and you can reap them. In fact, in the scriptures and second Corinthians 96, it says he which sow a sparingly shall also reap sparingly and he which sowed bountifully shall reap also bountifully. Okay. So that's the concept is like if you want to go out there and you know, again, I'm not a farmer, I'm from Idaho, so I see farmers, but if they go out there and they only sow a couple seeds, they'll get some crops around very much, right? But if they sow a lot of seeds, then they have a big crop and they can they can take it, they can sell it, they can make a lot of money, right? And so I've been thinking about this law of the harvest because it's true in like literally almost every area of our life. If you think about this, like all of our life, everything we're doing right now is like outputs of something we've done prior, right? And it's like, if you're in a spot in your life where you didn't plant seeds for a long time, then right now you're a spot where maybe you're not reaping what you would want to, right? Or maybe you've been like, you've been planting seeds like crazy for last year, two years, five years, a decade of your life, and now you're starting to reap the benefits of that, right? I think about myself like when I got into this business, you know, you guys have all heard me talk about my potato, potato gun story, right? Back then I was like planting seeds and planting seeds and there's literally the thing popped up and there was a potato gun DVD, potato gun funnel, and they've been making me a lot of money. There's a little seed, right? But I didn't stop there. I kept planting seeds and planting seeds and planting seeds, right? And some of you guys have seen the slide deck where I talk about this, but like it was like 100 and came around. It was almost 130 different funnels I launched before ClickFunnels. 130 seeds that I had put out there before ClickFunnels that came out, right? It wasn't just seeds of like funnels I was launching. It was also like relationships. I was getting to know people, networking and building relationships and talking to people and helping them and promoting them and blah, blah, blah. Right? It's planting all these seeds. So when ClickFunnels came about, we had a big following. I had people I could connect with who would promote ClickFunnels. And so it all came down to like, to this planting of seeds, right? And there's interesting, I see parts of my business, parts of my life that are drying up now and I'm looking back in hindsight, I'm like, ah, it's because I stopped planting. Like a good example that like we have a new offer coming out and I was like, I want to get a bunch of fillets to help me promote it. And I was like, I haven't talked to my affiliates in a couple of years. Like I planted seeds for a decade building relationships, right? Eventually I passed the, those reins onto Dave Woodward. He was planting seeds and then Dave passed. Nobody's really been been planting those seeds. And so now it's like I'm coming three years later. I'm like, ah, like the harvest isn't there. So it's like, okay, I got to start planting seeds right now. What kind of start planting seeds as many places as possible to start building that relate those relationships again, right? So a lot of the harvest is interesting. And I'm going to talk about a lot of ways we can use this to grow and be successful in parts of our life. But I want to talk about like, first off, the main reason why, why this works, right? And you guys know, I'm mildly obsessed with everything related to the subconscious mind. All the books I'll read are all about that. I recently bought subconscious.com for a really fun project that I'm going to be working on with Annie Grace. Let me just know her. She's one of our ClickFunnels funnel hacking members. But it's interesting because think about subconscious mind, right? Like if you look at our lives, like we come into this world and we have a blank slate, right? And then over time, we start building these habits, these patterns. And unfortunately it starts when we're little kids and we don't know what's happening. We just like all these things in our environment are happening. So it's building these patterns in our subconscious mind. Now most people live and die not ever knowing about this. And they're just on autopilot and their lives are dictated based on stuff that happened with their little kids, right? But for us, it's like we understand that's like our job is to start reprogramming our subconscious mind. How do you do that? Think about it. If you think about the law of the harvest, right? For years, sometimes decades, you're planting seeds, you didn't even know, right? Things are coming into your mind, it could be from music, from family, from movies, from kids, from people at school, whatever, these seeds are all being planted and the harvest is growing. And now you're wherever you are today and you already have this thing. And and the seeds that have been planted, you're like you're harvesting. Somebody's just not good. Maybe your health's not good. Maybe your mind says not good. Maybe your business isn't good. It's all because of these seeds that were sown earlier in your life. Now you're in the spot where you're kind of on the other side of that, right? And so it's interesting. And so a couple of things, oh, there's a really, really cool quote from, I don't have a quote in front of me, but Elsie Lincoln Benedict, my favorite author, one of my favorite authors, she's amazing. But she wrote about this in her book, How to Get Anything You Want, which we were republishing soon when she has a love. But she she talked about how like, like, how do you how do you stop those negative things? And she's like, well, number one is just stop watering them. What's happening is that we've been planting seeds forever. We have all these habits that are happening, but we keep watering with our beliefs, our thoughts, our ideas. And so if you stop, if you stop watering, they'll start shivering and dying, right? So part of it's like, just stop, we have to stop planting the seeds if we don't want it to keep growing. And number two, then is which starts focusing like, what are the seeds we want to plant to get the outcome we want, right? We got a reverse engine. Here's the outcome I want, and what are the seeds we're going to plant? Okay, I'm going to go deeper in that here in a minute, but I want to step back because the first time I learned this was wrestling. Wrestling is like my first love. It's the first thing I had success within life. And I never knew these things consciously. And although my coach is in, but we did these things, right? It's how I became a successful wrestler. A lot of you guys know when I was wrestling, I started in eighth grade by junior year, I want to stay title. My senior year, I took second place in the country, went on college and wrestling college. And wrestling for me was like such a perfect training program for me to understand like how to have success, my mindset, my brain. Because what would happen is you'd come into practice every day, right? And it was literally like us planting seeds like crazy, right? And we had to plant seeds in a lot of different ways. We had to plant seeds like I had to be in cardio vascular shape, right? So if I wasn't planting seeds for my cardio, right, I would reap bad cardio in a match, right? And no, I guess never wrestle. If you haven't ever wrestled, imagine this in high school at six minutes in college is seven. But for me to wrestle six minute match, like you have to, you have to be insane type of shape to be able to do that. A good example, when I was wrestling in Boise State, so I was in college, every day before practice, what we would do is we'd get to the school, we'd put on our running shoes, we'd go outside and we'd run with the cross country team, right? So we do the cross country running practice, right? Planting cardio seeds, then practice would get done, then we'd go to the stadium football stadium, put the guys in our backs, we'd go up and down the stairs, up and down the stairs, up and down the stairs to build like, again, our lungs, our endurance stuff like that. And at that time, the cross country would be done with their practice. They would go home and then we would go in and we would start wrestling practice. Okay. Wrestlers are built differently. We're a little bit crazy. So I had to plant cardio seeds like crazy to have cardio energy, right? I don't know if that makes sense, but I had to plant the seeds of cardio to be able to have that cardio energy when I needed it in the middle of a match, right? Number two, strength, right? Like I had to plant strength seeds. And so every single morning we'd get up, it's, I think it was six a.m. We'd be there at six a.m. to the gym, all the wrestlers together, and we'd get there to the boys' weight training facility. We all lifted together. So planting seeds, okay? Because if I, you can't just like, end the season like, I need muscles, like, I'm gonna go work out. You know, it's all about planting seeds for years, decades leading up to planting seeds. So I'd have this strength. So I had cardio seeds, strength seeds, right? Then it comes in now. It's like, now I got to start doing the moves. And what's interesting, what I learned, I had a coach tell me this, I can't remember who it was, but definitely they were genius. But we go into practice and we practice things, right? Practice over. And like, again, practice like planting these seeds or creating these like subconscious patterns inside of, inside of our mind. I mean, it's crazy. I don't have to stab in front of me, but like our consciousness, if I consciously, if I'm wrestling, I see a move. If I consciously go for the move, that's one thing. But if I can, if I drill my subconscious, we're subconsciously, I see the movement, I just hit it. I think our subconscious, if I came around the stab, it's like a hundred extra, a thousand times faster, right? And so what's happening in a match, I'm consciously, oh, there's the guy's leg. By the time I shoot, the guy's leg is gone. Because it's all like, it's just fast, fast, fast, right? So I had to drill something so many times that my subconscious mind just feels it in a second. It's over and boom, I hit the shot. I take it. If I had to think for, if I think for a half a second, I already missed the shot. Right? So it's like, we drill over and over and over and over and over and over again. Right? And then I remember after a couple of years in wrestling, I kept missing these shots. My head was out of position. I couldn't get things right. And one of my coaches says something. He said, Russell, you realize we're in every single day practicing. He's like, but practice does not make perfect. Like, what are you talking about? He's like, no, it's like perfect practice makes perfect. If you're practicing the thing wrong over and over and over and over again, you can get it wrong. And we started looking at my moves and literally it was like, and wrestling, it's all about, it's a game of like millimeters, right? Like, my shooting my head directly into their thing versus like to the side of my ear on the side, like, I have my head in the wrong position, having like not stepping in the right spot, like hips, hips in the wrong spot, shoulders, elbows are like little tiny things. And so we got back to like in practicing, it wasn't like going practicing hard. It was like, okay, I got to, I got to get perfect practice, right? Like, I got to figure out like perfect positioning. And so we start drawing slower and slower. It's like planting these seeds, planting a seed, like, like building a subconscious patterns over and over and over and over again, right? Until the point where it's like, okay, now I can start going faster and faster. The point now is like, I can go really, really fast. And it's all perfectly because it's like I'm practicing so many, so many times, right? We build these subconscious patterns inside of our mind. And then what happens is if you've done that correctly, then you go out in the match, right? I shake the person's hand and as soon as the whistle blows for me, everything stops. Like my conscious mind stops. And all of a sudden this flurry starts happening. It's all subconscious. And it's the craziest thing. Like, I don't even know how to explain it. Because like, think about this, you're in an arena with all the 10,000 people screaming, matches everywhere, whistles being blown, it's like loud, noisy. You come out there, so they shake someone's hand, boom. They're also like, it just everything faded to black. And this match just happened. And I'm not thinking it's just doing, right? It's just happening. And it's all my subconscious is just like, we've drilled those instincts so many times, they knew what to do, when to do it, how to do it, how to respond, how to rate in every situation you think of. And it's funny because they talk about that like athletes and other sports talk about like you get in the zone. And that's what it feels like when your subconscious is trained correctly, you get in the zone and just happens. It's just like the most magical thing in the world. And for me, it was interesting because like every time I get in bad position or something bad would happen, I get stuck. And my subconscious did not react. All of a sudden, like my ears would turn on and I could hear either my dad or my coach, I knew their voices, I could hear their voices, speaking consciously, like, move your leg, move your arm. And I'm like, Oh, and also like, I know, and then boom, I snap back in and it was just gone again into the same. And so like that's, I love sports because I was able to see it, right? And so these, these, these seeds were planning of drilling the move over, oh, like tens of thousands of times, every move, every position, every angle, everything. So you just knew what to do and how to do and how to respond in these different situations, right? And that's like the power of like subconscious programming, understanding how to do this, right? It is so fun. And so for me, it's like, I think about this, like what we're, what we're trying to do is we're trying to plant these seeds, but you're planning them consistently over time. So they just show up and you need them, right? So again, back to the scripture, he who sow a sparingly also reaps sparingly. So if you're not sowing these seeds, if you do that every once in a while, a little dabbling here and there, you're going to reap sparingly. And he who sowed bountifully shall reap also bountifully. So those who were doing it consistently all the time will reap bountifully, right? If I just did cardio once a week, my lungs would have been in a handle on the match. If I just were lifted, you know, every once or twice a week, the, the, the strength I needed would not have showed up for me, right? Like that's the, that's the key to understand. And so the law of the harvest, we got to be planting consistently based on what we need to do. Okay. Now again, this is not just in wrestling or just in business, but it's all the aspects of life. And so I kind of mapped out three different steps. Um, the after really to be able to do this correctly, uh, the things that most people are missing. And so I'm going to walk through those three steps and I'm going to talk about how we do this in different areas of our life, because the honest realities were just planning seeds in one area of our life, right? Like right now in my life, I'm planning seeds with my wife and planning seeds with my family and planning seeds with my business, planning seeds with my health, planning seeds with my mindset and planning seeds with like future goals, future plans, like future businesses, like I'm planning a lot of different seeds. And so you have to have a process for it. Otherwise it's just sporadic. And then you're like, oh, I have a sparingly over here, but not enough here. And they, now my marriage is falling apart. And now this is crushing versus like, okay, how do we come up with a strategy where we can plant seeds correctly in all different places so that, um, my life becomes what I want. So I can reap a bountifully all the different areas of my life. Okay. And it all comes down to sewing because again, wherever you're in your life right now, it's, and this is, I hate saying this because sometimes people can be like, Oh, well, um, you know, you're sitting, I, I saw people, like some of you guys listening and be like, well, that's not true for me, but it's true. Even my life, I'm looking at things, I'm struggling right now 100% of every situation I'm struggling in my life right now is because I wasn't planning seeds before. So wherever you are today, it's about seeds you planted a year ago, five years ago, 10 years ago is, it's gotten you a spot you are right now. So now I want to make you hyper aware of it. You're like, okay, I need to stop watering the seeds that are taking away from what I want. And what are the seeds I need to consistently plant? Okay. So here's the steps, right? Step number one, you've got to pick a strategy. And this is the key because, um, I see people who just go start planning seeds, but they don't have a strategy. And so this is almost worse because then you're doing all sorts of different things, right? Um, you got to be able to have a strategy that works. Um, and also notice that a strategy, not multiple strategies, right? So if you know the things you like to want to have success with, and what I recommend you is like, I don't know, I'm such a big believer in finding mentors and coaches, like find a mentor or find a coach, whoever that is in that area, and then put on blinders, just focus on what they say. Okay. There's probably five ways you can build a business and 20 ways you can get in health, you know, you can, you can lose weight. In fact, I'm as guilty as ever. No, so I got Instagram. I love following all the people who were like the hardcore foodie people who are like, look, they have the abs and big old muscles and they're following stuff. And one guy's like, Oh, I'm all whole foods. One guy's paleo. One guy's keto and one guy's carnivore. One guy's vegetarian. They're like, they're all, all the, all the dudes look ripped. They look awesome. I want to look like all of them, right? But I'm like, if I'm doing them, okay, here's the vegetarian guy. Here's the carnivore right here. I'm trying to like plant all the receipts. Do you see how it doesn't work? In fact, it's funny because if I was to try to do like all five of the cool diets by all five guys, it ends up being like, even if I'm like, Oh, I'm just some, some, some vegetables from over here and some meat from over here and some this, this, like ends up being like 35,000 calories a day and you get that. Okay. You don't look like any of those guys. Okay. I got to pick one of them and then focus on. I don't care which one is the pick one. Okay. You want to be a vegetarian? Cool. Follow the vegetarian guy. It looks like the way you look. You want to be a carnivore? Cool. Find the carnivore that looks the way you like, like find the person who's doing what you want and then put on blinders and follow them. Okay. And then system was picking the right strategy and by strategy, I'll say AKA coach, like find that person, right? And then finding this in all areas of life in your relationship, who's got a really successful relationship that you envy? You're like, Oh, I wish it was like that. Okay. Find the server. What do they do? Figure it out, hire and pay them whatever it is, right? Same thing in your business and your traffic generation in your like, your mindset, like it's the same thing like picking the right strategy. Okay. And then shutting down all the rest. You just focus on one for each area of life. Sorry, you can have multiple strategies, but there's one for health, one for relationships, et cetera, et cetera. Right. Okay. So step number one is picking the strategy. Step number two now, here's where we start the planting of seeds. Okay. Planting of seeds are all about figuring out the habit. It's funny on the video version of this. I got a Russell Brunson face in the background. So like the camera keeps making that the center of my face blurs out and it's like my background is on focus and back and forth. So I'm back on the camera for all my people on YouTube watching this. Okay. Step number two are habits. So what are habits? Habits are the planting of seeds. Habits are all the things you do that are habitual. Meaning it happens over and over and over and over again. Can you guys know this? Right. So now that I figure, okay, here's the strategy. Right. So for example, for me in my life, like I wanted to get closer to Christ. Like that was a big thing this year for me. It's like, I feel like I've fallen away. I haven't been planting the seeds. They're from not harvesting. Like how do I have a relationship? How do I understand him? How do I all kinds of stuff? Right. So for me, it's like, Hey, what are the habits I need to implement into my daily routine? They're going to be planting the seeds consistently and constantly, constantly, consistently throughout this year, so I can reap the fruit of it in the future. Right. That's the question. By the way, there's a really cool app we created. It's free. If you go to what'smymorningroutine.com, you can use this to like plug in your thing. That's what I do. Right. So I go to what'syourmorningroutine.com. It gives you a calendar of the week and I'm like, Okay, every morning if I, if the strategy I want, the strategy I want is I'm going to read from these two books every single day. They're going to get me closer to Christ. I need at least 30 minutes a day to do that. So I got to find out in my calendar, how do I, how do I plug in this thing into the like hard coded into the DNA of my day so that habitually every single day I'll be planting that seed so that I can, I can reap it in the future. Okay. So that's number one. Okay. And then I'm like, Okay, what's next thing? Okay, I want to get, I want to be healthy. Okay. So for me, it's like, I've got two sides of how I got like, I've got, well, I guess there's a couple of sides like nutrition. There is the like weightlifting, I love weightlifting and there's the cardio. Okay. So for me, it's like, okay, who get who am I? Who's the who's my guy or my gal? Who's the person I'm, I'm putting on blindness for nutrition. Who's the person for weightlifting? Who's the person over here? Right. So I have those different things. And then I come back and I need to habitually do this on the way to do that is actually plug it into my morning routine. There is. Okay, I'm back. So I'm a camera keys focusing on anyway, sorry, a D rustle. I'm back. Okay. So I go back to my morning routine. So okay, if I'm going to do this, what, okay, nutritionally, what am I eating? So in my, in my, what's my morning routine.com, I go out plugging here's right. Take the supplements. Here's what supplements I take. I take in the morning, afternoon, night. I plug that all in. Now it's happened. It's hard coding my day. You cannot be, cannot be taken away. Now those seeds are planted every single day. Okay. Then then my, my muscles, okay, which day is my lift and lifting here, here, here, I hard code that into my daily routine. Boom. Now, now it's happening. I can't, I can't move it. Right. Then it's like, okay, now I need cardio for me. Only cardio is wrestling. So where am I plugging in wrestling? I plug those things in. Right. I got into wrestling. I swore I would never run again. Um, and then I gained like 40 pounds. So I do some, but I try to make all my cardio wrestling because I love wrestling and it's fun versus like all the other things. So anyway, but then I come back, plug it in, hard coded in, right? And those habits are, are into my more, into the routine. And now that I can start planting those seeds habitually and over time, they are going to bring forth fruit. Okay. Mindset, where I get my mindset training. Okay. Where are the books I'm reading? Where, where does that fit into the schedule? If I don't plug in the schedule and hard code it, not going to happen. So I hard coded in through prayer of the books. Boom. Now my mindset. Okay. Now I need to get generate leads every day. What does that look like for me? Okay. Well, for me, I got to do very certain things. Like I got to, um, I got to do content. Like I have to do this podcast. Right. For me, we're publishing two podcasts a week. Seems I need to record for a week, right? To get ahead of it. So I got to figure out. So for me, every single day, uh, there's certain time I block out, okay. Russell's doing a podcast. I got a lock. I lock out of time and it makes it happen. Right. Every single day, hard coded in, planting the seeds, plant seeds over time, consistently over time. Boom. It's going to grow. You too. How do you Instagram? How do I do this? I figure out all the things there. Okay. Customer fulfillment. How'd they call my customers? Be happy. How does that look? Okay. I got to show up. So when I showed up over here, I'm doing live trains over here. I'm doing this like, right. So I'm starting taking all the things, all the strategy to figure it out. I got to turn them into habits. Right. And I got to plug them into my actual routine, into my schedule so that consistently I am actually planting those seeds. Otherwise, what happens? We have good intentions. Right. The, the road to when they say the road to hell is paved and good attention. I was going to, I was going to get in shape. I was going to diet. I was going to read the scriptures. I was going to do like, we have all these things we were going to do, right? And to be successful. It's not the way we were going to do. It's like, it's, it's figuring out what's the strategy, plugging it into the routine. So it's habitual. So that planting of that seed happens every single day. Right. And that's step number two. I think about it's wrestling. Like in wrestling, my coach is luckily dictated my, not so much in high school, but in college, my coach has dictated every minute of my life. Right. So I knew this and they knew that here's the seeds we have to plant that are going to reap bountifully the results we want as an athlete. Okay. So they hard coded it. So I didn't have a choice, but this was happening. Mindset, nutrition, diet, or strength training, cardio, wrestling, practice, all the things were blocked in there and there's a little block in the middle for school. Right. Everything else is in there. So they were making sure that we were sowing our seeds every single day. Right. I think that's for most people, they don't do that though. Like there's a time when you're young and your parents make you do it. And then there's this transition point. And I was lucky for me. Like I had, I had multiple things that forced me to plug in. Right. I went on a mission for my church for two years. Boom. They gave me a schedule and it was all, all of the, the time blocks were blocked in where I was going to be habitually planting seeds to be able to harvest where I wanted. Right. And it just happened. Right. When I got done, or we got done with my mission, I was, I was wrestling college. Boom. Same kind of thing. And then after I got into wrestling, I got married and it was like freedom. Like we didn't have anything. So for years, my wife and I were just like having fun. It was great. But guess what? I gained 40, 45 pounds. I wasn't making money. Like all the things like I was not planting seeds. We had a good time. But we never had a chance to reap down a flee. Right. We were reaping sparingly. And what the income for me, it was honestly, we decided to go to 20 Robbins event and he lit us on fire. It was like, okay, I'm stepping up. Like I gotta get back to where it was when I was, you know, when I was the peak of my mission, the peak of my, uh, my athletic crew. Like there was a time when I was an athlete. I'm like overweight now. Like I want to be an athlete again. Okay. How do I become an athlete? I gotta get back to sowing the seeds that create an athlete. Right. Cause I had been sowing so uh, sparingly that there was nothing to pull up from it. Right. So that's how it works. Okay. So step number one, you got to pick a strategy. Step number two, you got to make it habitual. You got to tie in and create habits around all the things that you are trying to do, all the seed planting you need to do. And for me, I don't know, for me personally, it's like first thing in the morning, end of the day and like lunch hours, right? Tie in the habitual things, right? And then that big watch time and two right? I can do whatever I want or I need to do. And everything else is happening is blocked in. Right. And so that's kind of how I do mine. All right. Step number three then is figuring out like, where are you going to actually apply this stuff? Okay. And again, there's a lot of places you can do it for, for all you guys. It's going to be different, but um, I would recommend different areas of life picking things, right? So I wrote down a list of a bunch of them to think about. Number one is got to be your mindset. Okay. Think about this. Your, your subconscious mind is in program. It's right now you're coming here. You're trying to stop watering the old seeds, cutting down the grass and start planting those new seeds. It's the first thing begins like, okay, how am I going to consist constantly and consistently be planning these habitual seeds into my mindset? Right. And so for me, uh, it's all about like, you really say like you, you are the average of your five closest friends, right? Your, your revenues, the average five closest friends, your weights going to be the, the, the average, your five closest friends. I'm a big believer in that. Right. So the reason why is because we have our conscious mind, right? That it's kind of like it's standing guards, like the central of our brain. So it's taking things and like, whatever, um, it allows to get your subconscious mind will be programmed. So for me, it's like, if I want to fix my mindset, number one, I have to make sure that the things I'm inputting that I've been consciously choosing to listen to, to watch are going to be the right thing for me. Right. So for me, it's like, um, I listened to a lot of podcasts and the purpose of the podcast is not for me to, uh, not supposed to give me like more strategies. That's not what I'm trying to do. Cause a lot of people get overwhelmed. Cause like, oh, listen, this guy's podcast and this, I'm trying to do this and they're trying to do all sorts of stuff. Like for me, it's like, no, I have a plan. I'm not deviating from my plan. I know what it is. It's structured. It's like, this is the plan. I'm listening to podcasts because I'm trying to, um, have the mindset of the people that I'm following, wear off into my subconscious mind. Okay. For a decade plus of my life, I listen to Dan Kennedy every day. The reason, because the way he thought about marketing was different than anybody else in the world. I needed my subconscious mind to start thinking like Dan. It wasn't like everything, Dan, so I'm taking note of what we're going to do. And I just, I just listened to tell stories over and over and over and over and so I got to start thinking like Dan Kennedy. Okay. I started finding other people like Tony Robbins, Tom Bill, you like other people I really enjoyed Napoleon Hill. Like I listened to those things, not so much that I'm trying to add something new to my, to my, to my, um, my to-do list or new str- you know, more so for me, it's just like, I'm trying to get into their minds. I want to hear them tell stories. You know, hear them figure out how they, they solve problems because the more I do that, the more it brains like, Oh, well this is what Dan wanted done. So Tony, what he does is easy, right? Okay. Cause I want to get around us. So for me, mindset is all about like finding the podcast, the books and things of that. The people that, that I respect the way their brain works and I want my brain to work more like that. And my whole job is that these are seed planting. There's planting seeds all day long, try to figure out so that I've got a stronger mindset so I can dominate what I need to. Okay. All right. Number two is your health. Your health functions like, I didn't realize this tell again, here's Russell's, here's Russell's history and timeline. I was a little kid, started wrestling, got really good at wrestling. Won a state title, took second place nation, went to college, got awesome, uh, through the top 10 in college, never placed unfortunately. And then, um, and then my, my senior graduated, my wife got pregnant. Boom. She gave 50 pounds. I gained 50 pounds and she had twins. She lost 50 pounds. I stayed 50 pounds overweight and for eight years I was overweight, right? And I was building my business. I didn't know though, like, cause for yourself, you feel the same. You feel like more, I felt more tired and stuff. But I didn't realize like the negatives of it, right? I didn't care about being healthy, right? And then, um, I don't know. I went to a couple of wrestling practices and I was just like, Oh, I remember going back to rest to, to a Boise State to go wrestle and coach had me wrestle the heavyweight. So I was like, what? I'm like, no, I'm a 165 out. And it's like, not anymore. I walked in with the guys and he was like, bro, what happened to your face? I'm like, what are you talking about? It's like, you're double chin. Like your face is huge. I'm like, Oh, I had no idea. Right. And so I finally I was like, okay, I gotta get my health under control. And I tried a bunch of things, but nothing really works. So finally when I actually hired a coach, uh, his name is Sean Carlson. In fact, he's my coach again right now. Hired him, started going three days a week, go to work out, train, ran, lifted, all kinds of stuff. Right. And then in, I don't know, 10 month period time, I went from, I can't write 30% body fat down to, I think I broke double digits. If not, it was like 10, 10 or 11, maybe 9% but somewhere down there. Right. And then the craziest thing happened to me. Okay. What I was not expecting. I thought it was like, I was going to look awesome, which I was excited about that. What I was not expecting happening is that I was not tired during the day. I didn't realize like, how like the extra weight on me made me tired, sluggish. Right. And when I lost the weight, I had more energy. I can keep going. I can get twice, two, three, four, five times more stuff than the day than the average person. It was insane. I was like, this is a cheat code. Like being healthy is a cheat code to making money because, because what you can get done in a day, I can get done in two hours. And I got five of those, eight of those a day. Right. And so like, it was huge for me. So I understand you like your health is a big important part, especially if you want to make money. But even if you don't, like, like it's, it's just, it's key. So it's like, Hey, how am I going to fix my health? Okay. And again, I could teach a whole book on this, but there's different levels. Like number one is like, you got to get, you got to get control of your caloric intake. Like if you don't know how many calories you need every single day, like that's number one, right? You got to know because the size of your, like how big you are is all based on how many calories you're taking. Like that's number one. I had no idea. So I went and figured out, um, in fact, it was Hermosie back and they showed me the, the mathematical formula to figure that out. But you got to figure out how many calories and the key is like tracking it for like a month or two months or three months. Like every type of food in your mouth, go to like one of the health trackers and type in it and it'll show you how many calories that you're eating because you probably don't know. Okay. So number one is like getting that under control to figure out. Okay. Here, like, because how big you are is 100% based on calories and calories out. For sure. Okay. So that's separate one separate two with health then, um, is then figuring out how macros work, right? Fat, proteins, carbs, they got some next rabbit hole to go down, right? So after you've got your calories under control, now it's like, okay, now I want to like look differently. Right. Cause you can have your calories are controlled to be really skinny or being really muscular. Like, and that depends on your fat, uh, your fat protein, um, uh, carb ratio, right? How are you going to do that? So that's phase number two is like figuring out the ratios that you want for the body type you want, right? We want to be a bodybuilder, cool, way more protein. You want to be skinny, you want to run forever, cool, you need to do carbs. Like that's cool. There's a lot of ways to do it, but it's figuring out like, again, what strategy do you actually want for your health? Right. And then third phase is, so it's like how you, how you look like overweight, underweight is like calories, right? And then like the type of body is, uh, is the macros and third is how you actually feel, which is the quality of food you put in, right? And now shifting from like eating garbage, even though it fits my caloric intake, like, I'm a really nutrient dead food. Also like feel better too. It's insane. It's insane. So those are things like, I'd be, there's some, maybe I'll do a podcast just deeper on just that specifically, but just some things that think there's like, here's how you get your health under control. Those are the phases I look at. Okay. All right. I will transition to business stuff a little bit, right? So business, um, this is the interesting cycle in most business owners. What this will happens, right? They get in the world, they start focusing on building a list, building leads that are getting leads, they create a product, they sell it, they make much money, like, ah, that's amazing. And then they have this existing list, right? And they sell another product, another product, another product. And over time that list will atrophy and it'll shrink, get smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller, so eventually their business is struggling. And they come to me and they're like, Russell, I'm, I used to have to make so much money back near, but now I'm not, I can't figure it out. Like it doesn't make sense. I'm doing the same things I used to do. I'm like, are you now? And then, uh, and they'll tell me like, yeah, I have a list. I sell stuff to them and like they used to always buy, but now they don't buy anymore. Like, how did you build this? Like, oh, when I first got started, I was focusing on, you know, YouTube videos and podcasts, all sorts of, to build my list. I'm like, cool, how much stuff do you now? They're like, well, I don't, I don't do any of that now. Like I have a list. Like I just sell stuff to them. I'm like, ah, see, there you go. What's happening today in your life is because you, is because of the seeds you planted a year ago, two years ago, three years ago. Okay. Most of the time when people come to my world and their business is struggling, it's because they stopped planting the seeds of lead generation, lead flow. It's crazy. Or I see people who are sitting here building a funnel, building a course and their folks, the all sorts of stuff, and they haven't started planting seeds that actually matter, which is the seeds of getting lead flow. Okay. The second you decide you're going to build a funnel, the second you decide to be an entrepreneur, you got to start planting those seeds, which means you got to start publishing now. If you write traffic secrets, what's the first thing I said? Like you got to start publishing today. Don't wait till tomorrow. Like today, like if you're building a funnel, stop right now. Step from what is publishing, getting something out there today. You can do Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, podcasts. I don't care. But it's getting your message out there. So you're following, you start following you. Because the worst case scenario is you spend two years, three years building a funnel and a product that you want it and there's nobody there to see it. Okay. Planting seeds now. Okay. The next worst thing is like people who got a business that's struggling now. It's like, I can't figure out. It's like, you stop planting seeds. Okay. Go back to driving traffic. If you're not always consistently like the lifeblood of your company is leads. If you're consistently every day focused on getting new blood, new people into your world, your body, your business will deteriorate and it will die. Okay. What happens if your blood runs out, you die. Like lead flow is the blood of your business. So step number one is you got to start. Okay. A lot of you guys have different phases. Let me just like, I'm learning to step on reading the book. So cool. The second you're a chapter one of the book, you should start publishing. Like you need to, you need to go. It's time to start. Like we need to stop stopping, right? And start going through it. So that's number one. It's like, you got to start like, planning those seeds. Okay. And so if you're building a business, habitually got a plugin. Okay. I got started driving traffic today, even though I know my business will be live in a month, about three months to six months now. Like if you know it's coming someday, planning seed starts today. Okay. And for lead flow. Very, very important. Okay. Man, there's so many, like, yeah. So plugging that in, being part of it. And then just all the other parts of your business, right? Like, like every single day, putting in working funnels and traffic and like all the things. So I can go on like, a list like this forever and ever. I just mapped out a couple of them. I think those are the ones that habitually need to plug in, right? Mindset stuff, health stuff, lead flow, right? And then inside of that, now it's like, cool, now we're going to build a funnel and launch. Now we're going to fill the course launch. Now we're doing the event and launch. Now we're going to do like whatever. But like, those are the things that are going to make you successful over time. Okay. All right, I'm going to end where this started with the scripture, right? The law of the harvest. He which sow a sparingly shall reap also sparingly. He which sow a bountifully shall reap also bountifully. All right, guys, that's the key. If you want to be successful in this or any of your life, it's time to start. What do you do? Number one, figure out the strategy. Okay. So you're not just planting a rando seeds all over the place and like hoping for the best, right? No more random seeds. You're going to be planting the correct seeds in the correct order. Okay. Number two, you have to create the habits. How do you create the habits? Okay. You can do this with a pad of paper. You can go to what's your morning routine.com free app you guys want to. Okay. You go over there and you start mapping. Okay. Every single morning. This is what's happening. This is where I'm planting my seeds for personal development. Here's my planting my spiritual needs. Here's what I'm planting my physical seeds. Here's what I'm planting my food seeds. Here's what I'm planting my, my traffic generation. So these like I'm mapping those things out and then I habitually make it part of what you do every single day, day in and day out, day in and day out. That's how it becomes a habit. How does it magically just bubble up? Right? It comes when you scheduling it. When it's scheduled, it's on the calendar, then as I have it, then you actually do it. Okay. And then figuring out where the places you want to apply that to, right? Your mindset, your health, your lead flow. But again, it comes back to other things, your relationship. Where, like, how, where are you blocking out time with your spouse? Where are you planning those seeds? Where you blocking out time to your kids? Where are you planning those seeds? Where are you blocking out like all these different themes? I remember Garrett White, when I first started following him, this is the very beginning of Cliff Fultz journey, but he used to post every single day, like date. I was like, before he had the date, your wife podcast, but it was, it was like, I wish I could remember what he would say, but he always, he always like talk about date night, date night, date night, right? And then he feel good Garrett, like he talks about every single morning. He does his morning meditation and he's communicating with God and then he like texts his son and his kid and like, he's like texting, he's planting the seeds every single day. And you hear about the story told at one of the phone lines about a son who was a stranger, he hadn't heard from him in years. He's like, I said, I was texting him every day, every day, he didn't respond back to me for years. It was like plant seeds, plant seeds, plant seeds, and eventually turned his heart, they came back, became, became friends, right? But it's just from the constant consistent seed planting, we're planting the right seeds. Okay. If you're planting the wrong seeds or no seeds, what does it say? Right? He, he would sow as sparingly, so also re-expery. So you're planting your seeds or you're planting the wrong seeds. Okay. Our mind is, Earl, Michael talks about this in the strange of secrets. Like our mind is amazing. He's like, whatever you plant, it'll, it'll, it'll spring up. He's like, if you go and plant night seed, which is a poisonous plant, it'll spring up that, but if you go plant something amazing, it'll spring like, like, it doesn't care what you plant. All matters is that whatever you, you plant is going to grow. Right? So it's making sure we're planting the right things, right? And they were actually planted. Okay. And get he who sowed bountifully shall also read bountifully. So there's your thought for the day is what are you planting? What are you sowing? And are you sowing it bountifully, consistently, habitually, day in and day out? Because whatever is happening in your life today is a result of the seeds you planted a year ago. So what you want to happen in a year from now is all based on the seeds you're planting today. It needs to become the focus, thinking about it, talking about it, scheduling. So it actually happens.
