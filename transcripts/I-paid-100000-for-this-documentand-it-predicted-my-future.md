What's up everybody? Welcome back to The Vault. One of my favorite things I've ever found to share with you guys today. This is an issue of Success Magazine, but it's not any issue. It is the first issue ever. This is one of the most rare things I have and in my collection I've actually come across two. So actually I own two of these which is kind of crazy. The very first issue ever Success Magazine was December 1897. Success Magazine was, you think about like personal event was not a thing prior to Success Magazine. There were a couple people who got into personal development and success and things like that. The founder wrote this magazine, put it out there and this became the thing that like blanketed the country and was the introduction to personal development principles across America. It literally changed the landscape. It changed our country and it all started with this inaugural issue of Success Magazine. I've not read the whole thing because like how expensive and rare this is. I took it out and very carefully was trying to read all the different pieces and stuff. So I read a lot of it. Should I pull it out? You guys want to see what it looks like inside? Because it's definitely not like like the magazines of today. Although there are some really cool ads inside which is always exciting. But this is what it looks like. You guys can see it right there. Front cover we got Abraham Lincoln. I'll tell you guys that story here later. And again it's 10 cents back then for me. This is the art of how they design these. It's so beautiful. So if you look at this like again all the different ads for different products inside. But look at like how intense just the text and the copy and how much stuff they're they're talking about. So it's pretty intense to read one of these. It'd be equivalent of reading you know probably 150-200 page book. And they're published in this every single month. In fact the first 12 months of success they publish as monthly. And then after that for the next 52 weeks they actually publish it as a weekly. And I have been collecting every issue of success from 1897. And right now I have all but two of the issues. And I'm searching for them everywhere. So if you guys have one let me know. This right here this is the article where he goes deeper into Abraham Lincoln. It calls The Stepping Stones to The White House. And it's a really cool article. And then the back here obviously you have more of the ads. It's just fun seeing all the ads from back in the day. Like in fact a lot of the books I find is from looking at the ads from way back. And I'll find the ads and I'll go on eBay and try to find the thing they're selling. A lot of times I can find like the book series or the just the different things that were being sold in the back. It's always fun to try to see if I can find original copies of what was being advertised back in 1897. I'm aware of three copies of this out in the wild. And I have two of them. So I don't know exactly what would be. I bought both of these as part of a lot when I was buying somebody's entire library. The first person did know this was the first edition. And so in the pricing I spent like 2.5 million dollars buying his entire estate. The price that was listed for this inside of the estate was a hundred thousand dollars just for this one magazine. The second one though is a fascinating story because one of my friends, Dr. Joe Vitale, if you search my YouTube you'll see him. I bought his entire library and in his library there was a whole stack of a whole bunch of success magazines. And when he was selling to me he was flipping through and I saw this. I saw the corner and I was like wait a minute like I'm like can you take a picture of that moment right there? So he found took a picture and sent it to me. I was like he has no idea this is the first edition. And so I didn't tell him until after we closed the deal he shipped it all to me and I took a picture I'm like did you realize you had a first edition success magazine? He's like I had no idea. So this one I got the second one I got again part of buying an entire collection from somebody but they didn't know the value of the time. So I could sell this right now on the market for a hundred thousand dollars pretty easily and there'd be people lined up to buy it including me. The thing I love most about success magazine is actually the story of the founder's name's Orson Swet Martin. Almost nobody knows who he is. It's very rare since I've been talking about this. I'm like even the person who owns Success Magazine now is having a conversation. I'm like you know about Orson Swet Martin? He's like who's that? I'm like oh he's the guy who founded the magazine and he didn't know the story behind him. And his story is why I love this magazine so much. It's a story about resilience, a story about success and failure and it's something that is someday should be made like a blockbuster movie. I'm here to tell you guys the story so you do not forget the legend and the story of Orson Swet Martin. He was a guy, he was a business owner, he was trying a bunch of things, he was buying hotels and trying to start a business and somewhere along the line he found an old book in his attic. And this book and we'll probably do a YouTube video on this book in the future because it's a very important one but it was a book by Samuel Smiles called Self Help. It was the first ever personal development book ever written over in Europe. Somehow this book had found it into Orson Swet Martin's home. He found this book in the attic, he read it and it changed his life. Like he just understood personal development and success and all these different principles right? And he got so excited that he started like thinking about these things and he started writing, he wanted to write his own book. He spent 15 years writing a manuscript. When the 15 years is over it was about 5,000 pages that he had been writing this book. He was so excited to publish it and it was inside of one of the hotels that he owned and one night the hotel burned to the ground and the entire 5,000 page manuscript was gone. You think about most people what would happen if adversity hit you like that? Like you were writing a book for 15 years on Google Docs and then Google you know crashed or you lost Microsoft Word Doc or whatever it is right you lose like what would most people do? They would throw their hands up and like I'm out. Instead they said like the accounts of what happened he was like literally there in the ashes of this hotel realizing that his life's work had been destroyed and what he did that night is he walked over to the convenience store or whatever he bought a 25 set notebook and he tried really quickly to remember like what he had written before and started rewriting this book from memory because he wanted to bring what they call his dream book out to the world. So he spent the next however long rewriting this book and he published it and the book was called Pushing to the Front and he launched it out to the world and it became the number one best selling personal loan book of all time up to that point and it's credited like you look at all the presidents of the United States back then they all read it they quoted it Thomas Edison Henry Ford all these guys like like all the people back then read this book it wasn't just like some random guy like it was literally the first personal loan book really published here in America that had a big impact that was kind of first success and then after that shortly after is when he had this idea like how do I get these principles out to the world and that's when he came up for the idea was for Success Magazine and so a couple years later when he put this whole thing together and he printed the very first issue on December 1897 that's when the very first issue went went out and that's when this the success thing wasn't just a book that some people bought but it became a magazine across the entire country that everybody could actually read and it changed the landscape of America forever. When I first heard that story the first time I look at so many people in my world and in my life myself a lot of times as well where it's like you hit an obstacle and the obstacle stops us right I mean I just think about like I don't know how much work it was for me to write my books on Google Docs right where it was like it's not that difficult I can cut and paste like back then in the early 1900s or sorry late 1800s to write a book like it's typewriters this manual is cutting and pasting handwritten stuff like the amount of work going into some of that and then to have it gone and just lost like most people would just walk away right but there's something about when someone's got a vision or a dream that's so much bigger than themselves like it doesn't matter what the obstacle it doesn't matter how big it is like you would push through that and again that's where most people fail I think about that a lot of times like I've seen so many people who've come into my world as an entrepreneur or as someone who wanted to be an entrepreneur and they're going going to hit a trial and they fail hit a trial and they fail and the ones who are successful realize that there's going to be trials along the way like so many thing after thing after thing after thing right and so I see what happened to him before he ever had any success and just it hit and it was such a I mean 15 years he spent writing this manuscript and he's gone overnight and instead of what most people stop he's just like all right let's just keep going let's just start over from scratch what's fascinating about this this this pattern like followed him throughout the rest of his life right they always say that like you know people that win like winners win right you know how to win you continue to win and so he's just a good example of a winner so after he launches this magazine think about he launches magazine it's hugely successful starts growing around the world yeah again 1897 launches by 1908 this thing is huge there's literally millions of people around the country reading it they moved their offices to downtown new york they're in a 12 story building the building still I haven't seen yet but I'm gonna go next time in New York I'm gonna go find the building this is big building 12 story building and that's where success magazines being published from shipped out they had the publishing the printing everything happening here and they've shipped this magazine out through the entire world and it was having a ton of success again 1908 and then by 1911 he had brought in some investors and things that happened and investors had changed the magazine from being personal development to trying to like make it more businessy and and all these ups and downs and by 1911 the magazine actually failed and by 1912 it was it was gone like completely finished and think about it he spent the last 12 13 years of his life publishing his magazine putting it out there just to have it fail and on top of that even though there wasn't social media back then there were newspapers and there were all sorts of stuff and so people like I don't know there's a time when like people love the the hero story of a hero building up and trying to create something but then people love watching a hero fail like you see it all the time like you know the same people that were cheering you as you were growing or the same ones that you fail or like want to laugh at you so he this magazine failed what happens is all the publishers all the all the writers around the country they all start publishing like literally headlines where success fails and they were so excited to announce the world that success magazine he's gonna be successful it actually failed and I look at that I'm like I imagine like you've been teaching people success principles for 15 years of your life you're so proud of it and it fails and instead of like just having this thing you kind of walk away from and don't want anyone to notice like everybody's watching this failure across the country it's in every magazine it's on the radio it's like and everyone's so excited to talk about the fact that his magazine failed right now again most people they done that spot like you would have like you would have walked away you would have hit you would have like changed the industry you would have done anything but instead like he's there he's like I still believe in these principles like yes we failed but doesn't mean we're failures which is where most people end up failing right it's like they say I'm a failure he said this failed but I'm not a failure and so for the next few years Orson went back and he kept a couple people from the staff and the from the magazine printing company and he started writing books and if you look at the number of books he's written probably I don't know exactly 30 to 40 other personal development books that are amazing some of my favorite books Orson wrote during this window of time while he was trying to figure out how do I get the magazine back so he's trying different things he's trying to figure stuff out and fast forward to so between 1912 and 1917 nothing was published for five years he's trying to figure this out and then in 1918 during World War I he finds an investor who's willing to invest some money to bring Success Magazine back so he gets this investor he go back and he buys the magazine out of bankruptcy and he relaunches it five years later right and then what's crazy is over the next time basically from 1918 to 1924 so for the next six years of his life he starts publishing his magazine brings it back and in the next six years he gets the subscriptions his magazine more people are subscribed to the magazine when he died in 1924 than at the peak prior I look at that it's just like one of those like comeback stories that you're just like this guy who lost everything in the public eye and everyone's talking about him instead of like doing what most of us are doing hide and shut down he came back and like all right I'm gonna mount a battle plan how am I gonna win I'm gonna figure out how to win because I'm a winner and winners win right came back mounted this battle plan comes back and over the next six years builds it bigger than when he had it originally that's the story of Orson Swetmar like one of my favorite characters in history but specifically history of like the personal development world right during his life he published over 200 magazines before he passed away and such a testament of like resilience in entrepreneurs those who really believe in their mission and what they're doing to keep coming out there I think for me specifically I've had ups and downs in my business I've had the hero story where I'm rising everyone's cheering for me like yeah this just like feels really good and you get to the top and then in your top then everyone wants to tear you down I felt that part of it as well right I felt remounting the new comeback story so for me it just gives me like a blueprint of a human who's gone through that in the public eye and successfully done it throughout his life and gives me excitement and motivation as I'm working back through my comeback stories as well I think for me the one of the main reasons why like I fall in love with Orson Swetmar in his story is because it's literally the story I've been going through a decade ago is when we launched the company ClickFunnels and we were the underdogs we were fighting against all the companies that all this VC funding and had money and we were like the scrappy young guys who were bootstrapping we came out and out the gate we started having success and started growing right and it was awesome like everyone was cheering for us like we were the heroes like it was it was crazy everyone was talking about us we got PR we were on tv like every podcast was like fighting to have me on like it was this huge thing and again people love the hero's journey right and they loved cheering you on during that part and for me it felt it felt amazing like you know like this is the greatest ride of my life right and I look at ClickFunnels in our story like the first seven years that's where we're at like everything was going perfectly and it was really fun right same thing with Success Magazine he goes downtown New York he had this huge 12 12 story building right and everyone's cheering for him he's successful and I felt like that was the same spot I was in for the first seven years of ClickFunnels it's funny because like at that point for us like we wanted to make a change and it was not this is the hardest thing it wasn't for me personally we had an offer from the buyer company I would have been like insanely rich for the rest of my life and we decided to turn the money down because we wanted to create something different and better for our audience like that's the part I think was so hard for me so we spent the next three years two or three years of our lives like tens of millions of dollars every penny we'd earn dumping back into rebuilding the ClickFunnels platform to give this as a gift to our to our community to our to everyone right two years later we come out and we launch it it's different like launching software the very first time when you have zero customers and you get 10 and 20 and you're fixing bugs long way is one thing the second time we launched this we had 18,000 people sign up the very first week and so the software was working for us we've been using it for a year before we let anybody else use it but we added 18,000 people overnight and it was like it it's stress tested everything right and things started falling apart and it was crazy because during this time when we'd create this gift that we were trying to give our audience and we told them this is better beta you still get access to the to the original ClickFunnels this is other thing like we were so excited but what happened is like there was this gap and it was like all of a sudden everyone was so excited to like oh the new ClickFunnels sucks like all these different things coming out we a lot of competitors who are literally paying people like I've seen the contracts they're literally paying people like say these things about ClickFunnels and they're paying off all these people who had been affiliates of ours had been partners with us in the past literally writing them checks like like we'll pay you ten thousand dollars a month contractually and you have to do like it's it's insane when you see the actual contracts but that's what was happening right so we have all these people attacking us and I felt probably a little bit what Orson felt where you open up any magazine any radio station and the headlines our success failed and everyone's so excited they want to see the hero crash and for the next three or four years that's what I dealt with and it was hard and it was brutal and during that time I mean there are a lot of personal battles you know we have families drama we had you know my business partner best friend passed away it was just like this the series of getting beaten beaten down and it was like the time when like all the people who were cheering my name I was like I was like where are these people all go like now they're on the other side and I think for me it was I don't know just I mean a dark a dark period in dark time man probably a little less than a year ago because it's probably just like I just want to tap out like I was creating this for the same people who are now attacking me and it was just like I don't know how to deal with this and the rest of the time where I just wanted to walk away and just like this is not worth it like I'm fine I don't need to do this I'm not doing this for myself I was doing it to serve you and you're the same people now who are who are doing this and so about a year ago is when I decided it's like no like I believe in this I believe in the mission I believe in what we're actually doing so we've been remounting our comeback story and there's a lot of stuff happening behind the scenes I'm sure our community has seen it Funnel Hacking Live this year we did our last big Funnel Hacking Live and I did a presentation at the end walking through the last 10 years of ClickFunnels and talking about the trajectory and since we've done a rebranding you can see the new logo on our our shirts but we did a rebrand kind of like refresh everything it's interesting because Orson also rebranded like there's times when this is called the success and then when he came back it was called the new success and that tagline ran for four or five years before it switched back to success but it was like rebranding coming back out a lot of the campaigns initiatives that we are doing right now are insane and we're getting market share back like things are growing things are happening and it's cool so I feel like I'm in the middle of this right like 1918 is when Orson took this back over and started republishing I feel like I'm in 1918 maybe 1919 right now where it's like we're coming back and we're swinging and we're getting market share back and it's fun and it's exciting and again maybe it's gonna take me five or six years like to Orson but there will be a time in the near future where what we will accomplish with ClickFunnels will be bigger than we ever had before and so for me it's it's a blueprint it's a blueprint entrepreneur who went through this just like me in a different time period different era but the same struggles the same hero's journey and now I have a chance to kind of live my version of it so it's always nice when you've had somebody go ahead of you just to give you inspiration and and a belief that you can do what you're trying to do for me I'm a big fan of modeling and if I can't find someone to model in a situation or circumstance it's hard to to persevere sometimes through the pain we can find someone you're like okay that person did it I can do it and so that's why the Orson Sweat Martin story is so important to me I hope this helps you as you're going through things right my guess is you listen right now you're probably a couple of them phases maybe you are at the beginning of your hero's journey you're trying to get the initial or inertia and momentum to like to get out there and you're living out your hero's journey right now right you heard the call to adventure and you're going on this journey and so I hope this gives you inspiration for the first part of the excitement of like creating something new like launching the very first version of your magazine or your funnel your course whatever the thing is for you right and the number two for those guys who have gone that journey right and you're at the top and now you got people who want to see you as a hero fall I hope it gives you some inspiration and motivation and just like the belief that's like what you're doing is worth it and you can succeed you might have to do what Orson did takes takes it back for a couple years like regroup figure things out and then come back again and that's okay like that's what I've had to do I took time to like figure out like what I wanted to do where I wanted to go what I need to become like how we have to change things differently to be able to be successful and so I hope you got the value from this video I went through this magazine and there's again so many really cool articles I pulled out some of my favorite notes including this this this article with Lincoln again Lincoln was on the cover here there's a lot of cool stories about Lincoln like literally it's telling that like the step by step how he got to the White House and what he did how he did it and so in my notes I'll have already published the full article of the Lincoln one because that one's so cool and against the cover shot here and then some of my notes from some of the other articles you guys can read I'll go down in the description we'll put a link to there for free you can go get the notes to the first ever issue of success magazine with that said I hope you guys enjoyed this video I cannot wait to see you on the next one
