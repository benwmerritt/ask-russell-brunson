## Transcript
So I had an idea. How many of you would like to spend 30 days with me one-on-one where we can actually get a whole bunch of stuff done and hopefully change your life? This idea actually came to me on a cruise with my family for spring break. I brought these two books with me. The first one is Living with the Silly with Jesse Isler. And what's cool about it is Jesse was at an Iron Man and he saw David Goggins. And he was like, I'd never seen anything like this in my life. And I was like, I got to meet this guy and see what makes him tick. Jesse asked him if he could hire him for a month to live with him. And Goggins was like, sure. I thought he was crazy. And so this book is documenting living with a seal for 30 days, day by day by day. And it is like the coolest, craziest, insane book. A couple years later, he launched The Next Book, which is Living with the Monk, which was amazing as well, because now he's living in a monastery with these monks. You know, cell phone, none of the distractions of life. And I was looking at these different experiences and like, man, I want to do more of that. I would love to do something like that. And then I thought, I wonder if any of you guys would be interested in doing that with me. If someone came to me and said, Russell, we spent 30 days with me. I was like, what would that look like? And I sat down and I actually started making a plan. And when I got done, I was like, this plan is actually pretty fun. I'm going to walk you through what the 30 day plan is day by day right now. And at the end of this video, I'll actually give you a link where you can download the entire 30 day plan. And then I want some of you guys to actually live it for 30 days and let me know what happens. All right, here we go. So day number one, I forgot what is your reason for being like, why are you here? What are you doing? Like, what am I trying to pursue? But more importantly, I think is who like, who do you actually want to become in this 30 days, but also throughout your entire life? Like the more we can identify that, like who are you trying to become? It makes setting these goals and the destination so much easier. Now, if you figure out who you want to become, then it's kind of reverse engineering. Okay, to become that person long term, like what do I need to accomplish next 30 days? And why you actually set a real tangible goal, not like I'm going to work out more often. It's like I got to do 1000 pull ups in 30 days. Or it's like I'm going to launch my funnel or I'm going to be launching my business. I need to make a million dollars or 200 dollars, whatever it is for you. Like setting an actual goal and then commit to it. So day number two now, the goal with day number two is figure out like, who is your guide and what is the plan you are going to be executing on? Now, if you're coming to me and it's business related, I'm probably going to be your guide. But if not, let's say it's athletics. Maybe you're a runner. If your guide is not going to be me. So who is the guide? The goal that you're trying to accomplish that you set yesterday? Who's already done that? That's going to become your guide. You're going to listen to that person every single day. You're going to read their books, listen to their podcasts, whatever it is. You can get into the same mindset that they're in. And if from there, figure out what is the plan? Every single person who's been successful actually had a step by step plan. It's like a map, right? A lot of times those maps are found in books. Sometimes they're found in podcasts. Like, wait, figure out what is the map of the steps I need to do over the next 30 days to actually achieve the goal? And the last step for today is based on that we need to figure out what are the routines and the habits you have to create to be able to make this a reality. But with David Goggins and with Jesse, it was very simple. Every morning they woke up and they ran and they went to the gym and they had two or three workouts through that day. But it was very much the first thing he instilled is a routine to help them to get to the finish line. So day number three, I want to create a little pressure. Okay. A lot of times people set a goal and they never tell me about it. And so because that nothing ever happens. And so for you, what I want you to do is I want you to actually start documenting the process. And ideally I want you to document it socially. In fact, for me, recently I'm working on a new project. I'm trying to sell a million copies of my book. And so what I started doing is documenting the process. Every single day I go live on Instagram and I share here's what I did today to hit that goal. And I don't care where you document it. It could be a YouTube video. It could be Instagram. I'm just going to figure out some platform where you can start documenting this process because as you start documenting the process and showing what you're doing, it makes you more intentional about what you're actually doing every single day. All right. Day number four, now you got to get to actually work, right? So as you start working and start pursuing, start moving towards the goal, what always happens is you immediately will hit resistance. Now, what is resistance? Resistance is that thing that keeps you from actually achieving the life that you want to live. And it's hitting you all the time. One of my favorite authors, Stephen Pressfield wrote a book called The War of Art where he talks about resistance. He says that every good writer knows that the hard thing is not actually writing the book. It's sitting down to write. The hard part is not working out to get to the gym. It's like actually getting to the gym. That's the hardest part. What I want you to do is I want you to be aware of that. And so I want you for an entire day today, it's actually time track. Every time resistance hits you to write down what it was, the time of day, and then if you're able to overcome it. 6am, resistance hit me. It didn't want me to get a bed, but I did. 10am, Instagram popped up, grabbed my phone and resistance was pushing me. They're like, whatever it is, they start time tracking because when you start becoming aware of it and you start giving it a name, you're able to stop because you're like, oh, that was resistance again. Get back to focus. All right. Day number five now, nothing great has ever been accomplished alone. This is when we start gathering our mastermind of people for you to execute on your vision. Who else do you need to be part of it? I couldn't have built ClickFunnels by myself. I'm not a programmer. I don't know how to do customer support. I don't know how to do like most of the things, right? So for me to build ClickFunnels, I just start gathering my mastermind group of people. For you, it's the same thing. If you want your goal, like who are the people you need around you to be successful? A lot of times people tell me, well, I'm an athlete. Like it doesn't matter to me, but I think about myself when I was an athlete, I was a wrestler, a wrestler in a one-on-one sport, but I needed coaches. I needed my family. So who are the people you need to be successful? These might be employees, might be team members, might be partners. Because I guarantee you in the next three days, if you don't have these people around you, it's not going to be possible to achieve greatness. All right, day number six. It's probably Saturday right now. This is your progress check. We have a chance to actually look at what happened, what's working, what's not working. Now, what most people do, most people are so scared to look at failure in the eye that they just kind of ignore it. So I want to stop. I want you to stop and look at everything that's happened the last five days. Like, is it working? Is it not working? Where did I fail? Was the goal right? Was my team right? The people I'm putting together? Like, what's wrong? Okay, one of the most powerful lessons I learned from wrestling is I go to a match and I would go out there and wrestle and I would lose. But because I lost it, I mean, I was a loser. It just meant that I lost and I had something to learn now. Within three or four weeks, I was then able to beat those people because I looked at the mistakes I made and I fixed it. So this is the time to really hold yourself accountable. Like, is this working? Be honest to yourself, make those adjustments and then get back to work. Day number seven is your day of rest. I'm a big believer in this. If God can build the heavens and the earth in six days and have a day of rest, you can take a day of rest from your job as well. To help refresh yourself, rejuvenate yourself, you can also give your subconscious mind the ability and the time to go and find the answers to the problems you're trying to solve. Think about how many times are you guys in the shower and all of a sudden, the good idea pops up. It's because your conscious mind is no longer focusing on the problem. It looks away for a little bit. Your subconscious mind can find it and delivers it up to you. And so don't discount the power of your subconscious mind. Relax, spend time with your family and go have some fun. Alright, welcome to week number two. This week, we'll be focusing on energy management. One of the reasons why people aren't successful is because they don't have enough energy to actually get things done. This week, I want to make sure that you have the ability to focus both mentally and physically to execute on those goals. The first thing you can actually do is actually go get a blood test. A lot of times, we've been eating so many things that all sorts of stuff is happening in our blood that we don't even know about. I'm a big believer in not guessing. If you're not testing, you're just guessing. The place I use, if you go to unfairadvantage.com, you get your blood test there. And after you get your blood test, they actually will build out custom supplement packs for you. It'll help realign everything in your blood back to optimal level for performance. So I'd go get the blood test today. That way, by next week, we'll have the correct supplements you're going to need. Alright, number two, I'm going to shift how you're actually eating right now. Now, most people, especially here in America, they eat incorrectly. You wake up in the morning, you have some toast, you have some bacon, some eggs, and immediately out the door, you are tired. The number one thing that takes energy from your body is actually digestion. You have a whole bunch of food in your body, your body's got to digest it, and it makes you tired. In fact, Jesse talked about this in both books, fascinating. He's had nothing but fruit before lunch because fruit digest so much faster and keeps your energy high. Now, I'm not someone who eats fruit before lunch, but that's how Jesse does it. But I am a big believer in not eating in the morning. I'm drinking a whole bunch of water and taking a bunch of supplements. I want that stuff to absorb into my body, into my blood as quick as possible, and I wait to eat as long as possible. So, I'm going to skip breakfast. I promise you'll keep your energy and your focus and your mental clarity so much better during the prime working hours, which is usually from like six in the morning until noon. My lunch is going to be a very high protein lunch. Meats, shrimp, chicken steak, or if you want to have my protein pancakes, you can find a video on my Instagram channel showing how I make my protein pancakes. And number three is the dinner time is where I have as much diversity as possible. Meats, vegetables, fruits, fats, like all those kind of things are great to have. Carbs, I'm okay having all kinds of stuff I have at night because that way I fall asleep easier at night. So, I have big dinners with all the different things. All right, day number nine now, we're going to start focusing on kind of tying these things into your morning routine. Okay, so in the morning, we're going to wake up and we're going to hyper hydrate drink as much water as you can possibly take all your supplements. I'm also a big believer in fasted morning workouts. I'm drinking, but no food while I'm working out. It's actually a much better way to work out. So, I do fasted morning workout and then from that workout until about noon before I start eating, this is where I'm going to do my brain work. I try to spend most of the time writing, thinking, and just having time with my brain before I get any of the food and carbs in my body to make sure you get the most important and vital things done first. All right, day number ten is we're going to start looking at the progress on your goal. Are you one third of the way to the goal you were trying to hit? If not, it's time to be honest and look at like what are the things that are holding me back? Typically what happens is we start pursuing towards the goal. If we get stuck on something, we start procrastinating. The procrastination always happens when we're trying to figure out what to do. That throws us into this procrastination where we're studying or learning or reading books trying to figure out how to do it. To be successful, I learned from Dan Sullivan. Instead of searching for what do I need to do, you stop and say, who already knows what to do? Who can I find who can solve this problem for me? Start shifting that and start focusing on the who's so we can get to the goal before the 30 days is over. Day number 11. Now, here's where we're going to set what we call our lead or goal deadlines. I learned this originally from Lake Gary Howard, who's one of the greatest copywriters who's ever graced this planet. And he told a story about, and again, I don't know how true the story is. He said that when the mafia wants to get a law passed, they come up to the person who can make the change. He says, you got two options, either lead or gold. The bribe or the bolt, these are your two options. And when those are your two options, it's really easy to take the bribe, to take the gold, right? And in my mind, I have to trick my mind that if I don't hit this deadline, then I'm literally going to die. If I do hit it, I get a bag of gold. And that may mean that I had to pull out a lighter one night. It may mean that I have to come in early a couple of times, but I make sure I'm not going to miss that deadline. Because if I do, it's a letter goal. Day number 12, when we continue to work towards our goal, one thing I want to introduce this time also is what's called a time tracker. Now, time trackers are powerful because a lot of times we think we're super efficient and getting things done. But when you actually look from the outside in, you're like, man, you spent a lot of time today on Instagram or doing this or talking to the water cooler, blah, blah, blah, whatever it might be. Track it out and every about 10, 15 minutes you track exactly what you're doing. Hey, I'm working on my book. Hey, this is what's happening. Hey, I'm doing this. And you start realizing that, man, I spent four hours today not moving towards my goal. 5.30, judge a size. 6.30, dinner with me. I can't cancel that again. 7 o'clock, wrestle with myself loading. I'm booked. The reality is, I think most people in eight hour a day probably work about one hour during that day. So I want to make sure that we do a time tracker, see where the gaps are, to make sure you are spending all of your time pursuing your goals and not wasting it on stuff that's not important. Day number 13 is what I'm calling a day of variety. One of the problems we have when we set habits and routines, we're doing the same thing every single time, is eventually your brain starts actually deleting the things from your mind. It's like, oh, every single day we woke up and we did the same thing, starts forgetting what you actually did and your life actually starts feeling shorter. It's really sad. And so what I wanted to introduce on this day is what's called a day of variety or an event horizon, where you're something completely different from the normal. It makes your life actually feel longer, more fulfilled, more happy. Go out there and have some fun. Whatever it is for you. It's going up by kids and going swimming. Maybe it's going to the wrestling room. For you, you might be going hiking. I'm not a hiker, so that sounds horrible to me, but for you, maybe go hiking, whatever you want to do. And day number 14, once again, is the day of rest. Spend some time with your family, spend some time with God, whatever it is for you. But don't work today. Once again, let yourself come to mind, find the solutions to the problems you've been struggling with. Now, at this point, we're officially on week number three, which I call the sprint. Okay, we are two weeks into this right now. We've been putting on the habits, the routines, all sorts of stuff, but now it's like we're halfway to our goal. I got to get stuff done. This is where it starts sprinting and start really executing very, very quickly to make sure we don't miss our deadline at the end of this month. So day number 15, I'm going to start blocking your day into 60 minute blocks, okay? Which basically means you have 15 minutes of actually working hard and then 10 minute break. I'll typically do four or five of those during the day. What you'll see is during those sections where your time is blocked out, you'll get more done in one or two of those blocks than most people get done an entire week. Now, to do that, all distractions are gone. Facebook, Instagram, cell phones, everything's gone. It's just focusing on the thing you are trying to get done. Now, if you're like me and you have ADD for me to be able to do this, I literally have my stand-up desk. I raise it up. I have a treadmill. I'm walking on my treadmill. I'm doing this because it focuses me and makes sure that there's no other distractions I can possibly get in my way. One of the powerful things, hopefully by day 15, your supplements will have showed up. The way these work is you take a pack in the morning, you take a pack at night, and you take a pack during the middle of the day. By optimizing your blood, you're going to feel better. You have more energy. You can be less tired. Your food will digest better. Like by the end of this week, you'll already start feeling better. By the end of next week, you're going to feel like a million bucks. All right. Day number 16 through day number 19 is just continuing on the sprint. It's going through these one-hour blocks, 15 minutes on, 10 minutes off. And then the other thing is that you get closer and closer to the finish line. You start realizing that there's like the half to halves and the nice to halves. You know, initially, I wanted to create all these things, but if I do all these things, it's going to take me another six months or so. And so what happens for me is I start moving through the sprint. I start saying, ah, that'd be really cool to have, but I'm going to have to do that in version number two. I'll cut this part out. I'll start cutting things and start focusing on just the essentials. And you start doing that. The load will get lighter and lighter as you're increasing your speed and increasing your production. You get closer and closer to the finish line. All right. Day 20 and 21. This is Saturday and Sunday. Once again, this is going to be your day of variety on Saturday and then a day of rest on Sunday. Disconnect. Even if you're stressing out, it's okay. Disconnect. Like you should have conscious mind, get some work done. So on Monday, when you show up, the answers will be there ready for you, but make sure you unplug on Saturday and Sunday and have to phone your family. Now I want to officially welcome you week number four. We're almost there. We're two thirds of the way. Whoa. We're three fourths of the way there. Math. This week is called letter gold. The reason why is because you are literally at your last letter gold deadline. At the end of this week, we've got two options and I'm hoping that we'll have a chance to give you the gold. And so with that said, day number 22 is all about focusing on the straight line. You get so about looking at, okay, what are those exact things I have to get done to execute my goal by this weekend. And then just doing those and nothing else. No more wasting time on the nice to haves or anything else. It's all about just the straight line of everything I do to be successful today and cutting out everything else. All right. Day number 23. This is where as you're moving towards your goal, if you have a team of people, everyone's been working on different silos, different parts of the project. Now it's bringing all those pieces back together, kind of assembling the final product, whatever you are creating. And so this is really time you're assembling your dream 100s, making sure that they didn't miss in their deadlines, making sure that all the pieces are coming together for the finished product that you are creating. All right. Day number 24. Now it's all about now you've assembled everybody's stuff together. You're starting to test those things, find the failure points that's working. It's not working in business. This is where I'm going through the funnel. And I'm literally taking my credit card. I'm buying every single step to make sure it's working. I'm testing the emails. I'm testing the stuff. I'm seeing if it makes sense. I'm having other people look at the project and like, does it make sense to you? Because sometimes we're so deep in the project and it's up to our face like this, that it makes sense to us, but someone else sees it like, what are you talking about? This makes no logical sense. So I'm having other people run through it, but I'm testing things, where those gaps, where those holes are so I can isolate those clean those things up. So I'll be ready for the end day. Day number 25. Now this is launch day. This is the letter goal day. This is where we have a chance. Put it out into the marketplace, put it out into the world and see what happens. If you're an athlete today, the competition day. This is where we complete let go of the outcomes and we just leave it to God. When I watch people who are successful competing, especially in athletics, I see it in business as well. Those who are so scared of the outcome and what if the outcome has happened? What if it, what if it, what if it doesn't happen? Like that thing is what keeps them from actually being successful. So this point we have to forget about the outcome. It doesn't matter. It's out of your hands. You've done all the best you possibly could. And now we step on the mat and we have the wrestling match. We step in the field and we have the game. We put the product out in the marketplace and see what the customers think about it. And this point, again, forget all the outcomes and leave it to God and hope for the best. Day number 26. Now we start looking at the results. What worked, what didn't work? What are the things we can shift and things we can tweak? A lot of people think the launch day is the last day. You have to understand the launch day is the first day. Most people think that if they didn't have success on day number 25, that means that they're a failure. It doesn't mean that you're a failure. It just means you failed, right? And that's fine. I'm totally cool with failing. Failure gives you more data points than anything else possible, right? So we look at the failures, fix those things and then roll it out again. Day number 27. This is the day about reflection. There's a really good book that all entrepreneurs should read. It's called The Gap and the Game by Dan Sullivan and Ben Hardy. And in this book, he talks about the ideal, the thing we're trying to achieve is kind of like a horizon line. And the more you move towards the horizon line, the more the horizon line moves, right? You can't get to the horizon line. It's physically impossible. The same thing with our goals, our dreams. As we move forward, the goals keep shifting. A lot of times for us, it causes depression or anxiety or fear because like, man, I'm never getting to the end. I'm never getting to the ideal, to the horizon line. And so we teach as entrepreneurs in The Gap and the Game is saying, look, if I stop, if I look backwards, if I track my success, not by how far I am from the ideal, but instead how far I've come, that's the secret to happiness. So this day is all about stopping, looking back and like, look what I did. Maybe I didn't get my goal yet. Maybe not where I want to be yet, but man, the last three days, like, look what I accomplished. That brings us to day number 28, which is your next day of rest. Once again, spend time with your family, spend time with God. Enjoy it because shortly thereafter, we're moving on to the next sprint, which is our day number 29 and day number 30, which is all about figuring out from here, what's the next goal? Where am I going next? We figure out the new plan and this is all about kind of preparing and putting things together so that the next 30 days, we get the next milestone. All right, so there's my 30 day plan. That's kind of what it looked like if I was to live with you for the next 30 days. I think we have a lot of fun. So if you're interested, first off, let me know in the comments down below. Maybe we'll pull a random subscriber and have you come out to my house. That might be kind of weird. I don't think my wife would like that. Anyway, down in the description, I'm going to go put the entire blueprint for the 30 days down there. You can download it and you can have it as a guide. And then I want to encourage some of you guys to do this process. I'd be curious to see whatever goal does you have. Again, it could be a goal in sports. It could be in business. Like, set a goal, go through the 30 day plan. Let me know how it goes. I'd be curious to know what it would do. And then on top of that, if you were to do a 30 day plan for somebody else, what would it look like if someone was going to stay with you? Let me know in the comments down below. Thanks so much, guys, for helping enjoy this video. And I cannot wait to spend the next 30 days with you, helping you to accomplish this goal.
