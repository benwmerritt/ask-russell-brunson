So what is Funnel Flicks? This is a new feature we've added to ClickFunnels to help change your business, and I hope it'll change your life as well. So let me explain exactly what it is. In the past, we found that the people who have the most success in ClickFunnels, they're not the people who just sign up for an account and start using it. It's people who sign up for the account, but they understand the strategy behind funnel building. They understand what does a funnel look like, what does a funnel look like for my specific business? What are the videos and the copy I need to put on the pages? Like how do I actually drive traffic? And then how do I get out of my own head? Some people get stuck with the mind games that happen as an entrepreneur. And so what I found is people who have the most success are the ones who are going and looking for more answers. They were going to coaching programs, they're buying courses and all sorts of things. And those are the people who have the most success. And I thought, man, there's so many of our members who would have success, they don't have access to all these other resources. And so a little while ago, we sat down and said, what if we could brainstorm a way to get access to all these amazing training and programs and courses and give them to our ClickFunnels members for free? And at first it seemed like it was gonna be possible. In fact, some of the people you'll see, their courses down below, people like Tony Robbins and Jay Abraham and other people, I was like, I wanna license these courses from you. And those things obviously aren't cheap when it's the products and services they sell every single day on their own websites. And so we sat back and we figured out a way to do it. And if you look down below, you'll see the courses you'll get immediate access to as soon as you become a ClickFunnels Platinum member. So what is a ClickFunnels Platinum member? Whereas you know there's two different tiers inside of ClickFunnels right now. You can pay, we have people pay $97 a month, they get access to ClickFunnels, and we have a tier at $297, which gives you access to a whole bunch more things. You get unlimited funnels in your account, you get user accounts, you get a whole bunch of amazing things on the ClickFunnels side. And we thought, how about this, anybody who's a ClickFunnels Platinum member who's upgraded their account, what if we give them access to almost all of these trainings down below for free? And at first it didn't make sense, but we figured out the way the numbers to make it work. And so because of that, we've been able to create this amazing upgrade for you. Now what's interesting is if you look down below, you'll see a whole bunch of different training courses down below, courses that I've sold in the past for, anywhere from $500 to $1,000. You'll see live events I did that people pay $10,000 to be in the room, they're down below. Special trainings that only happen for Inner Circle members to pay $25,000 to $50,000 or more in this member's area as well. So inside of FunnelFlix, you're literally gonna access the things that other people have had to pay tens of thousands of dollars for, you get for free when you're a ClickFunnels Platinum member. There's a whole bunch of other amazing things as well. So I don't have time to go into all of it. All I want you to do now is go click on the videos down below and go watch some of the trailers for the courses. And as you're watching them, think about like, what's the course that you're looking for? What's the missing piece in your business? I promise you that every business question you have is answered inside of FunnelFlix. Okay, if you're stuck like, I can't get motivated, how do I get more motivation so I can actually succeed? Okay, I guarantee you inside of Tony Robbins course, he's gonna teach you exactly how to get the motivation and the mindset you need to be successful. You feel like, I got the mindset, but my funnels are horrible. Go through the funnel building train, there's multiple different trains on funnel building inside of there. Maybe you have a funnel, but it's not converting. Okay, go through the trains teaching you how to sell, how to speak, how to do videos. Those trains help you there. If you have funnels that work, you can't get traffic, go through all the traffic trainings. Okay, there's courses in there that will help you to get your business to the next level, and we're always adding new stuff in there as well. But the only way to get access to all of this stuff, you can't pay for it. In fact, if you gave me money right now, I wouldn't even take it. Most of these courses are not for sell anywhere unless we license them from somebody else. But if you want access to all of them for free, all you gotta do is upgrade to our ClickFunnels Platinum level right now. Not only is there training courses, there's also documentaries, help inspire you, get you excited about your role as an entrepreneur. There's, again, courses on everything you need, every question you have in your business is answered here inside of FunnelFlix. But all you gotta do is take that leap of faith. And one last thing I have to say is, maybe you're looking at this like, we're also, I don't need that course or that course. That's okay, but there's probably someone on your team who does, maybe there's someone on your team who you want to learn how to drive traffic. Let them log into your ClickFunnels account, come into the FunnelFlix, and watch the training on traffic. Maybe you have a copywriter who's trying to learn how to write better copy, send them through the copywriting training, okay? You have access to all these things inside of your ClickFunnels account right now when you go to upgrade now and upgrade your account.
