## Transcript
Hey, my name is Russell Brunson. I'm the author of this brand new book called Traffic Secrets, if you haven't heard of it yet. Recently, someone was asking me, what's the difference between when someone launches a website or a funnel and has tons of success for someone that doesn't? Obviously, it has something to do with traffic, but it's even more than that. Recently, I did a presentation at a live event teaching the difference between a successful funnel and one that's not. What does it look like? How do you plan the traffic strategies to get the people in the funnels and show up on launch day versus those who try and they kind of struggle and they fail? Let me share making you read that secret right now. I'm just going to give it to you. I'm going to show you guys a video clip from that event where I walked through that process, how it works, and what people you know, how they did it behind the scenes. It's also going to give you a behind the scenes pass of what's actually working and how people are getting tons of traffic to their funnels and their websites the second they launch. So with that said, I'm going to keep the video and then when we come back, I'm going to talk about how you can get your free copy of Traffic Secrets. One of my first mentors, Alex Mendoza, I remember he used to say that the difference between like a launch that fails and a successful launch is how much time you put into it. So I remember he would start asking for us to promote his launch six months before launch would happen. Other people would be like, hey, next week I'm going to launch something. I want to be part of it. He would start six months early, but he'd start before that even planning it. So it was like six months when he was asking and it was just like he had more time. For us, it's kind of a similar thing. In fact, it's kind of fun when the book is done. Because we're going through a traditional publisher, there's a window before I'm able to actually launch it. So I have this nice window, which is going to be filled with like all of those things. But you'll remember this from before. Like the first step is literally Dream 100. Like it's like, okay, let's sit down. In fact, Dave and I, it's so funny we were talking this morning before we drove over and he's like, I can't wait for you to submit this book to the publishers. We can sit down and map out the Dream 100. And you're like, but Russell, you're going to have a Dream 100. Like no, like we start over every single time. And so like we literally have a meeting that's like, hey, podcasting, that's it. And we're bringing somebody specifically to be a Dream 100 manager over just the podcasting vertical alone. And we're going to sit down and we're going to look, hey, here's the top 200 podcasts and iTunes, but here's the other ones and the other ones, the other ones are going to have this huge list. And it's like literally going to be like, okay, who's all the people who's the producers, who sells ads, they run ads, how much like what the ads look like, are they long ads, short ads, is it sponsored ads, is it someone, is the person reading the ad, like what do they look like? And like we're going to dream 100 of the crap out of podcasting. And then literally I've got time blocked out. It's like, okay, Russell's got, you know, five days doing interviews with just podcasts. We're going to set up with all those people and like literally I'll do 200 podcast interviews, they'll all be pre scheduled for launch week. Boom, they're going to hit. And that's just one platform, right? And we'll do the same thing on Facebook, on Instagram, on Google, on the blogging networks and like, like we'll be doing that, building it out, getting all the things in place. So when it hits, it's like, it's going to be, it's going to be loud. I was hanging out with Tony Robbins before, oh, we did an event about a month ago down in Vegas with him. And no, excuse me, it was, it was, it was when we launched mastermind.com, we were Dean's office and, and right before we did the big interview, if you guys saw that we had like 80,000 people live watching us across all the platforms. Like it was, it was really cool. But I was talking to Tony right before that. He said when his last book went, his last book went live, he did 260 interviews leading up to the book going live. Before it was actually live. Wow. Most people think it's like, okay, when the book's going to, you know, funnel's live now it's launched. It's like, you missed it. Like digging your well. I talk a lot about this in the book, digging your well before your Thursday, like digging it now, like I'm going to be sending out to my dream 100 on every single platform, like copies of the manuscript. Like here's the manuscript. 90% of traffic is creative. Like it's tons and tons and tons and tons of ads. If most of you guys are businesses at one level and you're at the next level, like my advice for most of you, if you're running active ads right now, if you're like, I'll probably ask, like how many ads right now are you running? And you're going to say 10. I said, okay, you should be launching 10 a day. Like that's how you scale the next level. It's more creative. And so we're creating the creative as the process of doing the thing. We don't launch the funnel. Like, okay, how do we create an ad? Like you missed it. Like documenting all this stuff. So that one second the funnel goes live. We've got a billion ads of creative going out and just like pummeling the market so that everybody has to buy the book. Welcome back. What'd you think? Did you like that? Um, I hope you did. That's just one, um, one idea, one thought, one way to get traffic into your funnels. There's so many different ways that we do it. And so I spent the last year of my life writing this book. There's over 20 traffic secrets here inside of it from all sorts of things. So how to use Facebook, Google, Instagram, YouTube, but also what happens if you don't have those? I got started in my business before there was a Facebook, before there was my space back when it was Friendster. If any of you guys remember that and how do we get traffic into our funnels? Way back then it was different. And this book shows you the strategies and how to do it no matter what's happening online. So you can get traffic into your funnel. So with that said, right now, because this book is brand new, you can get a hardcover copy for free by going to trafficsecrets.com or clicking on link down below and we'll send you one. All you got to do is let me know where to ship it. You got to cover the shipping handling cost, but I already paid for the printing of this book and I want to give you guys a free copy.
