Hey everyone who's just tuning in, my name is Russell Brunson and today we're going to be talking about Facebook funnels. Every day I go through a bunch of questions you guys ask me about building your company and growing your traffic and your sales and your leads and all sorts of fun stuff. And today we're talking about Facebook funnels. So the question is how do sales funnels and Facebook funnels match up? How should I be using Facebook? So that's a good question and the strategy changes often in a lot of different ways. But I'm going to kind of walk you through the basic principles that we focus on here at ClickFunnels as we're growing ours. So for me and for our team everything kind of starts at the offer level right? So we figure out first off like what is the offer we want to make? Okay so the offer is like I'm going to sell this and they're going to get this and they're going to get this. We figure out the offer right? Then we come back and say okay cool that's the offer they're getting. Then how do we sell that? Okay which is usually primarily like the story. What's the story we're going to use to sell it? It's like cool here's the story. Maybe we're going to do that story on a webinar or a video sales letter or a long form sales letter or whatever. But there's some story that we're telling here that's going to sell that offer right? Pretty simple. And then the last thing is like what's the hook we're going to use to grab them okay? And so the hook then for me comes back here that says Facebook or YouTube or whatever platform you're selling on. Now I want to kind of caveat real quick. Every step in this process there's going to be a hook story and offer. There's a hook story offer in Facebook, there's a hook story offer in the sales video, there's a hook story offer in the upselling. Every piece has that but it's an overarching strategy. If you look at it from a high level it's like the macro before the micro. The macro is like the ad is like the hook right? Then the sales message, the funnel is the story and what you're selling is the actual offer. Okay so you come back to like our core framework of hook, story, offer. Okay so this is the macro looking down. Now the micro looking down again is there's hook story offer in each every single element of this. But for this question we're going to get to the bigger one right? So the question is how do sales funnels and Facebook match up? So for me it's like these two things are tying together very very very similar right? Facebook is the group of people. So over here there's all these people. All of our dream customers are over here. Facebook or YouTube or wherever you want to target makes it simple for us to find out who are the exact customers who want our products right? So when I started selling the book dot com secret I was like who are the people that would want this book? I'm like okay it's entrepreneurs who are mission driven, who whatever right? And I figure out exactly who those people are and Facebook gives me the ability to like to find out exactly who those people are so I can target them perfectly right? So I'll put like a target here. Like we can find exactly who we're trying to target almost perfectly on Facebook okay? Now the goal of this Facebook is to set the hook right? So people are on their feet and they're scrolling through their feet as fast as they can. They're doing it in their desks, they're doing it in their bathrooms, they're doing it while they're walking, they're doing it while they're driving. It's horrible but that's what we're doing right? And in your job in Facebook the first step of the funnel is to stop them and grab them and hook them right? So we hook them and get their attention for just long enough to send them over here okay? And so that's kind of the first step. It's like it's the pre-funnel. Everything happening in Facebook is like the pre-funnel right? And from here then the message needs to match okay? So whatever my hook and stuff that's going to be over here on the sales page has to be similar over here. We've done funnels in the past like our hook on the Facebook is amazing. And then they come over here and there's a mismatch and it doesn't convert. No matter how good that is here or here, if there's disconnect it doesn't work right? In fact a lot of times our headline for the ad will be the exact same headline that's over here right? So I want congruency between the first step and the second step and from there for them to take the offer okay? So then the strategy is like well how do I do this? How do I create the hooks and the ads? And it obviously is always changing all the time but one of my favorite things to do is we never know what hook is going to get somebody to listen right? So I'm trying to hook them to have them come listen to a story about why they should buy my offer. And inside the story there might be four, five or six or ten different things inside the story that I'm telling right? And so inside the story there might be a bunch of different hooks and something like what are the hooks that are just going to grab someone? Is it how quick I did it? How much weight I lost? How much money I made? How much time I took? You know one of my success stories of my students all these are little hooks and so I look at Facebook like a big pond. I'm throwing out these different hooks and I feel which ones are going to work which ones won't work. One of my favorite examples of this was Anthony DiClamendi. He owns a company called Biohacking Secrets and he had a book he created. It was a free book to teach people how to biohack. And at first we said the funnel worked awesome but then we couldn't get people to come over and we couldn't figure out what hook would actually get the right people to come. How do we get his dream customers? So we told Anthony go to a Facebook live every single day and each day try a different hook. So one day he did a Facebook live that was like hey I'm going to show you guys my number one way to biohack my mitochondria or something weird like that right? And he does a Facebook live about that. Puts it out there and guess what? It was a horrible hook. Nobody bought on it. Nobody came and watched it. So the next day he tried a different hook and he tried a different hook and he kept doing different hooks. All of them leading back to the same free book offer he created and he kept trying to think after thing and that's like day 11 or day 12 he made a video. It was called How to Biohack Your Vegetables. It was basically like cooking your vegetables in Keri Gold Butter or something really simple but for some reason that hook it grabbed his dream customers. And that video I'm getting viewed over a million times. He drove tons of people into his funnels and made a bunch of money. Okay? So if you look at this in the macro it's hook story offer and Facebook or the ad platform we're showing a whole bunch of different hooks trying to find out which ones people grab onto. Now if we get them and pull them back here, tell them the story and then we make them the offer. And that's basically how Facebook and how our funnels, how they kind of coexist and how they work together. It's Facebook's where we're placing a whole bunch of hooks and over here is where we're actually telling the story and then make them the offer. So I hope that helps you guys understand how those two things Facebook, funnels and sales funnels, how they work together.
