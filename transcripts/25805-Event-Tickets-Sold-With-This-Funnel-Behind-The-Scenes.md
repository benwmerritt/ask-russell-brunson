## Transcript
Hey, this is Russell Brunson and during this video, I'm going to show you guys behind the scenes of our event funnel that has we've been using for the last 10 years to fill funnel hacking live. I'm going to show you behind the scenes because a lot of you guys are doing either live events or virtual events. And one of the number one questions I get from you guys is how in the world do you use funnels to fill live events? Again, this works for virtual or live events, but specifically, this is the exact funnels and the ads that we've used to fill funnel hacking live year after year after year. So if you want to learn how to fill funnel, this video is going to be great for you. At the end of this video, I'm going to give you all of the pages, the links, everything you need to build the model list and build it outside of your click-fiddle account. And what's cool about this, this is a very simple funnel that anybody can do, even you. So with that said, let's jump right in. The very first thing you need to know is to run an event for a decade, year in and year out, it's always like, how do you reinvent yourself? How do you be exciting? How do you get people to come back to it? It all starts with the ads that people are going to start seeing. And so you'll notice here above, there's a lot of different types of ads we use. Anytime you can get somebody to experience the product, they're more likely to buy it, and so with the ads, I want to try to put people inside of the room and feel how it feels like to be there. So this first ad you can see over here, I'll kind of blow it up. I'm not going to show the audio, just the visuals you can see from this. As you'll notice, it's like we're trying to get people like a feeling of like this, what it feels like when you're in funnel hacking live and you see the energy and the emotion and like what you'll notice is like the shots we're trying to get are either, as you can see, it's like the audience, like we're running in with the audience. You're trying to get people's eyes, you're trying to get like the feeling of them being inside of it, right? Our camera guys are during the event on stage, running with people, getting their awards, all kinds of stuff like they want to experience what looks like behind the scenes, in front of the scenes. And so we're using a lot of visuals because I want people to put themselves in the mind instead of like, wow, this is actually happening. Like this is what it'd be like to be in that room, right? So that's what this type of ad is like a feeling at. I don't want them to feel what it feels like to be part of funnel hacking live. Next, we always try to do fun pattern interrupts. And so for those who've been there in the past, they see this to remember some of the funny things and it makes them want to come back. Those who have it, it's like, Oh, this is different than other events. This is like really fun. So I'll show you just a few seconds of the video. Funnel hacking live is an event like no other. Where thousands of people gather together to be inspired by world class marketers like Russell Brunson, Tony Robbins, Katelyn Pruin, and many more. However, it's also four days of intense training that's going to take everything you've got to come out the other side. That's why we created funnel hacking live survival drive. Four days is a long time. Is it worth it? Okay. Now I wish you the whole thing, but obviously, you don't want to watch a full 30 minute ad, but you know, bring humor in to make it just different and unique. Right. Um, whenever we're building a long-term campaign like this, like to fill a funnel hacking live, it takes us about 10 months to fill it. So like we're hitting different angles. So there's the experiential, there's the comedy. So the question I was asking like, like, how do I give people a reason to buy now? Right. And so that's what this ad was for. So they really play into that part of the season. Check that check out part of this ad. What are you doing? I'm trying to hide my money from the IRS so I can pay less in taxes. Oh, there's a better way, honey. Didn't you hear the last funnel hacking live is in Vegas. And when you click the link below to buy a ticket before December 31st, you can write off your entire expense from your taxes. But could I write off my flights to Vegas? That's what I said. Well, how about the hotel? You can write off everything and the ticket to funnel hacking live. Are you even listening to what I'm saying or bent my life savings on blackjack going shopping and mirroring a girl named Sparkles? Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't go crazy with. Okay. So there you go. So that's kind of a, uh, just a visual of like, uh, an ad again, or try to feel like what's the reason for them to buy now? So there's these things do around New Year's, those things we do around Valentine's, like whatever the holiday, whatever the thing is, like we're looking for different reasons to get people to promote. Okay. So that's the first thing when you're putting together your campaign for live and just realizing you gotta hit it from a lot of different angles, a lot of different ads, a lot of creative, different things to be mixing up to be able to get the right message and get people to want to come. Now, obviously, if you can sell stuff online, you're going to need a good funnel. But if you want a great funnel, then you're going to need to use ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels is the number one funnel builder in the world. And it's helped more first time entrepreneurs to leave their nine to five job and to launch their dreams than any other company in the world. ClickFunnels was built for dreamers and for doers. And you can get your free fourth day trial by clicking on the link in the description down below or by going to clickfunnels.com slash YouTube right now. ClickFunnels, because you're one funnel away from changing the world. Okay. So now you guys see some of the hooks we use to get people in. Now I'm going to walk you through the actual funnel. Now what's cool about event funnels is that they're not that complicated. They're very simple, but the reality is, is even though I'm going to show you as the core event funnel we use to sell funnel hacking live, there's two other funnels that we're also using kind of behind the scenes to sell tickets. And so I'm going to show you guys all those different funnels. And so you have a chance to see them all. Okay. So this is inside of the new ClickFunnels. You can kind of see what it looks like. Um, you know, page number one, it's a very simple funnel page number one. They go and they see the video about the event page number two, then we have an ups, oh, and there's a word of form obviously where they go and they buy page number two, then we have an upsell to get them to buy VIP ticket and then separate the really thank them. So that's it. Three page funnel, very simple, very easy. I'll walk you through each of the pages and some of the intricacies and the important things about each of the pages. Okay. So here's the very first page and, um, you know, first page, a couple of things is to get typically because this is an event, um, events of all the things we sell are the hardest things to sell, right? Cause it's not just like, uh, do I want to come to the event? Right? It's like, okay, I have to get time off work. I got to convince my spouse. I got to get flights. I get hotels. Like it's one of the hardest things to sell, uh, in our entire business. Like events and continuity are the two hardest things. And so a couple of things above the fold. Number one is I want to have a spot. They can quickly, easily get tickets above the full. That's why there's like, get the tickets button way up here. I'm not trying to hide this, not like a VSL product. I'm trying to sell something, you know, like watch the video for 30 minutes. I'm going to pop up in order form with this. It's like, I want them coming because they're going to see this page hundreds of times before they commit to it. Right. It's not like a impulse buy. It's much more of a, I got to consistently get them excited by it. Right. Again, that's why for funnel hack life is a 10 month cycle to get the event filled. Okay. Number two is the headline, obviously, which is key. And what you want to have in the headline above the fold, really big art of the location and the dates and times. Number one question we get is when is it happening? What's the dates with, you know, and they, if they don't see that in front of their face all the time, then there's a good shot. They are not going to know what it's happening and they're not going to sign up. Okay. So above the full way of that. And then the next thing, and this is different. If you, if this is your very first event ever, you can't do this, but if this is your second event, um, what you do with the event footage, you create what we call an after movie. Okay. An after movie is like a trailer. And so this is an after movie. So the sales that are, uh, showing them what happened last year. Um, but then talking about why they need to come this year. Right. And so if you want to see the actual after movie, I think that this is one of the things we do best inside of our company, our after movies. Uh, but if you go to funnel hacking live.com, obviously you can go and watch this video when you watch it, feel the energy. It feels like a movie trailer. That's what we're trying to get. Now, if you haven't done the event yet, it's hard to do an after movie. Obviously I had one friend who, um, he was going to do an event. So he actually rented the studio, brought in a bunch of actors and taught Frank an hour and made an after movie like that. I don't recommend that. Um, you know, you can obviously do a more traditional video sales there, but you talking about what you're creating, why it's important stuff like that. Um, so that's kind of what this is right here. Okay. And then again, above the fold, we have the, the option by the ticket. So all that is above the fold again, because I'm going to be sending people here so consistently month after month after month to fill the event. I don't want to hide those things. Then you have the spot ticket tickets, the dates, after movie of what the events about, and then a spot to have your, your, um, the, then buy tickets right off the gate. Okay. So those are the core most important things that after that, then we come down and I'll say, okay, now let's get people excited about who's actually speaking there. Right. So for us, we kick it off with whoever our keynote is. Obviously Tony Robbins, the keynote for funnel hacking my 10, um, which is by the way, the last funnel hacking live. So I'm showing you my secrets now because it's not going to matter because, uh, this is last time I'm doing a big event like this. Um, so we lead off the keynote from there and then boom. Now we started story to our people. Okay. Um, again, one of the most powerful things we've done inside of our community is giving people a name. So it's like dear funnel hacker. Uh, and then from here, we start talking to him, right? So let her directly to the person who we're trying to get to come. And so we tell the story. So what's the story for us? This is our last funnel hacking live ever we've done for 10 years. I'm telling the story. Right. So there's the story about what we're doing. Right. You buy, you don't remember, uh, one of my frameworks talk about a lot hook story offer, right up here. This is all the hook, Tony Robbins, the hook. Now you transition to story. Here's the story. This is the last dance is Russell. I'm crazy. Why is he doing this? Right. So I'm telling the whole story and then I'm introducing the offer. Right. So the offer is like, you're going to come and learn how to become one of the radicals. Um, and I talked about the radical is, then we talk about the awards. So these are all the things that are happening in the event. Okay. Again, it's just a long form cells that are showing that they've never transitioned to who are the people that are speaking. Um, and, uh, we don't tell all of them, right? One of the biggest things like curiosity is one of the most powerful, uh, tools we have inside of marketing. So when you're like, here's all the speakers, then a lot of times like, Oh, I know that person. I don't, and it could be a draw, but also make, Oh, I've heard these people speak before, right? And so, uh, you'll notice, um, that, um, you know, we have some people that are secret, right? Mr. X, I have so many of my friends mess with who's Mr. X, who's Mr. X, right? So I show kind of a, a view of who the speakers are. And then from there, um, we come down and we start walking through the schedule. Okay. Here's day number one. Here's who's speaking. Here's what's happening. Here's what we're going to talk about. Do you get more details about that? Right. You get a picture of angry Russell doing with the fist. So very intense there. Uh, day two, tell the stories of the speakers who's coming through. Right. Um, cause you've seen one speaker they want to connect with them to come and say, okay, I'm going to get my tickets. Day number three, right? Mr. X, we leave a, some curiosity there. And so we're showing all of them people that are speaking, who's, you know, why they're speaking, all that kind of stuff. And then come back down after we introduce all the people, uh, then come back down to the call of action, which is get your tickets for Vegas and then the order from right here on the page. Okay. Um, okay. A couple of things we do, um, obviously for us, ticket prices are a thousand bucks. They fill it out down here. And then, um, we add the replays for $97 and it's crazy what percentage of people take that. So it's a great order form bump. Uh, also, if you want to bring a partner and click on there, this takes some custom coding to be able to do this, but then they can throw in their partners names right here. If they want to bring in one partner, three partners, five partners, right? And so what's nice about this is it increases your average cart value. How much, how many tickets people are buying at one time, right? Uh, cause a lot of times they want to take it for them and their spouse, their business partner. So you give them the bill in order form to do multiple tickets and multiple people take it. In fact, if you look back here on the order form, you can see that the average card value, so on average people spend $1,300 when they buy a ticket, even though it tickets only 997, right? So most people are buying something else in the funnel. And this is the core things right here are the, the partner plans and then the, the replays. Okay. And the down here, we have FAQs, which are always powerful inside of, um, funnels, but especially event funnels, cause so many things, you know, like other sponsorship opportunities, what's the event schedule going to be like? When's the deadline? Like all these kinds of things. There you go. That's all the info for page number one here inside the funnel. Now it turns into page number two. So they just bought their ticket. They're so excited. Now what we do is then, and this is the first year we've done this, we've been doing this for 10 years and we finally just, um, we finally have done that. You know, finally added this and looking back now, I've lost tens of millions of dollars in my hard to do this, but what we decided to do is we decided to add an extra day, a bonus day ahead of time. So Dan Kennedy wanted to do a Dan Kennedy day. So we attached it to the front of funnel hiking live. So the day before, and so it's basically like, Hey, you're coming to funnel hiking. Anyway, we want to come a day early and then have my mentor, Dan Kennedy, actually teach you stuff, right? And boom, so I have a video here. I'll be basically saying that. So can you notice the page? We can grab some on getting their seats before you go read this page. Uh, it's only available FHL ticket purchasers. And then how would you like to meet my mentor, Dan Kennedy, boom, and then video, and then right here. And then I wanted to make this very visually, like when we first had this funnel, it was confusing. Like it was in the copy, like there's day ahead of time, but like, I like it. Me, I'm very visual. So I'm like, I want to make sure that people understand this. Right. So that's why I came up with this idea for this graphic. Okay. So here's funnel hiking live right now. You come a day early. You get a special day with Dan Kennedy. Right now it's like 40 something percent of people who buy ticket or buying this upsell. So this one is one of the easiest ways to add an extra $800 to, uh, to your ticket cells by adding a pre-day, right? Um, and so yeah, this is one of the most powerful things we've done. I wish I'd done this back at FHL number one, but unfortunately we did. Right. And again, you can do it with just above the fold. Um, and then obviously my team and I, we get excited and we like write long form copy as well. So we've got a whole long form cells that are down below. Um, and then they can get their tickets here to upgrade or they can say, no, thanks. Okay. And then from there it takes you to the last page, which is just like, thank you. Check your email, put it on your calendar, book your hotel, get the room blocked, join the community, all that kind of stuff. So those are the core pages there inside of the event funnel. Okay. And again, they're pretty simple. They're pretty easy. That funnel, something any of you guys can do. Um, then from there on a transition to, uh, just cause again, I told you guys that this is like a 10 month process. And so, um, yes, this is like the final desk station. So we're pushing people to go and get their tickets, but it's not the only thing we do. In fact, um, when people join me in a circle, a lot of them join because they want to learn event marketing, how do we fill the vent? And one thing that I tell them is that, uh, again, I told you earlier, like events are the hardest thing to sell. And so it's a consistent grind. We're always talking about it. Right. So what happens is for us funnel hacking live ends and then we got 12 months before the next one. So the next two months, you just like catching our breath, breathing. And then two months later, that's when we start. And so the first thing we do is at that time we've got the after movie done, right? So the first thing we do is we post the after move, the headline and a ticket and like, Hey, you guys, FHL tier two months ago was amazing. Check out the after movie. You can go check out what happened. If you want your tickets for next year's FHL, go get them right now. Right. Boom. That's the first pass. Right. And we don't get a ton of people, but I get some noting. Okay. It's happening. Here's the dates. I'm looking at the calendar and we start to sell, start happening. Right. And the goal with, uh, an event is just like, it's funny because we do huge campaigns all the time, like big promotions, big webinars. And I'm always in my head thinking, we're going to sell 1000 tickets in one day. We never do. It's a constant, consistent grind. It's like we sell 20 tickets today, then 15 tomorrow, then three and then 18 and then 32 and then 12. And like it's more of a constant, consistent thing. And so you've got to keep like ringing that bell, ringing that bell, ringing that bell over time for it to work. Right. So on my podcast, I start talking about funnel hacking live during Facebook lives and when I'm going on other people's podcasts, like in my email, I'm just keep talking, making push people back to it. Right. So the first big push is, um, is the after movie. And usually with the after we have a ticket discount. Right. So then after that's done, right? After movies done, take a discount. Then we go back and we start asking in speakers. Right. And then what happens is now I got to get people a reason to buy tickets. What I'll do is in, I'll start introducing, Hey, so and so we just got Tony Robbins, be our keynote. You don't ever take it yet. Go get it. And then we go back to the sales page. Right. We'll add the 20 Robin section with the order button. Okay. They come back and we get some more speakers. Like to keep introducing speakers, introducing. So it's give me a reason to talk, another reason to talk, another reason to talk. Right. So I keep doing that over and over and over again. Right. So that's what that's what starts happening. Then after that, then it transitions and, um, and, uh, we start getting more into like the, the ticket buying motion, right? We need, and so now we start hitting people from different directions, different angles. So like, for example, in fact, right now we're 30 days away from me filming this about 30 days away from funnel, I can live right now. I'm interviewing each of the speakers live on Facebook and Instagram and YouTube. I go live interviewing them and I push them back to page. Right. So I keep pushing them back to this core funnel to make the actual transaction happen, but extra and doing all sorts of things, the ads, podcasts, revealing speakers, announcing speakers, all that kind of stuff. Now I'm going to show you two other funnels that we've also used inside of our campaigns to get people to go and actually buy tickets. Okay. The first time I show you is called the FHL story or the funnel hacking live documentary. So, uh, after like four or five years of doing FHL, we actually made a documentary. So that, you know, obviously a lot of you guys probably don't have a documentary yet. You can't do this, but think about some version of this. It could be a YouTube video. It could be something, but it's, it's trying to tell the story. You people excited about the whole thing. Right. So what we do is we have this, this, uh, page FHL story.com and we drive people. Right. So as I'm talking about fun, I can live, um, I'll come back in every year. I do this. Mike, Hey, you guys, we made a documentary showing behind the scenes of fun, I can live this weekend, you and your kid just sit down and watch this. Right. And we'll do a whole weekend campaign where you drive people here to go watch the documentary. Right. So come here and they can see some of these trailers. These are little trailers for the documentary. Get some excited. They put the email address in. So this is page number one, the funnel. Okay. So again, it's just, this is, uh, getting people to watch a documentary. So, uh, a couple of things, you know, there's three trailer videos here. So when someone hits this page, then we retarget those people with these ads as well. So we'll get retargeted with the trailer, very good. Come back and watch to the documentary and retargeted with another trailer video, another trailer video. So all these trailers pushed back to the documentary and they opt in and then take them to the actual documentary page and it's page. Very simple. There's a headline and then we just let them watch the entire, uh, 90 minute long documentary, which tells the story of funnel hacking live. And some people hear the story about funnel hacking live. They get bought into the idea, the concept, um, the whole thing. And then they're more likely to want to actually experience it. Okay. So one of the things I've learned in marketing, if you can make your audience feel like they're part of the process, they're more likely to want to connect into it. Right. So I used to do this when, um, when I was launching new products, I would like, in fact, you probably see now as I'm writing new books, right? I tell the stories about the books I share behind the scenes. I talk about what's happening. Like, and so people are like, they're on this journey with me and they're as excited about the creation of it as I am. Right. So this whole FHL documentary is like to get them to be able to, to experience the creation with it. Right. So you can make a version of this when you filmed yourself planning the event, calling the speakers. In fact, we've done that in the years past where I feel myself inviting every single speaker, we made a video about that and we sent that out to everybody. Right. It's a lot of fun things you can do, but conceptually you see what I'm doing. Like I'm creating a reason to promote and a reason for them to get a ticket and getting them to feel invested in the event that I'm trying to get them to come to. Right. Now, as well on this, uh, FHL story, uh, we have a lot of other cool things up here. Like, you know, there's the documentary, but over here's over the years, over the years we, uh, we have, uh, basically when the fun hiking lives over, we do as we go back through and we take the after movie. Right. And we post that here. So this is the after movie from the very first funnel, I can I've ever, someone can come and they can watch. Then over here we come back and they do fun like a live 2016. So when someone, when someone comes back here, opt-in's, uh, FHL, uh, story, a couple of things happen, right? Number one, obviously I pushed them to watch the documentary, but number two, I started putting them in email sequence. Like, let me tell you the story. We had here's 2015. What happened in 2016 would happen. Right. And we show like, you just have a, have a registrants have the budget was how much we raised for charity, how many speakers and we show like our key notes. And like we tell the whole story about that one, which is really fun. Right. They can go through, they can see all the different years. Uh, this is 2022. Right. Same thing. 5.2 million on the budget. How much was donated like key notes. Anyway. So that's just again, reasons to talk to them, reasons, send messages, reason for people to get excited. And when it happens, when they go through this, they have a chance to go watch. 10 different after movies for fun, like in lives, it's more experiences, uh, than wanting to come and actually see it. Do you have a funnel, but it's not converting 99.9% of times it's because you have a good funnel, but you suck at selling. If you want to learn how to sell, so your phones will actually convert and get your tickets to my next selling online three day event by going to selling online.com slash YouTube or clicking on link in the description down below. And the next thing we do is I was like, okay, all these other ones, it's like, these are documentaries or stories, but like, I want to give, I want to funnel the gets people excited about like experiencing fun. I can like, like seeing what some of the speeches look like. Like, like, why should I be in that room? Right. That's what we added this little backstage pass tab right here. When you click on that, it takes you to a whole nother funnel. Okay. So it says for the first time ever, watch these live raw, unedited secrets. We found on the cutting room floor. These controversial presentations can't be found anywhere else, but here we have to hurry and pull them offline with the clock hit zero. Right. So they come here and they register and then from there, um, they register. And basically what we did, um, is it, it gets them to watch the documentary if they haven't yet, right? Which is again, very, very important. Uh, and number two, it gives them free speech, uh, but 10 free speeches. They get here at Frank Kern's speech, Prince of Y's speech, uh, Julie's speech, these are some of our favorite speeches, Russell's speech, Dean's speech, uh, Jamie crosses, Pedro's. So he has some of our favorite speeches. We plug those in here because they see that. Like, wow, that's what's happening. Fun Hockey live. I need to be part of that. Right. So they opt in. And then what happens is after you put your email address in here, they put it in there. It takes you to the thank you page and we're using a webinar fuel to basically, um, to, to Daisy Cheney's webinar. So the very first webinars for Hockey live and the next webinar would be the first presentation. So every day, the next 10 days are going to get one of these presentations. Okay. And so the thank you, the, you know, they watch right here, they download this app called Webby, um, they can download it. And, um, I actually, right before we got here and check it out when I did that, it sent me a text as well saying, uh, yes, you finally locked FHL's 10 favorite presentations for free. You can watch the first video here by, uh, right now. So I click on that and on my phone, it'll actually take me directly to my phone. Uh, and if I open the app, there you go. So you start showing me the actual documentary starting. Uh, there you go. So it watches, so it pushes the actual documentary here. And then the next day it pushes, pushes presentation number one, then number two, the number three and number four starts pushing all those. And so it happens as they keep seeing these experiences over and over again, and they're more likely to be back. I need to be in that room, man, that presentation of three years ago was so good from 10 years ago, so good. And at each presentation at the end of it, they hear me pitch them on why they need to go get their tickets at funnelhackinglive.com. Okay. So again, all these different funnels, all keep pushing back to funnelhackinglive.com. Funnelhackinglive.com keeps pushing it back over and over and over again. The, the number one thing that we found that drives ticket sales is we have to take something away. Okay. Um, what does that mean? Um, again, I told you as, as we've wrote funnelhackinglive or any event, it's like, it's never this big, huge rush in sales. It's always like this trickle that keeps happening consistently over time. Right. And so for me, it's like, how do I, how do I cause people to go and buy now? And it's really hard to do. And the only thing we found against people to buy right now is you have to take something away. What does that mean? Okay. So during the campaign, if I have a 10 month campaign or six months, how long it's going to be, I start introducing these things where I'm going to introduce something and I'm going to take it away. Okay. So the very first thing I do is I introduce is their ability to buy tickets at a discount. Right. So when I first launched the event, tickets are on sale for whatever, 697 or $797 dollars or whatever it is. So I introduced the price, I give it to them and then I take it away. So basically we have the watch the after movie discount tickets and then for, you know, 72 hours, whatever that is, then it's okay. The price is going up to the normal price, which is 997. And so I take that away, take away the discount price, boom. And I get the price of 997. Okay. Now the next thing I'd introduce is I haven't introduced the speakers, right? So I introduce the speakers, but then what I do is I have every speaker give a speaker bonus, right? So I'm giving them something. So you get your tickets, you're going to get this speaker speaking. Here's the bonus. Here's next speaker speaking. There's the bonus. So I walk through all the speakers, all different bonuses. So I introduce those things after they're in that campaign. That's okay. You've seen all the speaker bonuses. These are now available for 72 hours and then we're getting rid of them. I'm going to pull them away. Right. And so then we, uh, we announced like the speaker bonus is disappearing. And so we're going to take them away in 72 hours. We have a whole campaign 72 hours, 48, 24, 12, six, three hours from now. And what happens is you see huge spike in sales and then we take it away and then the cells drop back down to normal trickle. Right. And so, uh, and then, uh, so I'm always introducing things that then like, we'll introduce like replays from the last 10 years of events. And then we take that away and then you get this, then we take away, but giving those things and taking away is the best way to increase sales dramatically. Um, one of the, the problems a lot of people do is they try to raise the price too early. I found as soon as you raise price, uh, you know, it's like the last stop is to raise price. So for me, usually it's the week before and we do, we do a raise price or sell it. So it's like, Hey, either we're going to double the price or we're going to sell out whatever happens first, go and then we do a whole campaign or that. We get our last big huge surge of sales before the event actually happens. And then we always sell out. So that's kind of the game plan of what we do. Okay. So I'm going to take you guys over into Barnum where you can actually get copies of all of the, the swipe files from these funnels. All right. Now Barnum PT is kind of like chat, dbt and PT Barnum had a baby and this is the free Chrome plugin we created for you guys to be able to do all your funnel hacking in one spot. And again, it's a free tool. If you go to Barnum PT.com, but what's cool about this is I already used Barnum to go and take screenshots of all of these different funnels that I showed you guys today. So if you want, you can click on link in the description down below and what happens, I'll actually import the entire swipe file into your Barnum PT account for free right now. In fact, let me show you what it looks like. Now the way Barnum works is this little plugin right here. You can see there's a little hat. You click on that and it gives you all these really cool funnel hacking tools you can use. So let's say for example, you want to go and get a screenshot of just the section right here, you can grab it right here and boom, it takes a screenshot. That part of the page and it saves it to your Barnum PT account, which is really cool. But like I said, I already funnel hacked all these pages for you. And so what you can do, so this is what it looks like in the back office of Barnum PT. And you can see this is my swipe file sections. These are all different swipe files, all my favorite funnels. And so I took these three event funnels I just showed you and you can see all of the swipe files are in here. So here's the funnel hacking live 10 funnel you click right here and you can see here's page number one. There's page number. So you can see all the pages. That way you can use them as a model when you're building out your event funnels. Over here is the FHL documentary funnel. Again, you can see all the pages for this funnel here. And then number three is the FHL backstage pass funnel. You see all the pages that funnel right here.
