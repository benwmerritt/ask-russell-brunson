My guess is that probably half of you guys don't even know about this part of ClickFunnels. A big part of the mission is to help you guys to get your message out to sell your products to make more money but on the flip side of that I'm hoping that throughout this whole weekend you're seeing like the power of what you can do with with money with funnels and so when we first launched three years ago I'm curious how many guys even knew this so did you know that every single time any of you guys builds a funnel we donate one dollar towards an organization called World Teach Rate how many guys were aware of that I mean it had no idea that was even happening most of the room crazy get more back right here we're in Paris in Minneapolis on our way to Nairobi, Kenya so you guys have actually been donating how much money so we want to kind of show you guys what's happened over the last 12 months so to do that we're gonna bring up two of my favorite human beings on planet Earth Stu and Amy McLaren you guys come on up whether you realize it or not ClickFunnels have been contributing and what we love to do is we love to show where that is actually going and in the last 12 months a lot has happened we want to kind of bring you behind the scenes and show you what the ClickFunnels community has done I was in the car for ever, I was asleep back there, everyone's passed out of the back, we're talking about we're wide awake much need a bath to break Dave do you have a bath to break? It's just so bad but here's what happened it was actually at a mastermind with Russell basically when Russell wants to do a family vacation he'll invite a bunch of people to come and basically pay for the vacation and that was one of those it was in Pirates Cove and he encouraged me to share it with everybody and several other people there said I'm in for a bathroom and before we do it we had enough to build the whole school Here there's Shalom This is the first school we came to in 2002 I mean 2012 not 2002, I'm so bad at years Okay, Kolei, do you guys know what's about to happen? Oh my gosh, we're here The kids are all lined up We're going to welcome that as well though Happy New Year Wow Welcome to the city Happy New Year Happy New Year That's the first one and then the high school back there Oh my gosh, look at all these classrooms Alright so then in 2016 at Funnel Hacking Live everyone in the audience decided to help build a school and so we actually built this entire these two classrooms right here as a funnel hacking community so check this out this one right here We call it the Future Funnel Hackers Right there and this is the classroom where they're learning English and math and then down here is the more funnel university Welcome to the city of Manusia and Shalom Mareipo Welcome, Mareipo, we are happy to see you today to be down in Manusia to us Shalom Mareipo This is the first school for us Thank you very much for us to send you that idea and you voted and it has really materialized May God bless you, may God bless you, may God bless you Many of the children that you see many of the young families are broken families others are the head of the young families especially right from the background of the violence I was working when we had the post-election violence although we were not going out we would hear a lot of shots and then watching the news to a point where I got depressed we were not turning on the television because of the depressing news it was fire, people were burning, it was really bad It all began some few days before the elections two or seven general elections was delayed well one candidate thought the elections had been rigged so they really mess with the people who are supporting them and they tell them this is what you do they even incite them, fight the people who had it worst hundreds of thousands were displaced most of the displaced persons were not exactly poor people so some of them lost everything like IDPs are people who have been relocated from their homes they are relocated in a big chunk of land it's in the middle of nowhere with no amenities no nothing and basically they are like refugees but within their own countries no school, no hospital, no nothing so for us we specifically focus on education that's what I call mission which is what we have found that is the most important because it starts bringing the community together there is great hope in what you are doing it shall not be forgotten even by God, God you bless you between now and next year many things will have happened it's been a long journey so many people have really devoted themselves and we really thank you guys for the good work you have done in our schools and continue impacting them and just making them what they are the gift that we are giving them is so much bigger I mean it's a couple thousand bucks for us it's not that big of a deal but for them it's like future and hope and they just want us to be proud of them and realize how much it means to them it's cool so it's just fun to go back to Salome today after seeing Jane this weekend and remembering we met her and the word in my mind is hopeful it's so cool to see the transformation each time we come from each of the communities I'm excited for these guys and all of you guys alright so we survived night one in the tent it was a little cold last night but now it's suns up, beautiful we had breakfast and I'll show you guys what's happening alright so this is the tent so everyone is packed we can go all the way down here and then this is the actual school right there which is awesome and there's about 300 kids on their side waiting to wrestle with us so we're going to be heading out there in a few minutes alright now it's time to go get to work so we've got painting projects we've got whole digging projects we've got all sorts of fun stuff so planting all the plants the biggest place is more beautiful yeah it's going to be so gorgeous in a year just we are going to first sand the walls down on these chips and then we're going to clear up the debris with our brush painting heavy, painting heavy they're having us do the primer because they don't trust us with the real coat rightly so here we go and all the kids love getting to paint man, women, kids, boys, girls, everyone so that's kind of fun you see the sea beautiful hi hubby we just found the bridge that we've been looking for yeah hi I love it Jurassic Park now the show must go on for the tour this is one of their homes the kitchen here oh wow this is their next door neighbor he's 92 years old alright so we're about to bring these pencil bags to our classroom so our classroom every year you name the classroom this year we're going to do it for our kids names so we mushed their names together the problem is that it's like a license plate you only have x amount of characters and we've got five kids we have smooshed all their names into one super name there's Eleanor Dallay Whiddon each of these classrooms most of the ones here are built by the funnel hacking community so this is the lady boss learning center this is Brandon and Kaelin from lady boss this delivering wow classroom this is from Anissa and this is one of our funnel hackers this is your classroom this is my classroom kibbin toby who took all the club winners they donated and came not only to donate money they donated their time to actually come here good morning everybody second day of camp leaving the tents and then they're doing a big huge celebration later on today with about 1000 people all the villagers are coming here to dedicate the school and we're about to get the opening ceremony started look at all the cars coming in it's the whole convoy of cars the governor's here here's the convoy's celebration so just a big thank you to both of you guys for always being a huge support and just a huge thank you to you guys for being a huge support and just a huge thank you just a huge thank you to the ClickFunnels community you guys have been unbelievable and the more success you have the more impact we're able to have as well so keep cranking up those funnels baby we told our community all about all of you we told them how special you are and our community wanted to help now there are tens of thousands of entrepreneurs who every day are working to raise money for you so for every time you guys have a funnel that goes live we donate a dollar towards World Teacher and we save that whole thing up and we don't tell what your name is until right now so since this time last year you guys have built 133,737 funnels that have gone live inside of the car holy cow that's unbelievable I don't want to hug all of you that's unbelievable I mean that's a credit to you guys for all the funnels you guys are cranking up we're just very very grateful to be part of this community we look forward to that'll build more than a whole school very very grateful one funnel away one funnel away we want fun confusion sucked we are we want click funnels we want fun it's been fun watching it over the last 10 years because so many things that one person can do when they have a dream and a vision and they can go after it and I think we take it for granted we all have basic needs but they don't have that and if we can give them those things then they have the ability to impact and change change someone's life one other cool story we had this guy named Leonard who he had gone to some school and we had to drop out because he couldn't afford it we helped finish his college education with him, hardly anything like a couple hundred bucks to help him finish his college education and when we came here this trip he was so excited he drove three and a half hours on a little motorcycle to come and we saw him he wanted to show us, he brought his diploma so he could show us do you only had five children? I didn't know he had five, I think I had three you do, we have five too I said, oh so proud of you oh my gosh, Leonard and he said you don't understand what this did he said when I got this diploma I kept my graduation gown on and my whole village had a celebration he said I told all the kids that because I got a diploma all of you guys need a diploma from one person succeeding this whole village now I believe they can succeed and you look at the ripple effect from that when you start figuring out how to give and how to serve your mind opens up the possibilities I believe God like expands your capacity because he knows he can trust you with this I'm making more money, I'm making my new Lambo and all these things, he's like no I'm going to bless this person because he's using this increase to help somebody else we had this thought like well when I'm successful then I'll donate money and it's like no like figure that out now and then your mind will be expanded to figure out how to get your own needs and other people's needs met and when you start looking things that way your mind is just open for me I believe it's like revelation comes to you because it's like I'm trying to figure out other ways to serve you
