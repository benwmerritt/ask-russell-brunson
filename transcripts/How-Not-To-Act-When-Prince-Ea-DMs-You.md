What's up, Russell? Russell, where are you at, man? Where are you at? Well, we're excited. Should we tell the story that this whole thing came about? Yeah, let's do it. Let's tell it. Okay. I'm doing my thing on Instagram and also in one day and I see that he liked something that I did. I was like, there's no way that he's even aware that I exist on this world. I was like, whatever. I don't know, maybe a week or two later, I get this message. He's like, hey, brother, currently reading your book. So amazing. I was like, what? So like take a snapshot of, I'm saying to every single human being I know on this planet. And then again, I'm trying to be all cool. And so, dude, I'm a huge fan of yours. And I was like, oh man, I'm such a loser. Like what did I say? Why did I say it that way? They ask you how you are. You just have to say that you're fine. And then he goes on a couple of days later, feelings mutual now can't wait until you dive deeper into your work. First of all, that's a real text message. That's a real deal. On May 30th, he said, hey, brother, I want to reach out to you. I finished your book a few weeks ago and it was fired. Thanks for giving all the info and love the way you ended it with Impact and Service. I'm looking forward to diving deeper. And that's when I was like, I wonder if he'd be interested in speaking of Funalaki Live. And so I reached out. We started talking about this a little bit. He's like, well, how about we make something special and something unique for the event and we premiere it there. I said, you're right, sir. You are the boss. You say it without hesitation. That's right. That's why today I'd like to give you something, my letter of resignation. Oh really, Newby? Literally the coolest thing ever. So that was the story from my side. I don't think that different version. No, that's a real snow. Listen, I read this guy's book, Expert Secrets. The humility that you carry, the love that you carry, the grounding that you carry. You might have things that money can't buy, but you also have things that money can't buy, right? Like the family and the love that you share, the constant service that you emit with every step you take on this planet. I'm a fan.
