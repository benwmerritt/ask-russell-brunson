## Transcript
Hey, my name is Russell Brunson, and we need to talk about something really important. And no, not the fact that some guy dressed like Batman hanging out over my shoulder. His name's actually Jim Edward. He thinks he's Batman, don't tell people. But really quick, I've been watching a bunch of videos on YouTube today about how to make $100 in a day, and most of them were so bad it was painful. And I thought, if you're watching this, try to figure things out, you need to learn some basic, fundamentals about marketing and business. And so, my buddy Jim and I, his name's Jim, not Batman. We made a really cool video that's gonna show you how to make $100 a day. I hope you enjoy it. And really quick, before you jump into this interview, there's a button down below where you subscribe to our channel. Make sure you click on that. That way we'll get more really cool videos like this, where me and Batman are making cool funnels, showing you how to build your company and grow it to at least $100 a day. So what are we doing today, Russell? Yeah, muscle is good. So today we are gonna build some funnels, and kind of like, I think I'll tell you about what happened. So some of you guys, you guys see yesterday, we launched 30days.com. I did. It's like, it's going. I'm coveting the hard copy of that book. It's 30days.com. We have 32.com, what kind of members basically map out a 30 day blueprint. Like they're gonna lose everything today. What would they do on day one? Day two, day three, and they map out the whole thing. So this is what the book looks like. It's actually, this is the sample print. The final one will be this fat though. It's 550 pages, oh goodness. And you open it up and it's got everybody's 30 day plan. Like, here's Traywell. And it's like, what would I do day number one? I would do this. He's like, day number one, I'd do this. Then day number two, I would do this. Then day number three, and he goes through all 30 days. What he would do, he'd go from zero to hero, if all he had left was a click phone account. And then you got the next person, the next person, and anyway, the hard bound's gonna be amazing. So that's 30 days. Right now, it's going live, I went live yesterday. It's been selling like crazy. We have tons of affiliates, we have a big affiliate contest. We're paying out 100% commission. So on the upsell, basically it's $100 to join the one funnel way challenge, where me and Steven Larson and Julie are gonna be yelling at you and pushing you and forcing you to get your funnel done. It's gonna be awesome. It's $100, and then they get the hard bound book. And we're paying affiliates 100% of commission. So I get paid nothing on it. We're just doing this because we wanna serve people. So that means there's a huge opportunity for everyone listening to be an affiliate and make a crap ton of money by saving your friends and giving them the ability to change the world. So what we're gonna do is show you how, using the power of click funnels and funnel scripts, you can create what is an amounts to your affiliate bridge page that you can use to create your own unique offer to go along with this offer as an affiliate. So that you can just not be another me too offer, but create your own value, add value to it and combine it with the value that Russell just described to you and it's just gonna be this giant value Lollapalooza and it's gonna be amazing. So Russell, one other thing that we wanna tell people is by doing this, one of the cool things is that they're gonna be able to cannibalize, excuse me, model, hack some of the copy that you've already done. So this actually couldn't be any simpler what we're gonna show them how they can do. This is awesome. And actually this is the first sales letter I've written in a long time. I wrote most of the sales there. Karen, tag team along with me and then she did the episodes or stuff like that, but homepage, I'm really proud of it. So just saying. Most people think that if you have to create an email, if you have to create a sales page, if you have to create ads, you have to create teasers, all this different stuff that each one of those is a separate thing that has to be created individually. When we talk about cannibalizing copy or hacking copy, basically Russell's already done all the heavy lifting and unless he loses his mind in the next 24 hours, he doesn't care if you hack his copy that he already wrote because you're gonna use it to sell his product. So any headlines you need, any bullets you need, anything you need other than your own spin and your own bonus are already done for you. You can just model what Russell's already doing. We already did all the hard work. Right. The page yet like, yeah, we killed ourselves on this page. It's converting insanely well, so you know it works too. Right, so your job as an affiliate is to get people over to this page as fast as you can in a way that has them set up to want to sign up. That's the whole point of doing an affiliate bridge page. So in my mind, I don't know if you wanna draw this out to just kinda show people what you think, what you think you would wanna do, but if you were an affiliate promoting this page, Russell, what do you envision your page, your bridge page would look like just keeping it as simple as possible? Okay, I'm gonna open a paintbrush here and I'll doodle it here. Okay, so here over here is the 30 Days page that you are promoting. Right. If you don't have an affiliate link, it's very easy to get one. All you do is go to 30days.com and at the very top here there's a button that says, Affiliate, you click on this button right here and then you can join our affiliate program. Oh, we need to put our video here that I made for the affiliates. But if you're already a ClickFunnels affiliate, you can go into your regular ClickFunnels affiliate account and grab your link there. Yes, very true. If you're already an affiliate, then the link is there. All right, so then what we have to do basically, like Jim said, we've already done all the hard work, the copy steps here, so you're looking at this and okay. Now, if, and I'm always thinking about when I'm an affiliate, like what's the offer? So we already know, like I created a really good offer, but now you're competing against any other affiliate you want to do, so how can you make this offer even better, what can you do on top of it? So you come back and you build a bridge page. There's a couple ways to do bridge pages. Would you do opt-in and then bridge page or just straight bridge page? On this one, honestly, I would just do straight bridge page. I know that that's, I know that you talk about you want to build the list and stuff, but it just, in this one, it just feels like to me, I don't know, you could do it either way, but my thought was just to do straight up, just bridge right to it. Okay, cool, so here's the Facebook ad over here, right? And then you're driving from Facebook ad over to your bridge page. So your bridge page is basically, it's like, it's really something I'm basically trying to figure out, or tell them what it is. Like here's the hook, right? So I've already told you the hook is like, what if you were suddenly losing everything? So for you, I'd be looking at, okay, how does this hook tie back into my world, my life? And so some of you guys are spot where like, this is your reality, like I just didn't lose everything. I'm completely bankrupt, I'm broke, whatever. And so maybe it's you saying like, I'm gonna be a reporter, I'm gonna go on this journey with you and say, look guys, there's this thing, like you said, you can hack this stuff. So I take Russell's headline and bring it over here and be like, you suddenly lose everything, dot, dot, dot. What would you do, right? So you model my headline? I wouldn't model the headline, I'd steal that headline and just play at the top of the freaking page. And then I have a video of here talking about bridging the gaps. So call us a bridge page, because you're bridging the gap, right? Right. Just like, hey, Russell Brunson, you may have heard of me before, he owns Big Thing Called Click Funnel, that's really cool. In fact, recently he was number 76, sorry, I just happened to have a sit in my desk. For Click Funnels, he's helping people build all these funnels. Where's the, it's this camera right here, okay. Oh, so we can tell people that now? I think so, yeah. Okay. It's in the newsstands, or we're 76. They're great. 70 something. Anywho, so like there's, they're killing it. And tons of people making money inside funnels, and I've always wanted to, but I've always struggled. So I went and got these 30 day plans, it's awesome. All these people have like step by step with you for 30 days, and they're giving the whole thing away for free, and so what I want you to do is I want you to go sign up for it, to get it for free through my special secret link, and when you do get signed up, but the cool thing is on the next page, after you sign up, they have this special offer where you pay 100 bucks, and what you do is you get to be part of this challenge called the One Funnel Way Challenge, plus you get this book and how much other things, it's amazing. So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make special offers. If you join the One Funnel Way Challenge to my link, I'm gonna give you, not only we get all the stuff Russell promised you, so here's me to make my little stack slide, you're also gonna get, boom, what value can you add? I'm gonna do a secret Facebook group, where me and all the people who signed up through me are gonna go together, and we're gonna hold each other accountable, we're gonna do daily calls throughout the challenge, and make sure we do it. And number two, I'm gonna go funnel hack 20 cool funnels, and blah, blah, blah, and number three, I'm gonna, and you just go and make a special offer, why so much you buy from you versus everybody else, and then you gotta link, send them over through your filling to go sign up for the program. And that's it? That's it in a nutshell. Yeah. So I would create a super simple one, just let's, I actually, essentially the link I used, I'll show it here, we're using the Who What Why house script, I filled it out, not for my product, but for Russell's product. And it's actually set here as a preset for so funnel scripts users can just load it all in, whack the button, and then what I did was, it's not a physical, so I used the digital product offer one, and I went through and I kind of edited it, so this was my first draft, and then I recorded it, and actually just sent Russell the YouTube link of the recording that I did this morning for it, so rather than me reading it to you twice, once he gets the page kind of done, he can throw that in there, and he can throw it in the page and you can see it, but I mean, everything else, yes, we used the power of funnel scripts for this, but Russell already did all the heavy lifting, that's the big thing I wanna get across here, is that all the sales copies already done, all you gotta do is just figure out what you're gonna do to sweeten the deal, and then tell the people to go click over on the link, that's one of the reasons why I was saying that we ought to do it just as not even doing it to make them opt in, because that's like the simplest, lowest common denominator thing, I mean, what we're showing you here, literally you could have done in 20 minutes, I literally just basically modeled the headline because hey, it probably already worked, now I'm gonna talk about what my special, did you make a special offer in your video, Jim? Yeah, I did actually, and what I said was that I would give them, I would give them what I would do in 30 days, because... Go ahead. 30 days, stay, forth, breathe. I'm gonna give you my 30 day blueprint. Okay, how's this look? I think it looks cool, I mean that... It's like two minutes. Yeah. 30 days bridge page, okay, so I'm gonna check, oh, actually I don't know what thing I'm gonna do, I'm gonna come here, and if you click on the button here, here's a cool little secret thing for you guys, when you have, if you have your heat maps on your stuff, people click on images like crazy, and so what I do a lot of times is like, we have our buttons here that do something right, so the button will continue to my affiliate link, like I'll make the images do the same thing too. Do I need to get them, how am I gonna contact them? So I need to tell them like step one, go and do the free thing. Yeah, and then step one, go sign up here, step two, and I would have it pop in a new window, and step two would be send me, what I said in the video was forward me your, forward me your confirmation email when you sign up, and then I'll get you my case study. So in effect, what I'm doing is I only wanna get the emails of the people who actually sign up. How's that look? It looks good, and if you really wanted to be lazy, you could have your bonus be on an auto responder, and 90% of the people are just gonna be totally honest, and they're just gonna shoot forward the thing to you, and you don't even have to have your team do it, the auto responder will do it. So on the buttons and stuff, that should say continue to step one, shouldn't it? Step one, sign up here. That continue to step three. You can sign up for 30 days. Dot com. Dot com right now. Yeah. Guys, that was like the easiest funnel ever, and this thing is gonna be super profitable for everybody. So it's smoking cool. I need you to share that with me so I can just use it. I'm just gonna put my affiliate link in there. I'm done, bro. I'm finished. So everyone who, this is your first time Funnel Fridays, if you go to funnelfridges.com, you get this plus all other 49 episodes, because this is our 50th episode, those who are first timers there, and then also for almost every, almost every funnel we build, we give you the share funnel link. So later today, if you go to funnelfridges.com, under this episode, it'll be the share funnel link. So I'm gonna give it an out, and Nick will post in there, and then you guys can click on this, and now you've got your own share funnel for this contest, and you can start throwing it to your friends, your family, run ads to it, and change the world. And switch out the video instead of promising everybody my bonus. Yeah, definitely switch out the video. So, and there we go. Great job, buddy. That, I mean, that really, this, I know in the cool intro video that y'all made, sometimes we do it and sometimes we don't, but we did it today, man. That thing looks good. In the last, in less than 24 hours, this funnel's produced over a quarter million bucks, and most of that is going back towards affiliates. Like, we're well over six-figured in affiliate commissions in less than 24 hours. So this is an opportunity for you guys. Like, if you jump on this, like, some of you guys, this will pay for your car payment, your rent, your house payment, your mortgage. Like, you can do some cool stuff with this. All right, man, well, thanks for building today. Have a good time. Thank you for your job. And hopefully this helps you guys to sell some more 30 days, cover your mortgage, your rent, and have some fun with it. And yeah. Happy 50th. Happy 50th anniversary. Yeah. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha.

Take two. I'm Batman. Hey, this is Russell again. I hope you enjoyed the interview with me and Batman. We had a really fun time putting together, and hopefully you see how fun and easy to just actually build funnels. Now, a couple things. During this funnel, we built the 30-day challenge.
