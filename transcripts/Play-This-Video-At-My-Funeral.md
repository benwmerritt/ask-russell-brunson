Now how many of you guys have tried to set a goal and you had a goal, you went for it and you achieved it and you got your hand raised, whatever it was, you won a two comic club award, you made a million bucks, you won a state title, whatever your dream was, you had your hand raised, you had a goal and afterwards you're like, huh. Have you ever felt that before? Always thought that happiness was going to come from you achieving the goal, from doing the thing, from getting my hand raised. Like that's what I always thought. I kept doing it and doing it and chasing it and chasing it. It was crazy because I never got the value from that. Happiness gives the state of consciousness and proceeds from achieving the one's values. How many of you guys was family a big value of yours? That's what brings happiness. Not the goal, not the destination, it's the journey, it's these different values. These are what actually bring the long-term happiness. As I started realizing, I was like, oh my gosh, this is amazing. And I started thinking, wouldn't it be cool if we could be there when we died someday and so they're listening to the people telling the stories about how, man, Russell fulfilled this value and this value and this value and this value. And then I started thinking more and more, I was like, man, wouldn't that be cool to write your own eulogy? If you wrote it, then you would know the goal. Right? Because if I achieve this and this and this and this and then at my funeral they're like, man, Russell did this and this, how cool would that be? And so I've been delaying this. You guys are my team. We've been talking about this for over a month. I've been delaying it and delaying it and finally last night I sat down and I wrote my own eulogy. And it was hard. And I wrote it and I stressed about it, went to bed and I woke up this morning and I read it and it was very emotional for me. I want to read it to you guys for a couple of reasons. Number one, I hope somebody will read it in my funeral, but number two is afterwards I'm going to have you guys each spend the next 45 minutes or so and write your eulogy based on the values that you hope that you can fulfill in this life. If this is where happiness comes from or the achievement of our values, I want something. I want something that I can take and I can read it every morning or read it once or twice a week and realize this is the goal. This is the thing. The goal is not wanting it to come. It's not wanting to stay tied to the goals. Who are they going to come? The practical application, the fulfillment of my values is who I became. That's why we're here on earth. It's the whole purpose. God doesn't care how many two common cohorts I win. He doesn't care how many state titles he cares who I become. This is showing my values. Did I become who I wanted to be? I'm going to read mine. I'm so scared and nervous about this. This is a very vulnerable thing, but I'm going to do it anyway. My name is Russell Brunson and I love my life. I always believe that the short window of time that God granted me to be here on earth was a gift and I wanted to be a good steward at the time I was given. I was raised by great parents with strong values. They loved and served God and they taught me to do the same. They were hard workers and taught me the value of hard work. They loved each other and showed me through their example how to have a great marriage. I realized how rare it is to be raised in a home with two parents who love each other and I always looked at this as one of my greatest blessings in my life. One that I strive daily to pass on to my kids as well. My first love was wrestling. It was something that I was good at and it was something that I could do together with my dad. It was also the first thing that really made me feel any sense of meaning in my life. I worked hard and by my junior year I became a state champion. My senior year I took second place in the country and became an All-American. I then had a chance to spend the next five years of my life wrestling in college. I never reached my goals at the collegiate level, but I loved the journey and who it made me become. When my wrestling career was over, for a time I forgot about my health and my fitness. I was busy trying to create a business and launch a career and my health took a back seat. Almost a decade later after feeling too tired each day to be able to play with my young kids when I got home from work, I decided that something needed to change. I spent the next year getting back into shape, relearning how nutrition worked and gaining control over my body again. Throughout the rest of my life I started supplement and biohacking companies to help other entrepreneurs to increase their health so that they could complete their mission and still have time for their families. When I was 19 years old I spent two years in New Jersey serving the people there and teaching them about Jesus Christ. During that time I gained a testimony that he is our savior and that because of him I will be able to live again with my family after this life. When my mission was over I knew that I wanted to continue to bring people to him but I didn't know how. Soon God blessed me with desires to learn into master online marketing. Little did I know that 20 years later I would be able to use those skills that I had learned to help teach the gospel to thousands of people, helping to bring the knowledge of Jesus to people all around the world. When I died I was able to say that I held true to the faith that I loved. When I was 21 years old I met my wife Colette. I quickly fell in love with her and within a few months we were married. I remember feeling like I had found a diamond in the rough and that I saw something in her that I don't think anyone had ever seen before, including herself. I always wished that she could see herself the way that I see her. I remained faithful to her and the commitments and the covenants that I made to her and to God on our wedding day until the day that I died. We were able to bring five amazing kids into this world. Every one of them is so unique and made so many fun memories together. I was that annoying dad that always took too many pictures of them but nothing gave me more happiness than this life. In the late nights when I would scroll through years of pictures, often times with the kids remembering our magic moments together. As they grew older I tried hard to get them to pursue greatness in anything that they did. Most of my pushing was met with a lot of resistance which was hard for me to understand. I was always able to see their potential and believe in them, usually more than they believed in themselves. I tried hard to be a friend, a coach, and a father but even when I struggled at being any of those things I was always their biggest fan. I always struggled in school but for some reason while I was in college God gave me the desires to learn about marketing and became an obsession. I didn't realize it at the time but these desires were the fuel that prepared me for my life's mission to serve entrepreneurs. But before I could serve them I had to experience the highest highs and lowest lows so I would have empathy and understanding when I was able to serve them. During the next 15 years I built and crashed multiple companies that experienced all of the extreme joy and pains in each step of the journey. When I was finally given a chance to be able to serve my people I did so to the best of my abilities. I was a good steward of the ideas that God gave to me and I continued to serve this group until the day that I died. During my life I was able to see the ripple effect that my work had on so many people. This experience, serving those people, was the most filling part of my journey. I was able to use the skills, resources, and influence that I gained from building these businesses to bring people closer to God as well as help fuel multiple charities that aligned with my beliefs and values. I'm also proud that I was able to love people that didn't believe the same things that I did. This was hard for me to do at first but as I grew older I was able to see that each person is a child of God, each on their own journey, trying their best in their given circumstances. I learned to love them for the values that we shared and not judge them for those that we didn't. For those that I'm leaving behind, if I could leave one thing it would be this. I know that you are a child of God and that he loves you. He's calling you to greatness. The first step is to develop the talents that he's blessed you with. If you are a good steward or what he's given you he will allow you to use those gifts to change the lives of those around you. That is how you will find true fulfillment during this life. It's been an honor to be in your presence during this life and I can't wait to see you on the other side. So for me it's like if someday that was able to be said in my funeral as I was going through my values, all those things were touched upon in there. Things that I valued were there and if I could achieve those things then for me in my life I would have become who I was called to be. The whole point of this session is where are we trying to finish that? We have these values, these things that make us happy, that our subconscious mind is craving, these desires, these gifts from God, these are the values. The eulogy is just going to be talking about like this is the fulfillment, I did the things. I became who I was supposed to be coming. If I can achieve my values that's what I want to be, that's how the whole thing, that's what I want someday people to remember me from. I don't care people remember me from my state title, I don't care people remember me from my two comma clubs, anything else. I want to be remembered for the values that actually achieved the things that I set out to achieve, who I actually became.
