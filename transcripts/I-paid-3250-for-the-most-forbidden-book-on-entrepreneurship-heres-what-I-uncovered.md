## Transcript
Throughout the centuries, there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this one thing in common. That the step was first, the road was new, the vision was unborrowed. The great creators, the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors, they stood alone against the men of their time. Every great new thought was opposed, every great new invention was denounced. But the men of unborrowed vision that went ahead, they fought, they suffered, and they paid, but they won. I love this because this is true in any endeavor you do as a creator, as an entrepreneur. When you first put the thing out there, it's probably going to get rejected by most people. What's up this Russell? Welcome back to my vault. Today I'm going to bring out one of my favorite books and it's one that happens to be signed kind of. I'll explain how that works in a minute. But this is a book called Atlas Shrugged by Ayan Rand. It is one of the biggest books. I heard people talk about it for years, recommending. I sat down with it, I put my headphones on, and I read along and I got through the first probably hundreds of pages and I was hooked. And now I've read it every summer since then. It's one of my favorites called Atlas Shrugged by Ayan Rand. This is the first edition copy. I paid $3,250 for this copy and inside, as you will see, it's signed by Ayan Rand. So this is what's called a tipped-in. You see this right here? So what that means is that Ayan Rand signed something somewhere else and then they cut it out and they actually glue it inside of the book. And so it's a different type of signature. So it's still considered an autographed copy even though it's what they call a tipped-in. If you look at how they value books, had she signed this exact copy, it would be worth way more than having a tipped-in, but the tipped-in is still pretty cool. So you see a lot of times people who will find autographs, maybe she autographs somebody's program or something, paper or something like that and they'll cut those out and glue them into a book to increase the value. So it's still a signed first edition, but it's a tipped-in version. So that's kind of the difference for those who are want to become book collecting nerds like me someday. That's what a tipped-in is. So the question always is why this book rustles. And this book is very controversial. Some people love it and some people hate it. The premise of this book is that there are two types of people in this world. There are people who act and those who are acted upon. She calls people who act the producers of society or the prime movers. These are the people who are changing and moving society. I always look at the prime movers of society are the entrepreneurs. They are the creators and the people who are changing things. And so the premise of this book is what would happen if the prime movers of society, the producers, if they had so much outside force from government, from regulations, where no longer made sense to them and they stood up and they shrugged and they walked away from it. What would happen to the world? It's a story where the entrepreneurs, the producers are the hero. Whereas typically if you look at almost every other story in our society, the entrepreneur is the villain, right? Look at any movie like who's always the bad guy. Oh, it happens to always be the evil rich billionaire, right? The entrepreneur is the bad guy. If you watch the Lorax, like who is the evil person, oh, it's the entrepreneur. Every story, every message, the producers are the bad characters. Whereas Atlas shrugged, the producers, the prime movers are the hero of the story. And so I love it because the people that I serve are literally what we call prime movers. In fact, my company, I've got two companies. I got ClickFone, which is my software company. And then we have Prime Mover, which is my coaching and my education company. Here is a t-shirt. If you've seen me wear this, this is the Prime Mover t-shirt. Okay. And this is literally a picture of Atlas holding the weight of the world on his shoulders. Because look at my job, my mission, my role in this community we are is I want to support the prime movers, the people that are literally holding the weight of the world on their shoulders. And so for me, my job is to support the producers so we don't shrug and we don't walk away. We went back 25 years ago. Man, 24, 25 years ago, when I got started in this world, that's when I started being an entrepreneur. I was going to college this time. I was trying to create things on the internet, trying to sell stuff on the internet. And it's crazy. Every single person I met back then, like, what do you do for a living? I'm like, oh, I sell stuff on the internet. And then like, they thought I was a scammer, that I was a spammer. Like, it wasn't a real thing. I remember we first started creating funnels and putting them out there. Like, I was putting funnels out there in different markets. And like, everyone would see my site, it's like, oh, you're one of those people that scam people. Like, what are you talking about? Like, this has nothing to do with scamming people. In fact, I remember the very first event I ever did, trying to teach people about what we were doing. I remember I ran radio ads, we did a direct mail campaign. I ran the holiday in and we had this room set for like 100 people. And I'm doing the very first event ever. I'm so nervous. And two people walked in and one person sat on the front row, one person sat in the back row. And I'm trying to teach these guys like, this is the future. This is how we're going to change the world, right? And it was crazy because either people didn't care what they thought I was a spammer or scammer. It was crazy to me. It's interesting though, because I loved it so much. I was so passionate that I didn't stop. I kept talking about it. I kept doing it. I kept trying to share this message with people, right? It comes back to this like, the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the adventurers, they stood alone against the men of their time. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced. But the men of unborrowed vision, they went ahead. They fought, they suffered, and they paid, but they won. So for me, it's like, I was so obsessed with it. I kept going, kept doing it, right? And the next event had five people, and then 10, then 20. And you fast forward a decade later, two decades later, our last event had over 5,000 people in the room. And it was different. Like, we're in this room talking about funnels and people got it. They understood it. It wasn't weird anymore. Like, you're on it now and take talk or you're gonna be clicking on something. Almost every single ad goes to a click funnel. It's fun. Like, it's no longer like this weird thing. We took this crazy idea, something we believed in. I was so passionate. I kept going and going and going. And eventually, the people showed up. And this is gonna be true for most of you guys. Most of you have a vision. You have something that you love that you're obsessed with something you want to create, right? And you want to get out there. And my guess is when you first start sharing that people around you, they think you're a little crazy. Your friends think you're crazy. Your spouse thinks you're crazy. Your family members, right? Luckily, there's more of this stuff happening today. We've made it more and more normal, less weird. But for most entrepreneurs, they first go into this game. The people around you who love you the most are gonna resist it, right? They're not gonna believe in you. And then you're gonna go out there, you're gonna try and get first, you're gonna fail, right? It doesn't work the first time. You're gonna do an event trying to change the world. Two people show up for it. Nobody cares. But you have to care, okay? If you care enough and you keep doing it and keep doing it, keep showing up and keep sharing your message over and over and over, you know, what's gonna happen is a couple things. Number one, you're gonna get better at your message. It'll become more clear, become more like, like you'll understand how to find your voice. And as you're doing that, more and more people will find you. And you're gonna change their lives. And then you'll change more people's lives. And someday, someone will come up to you at an airport or at a live event or somewhere. And they're gonna pull you aside and they're gonna look at you like, you have no idea but you actually changed my life. And that's the magic. That's what we try to create here. It's what gets me so excited. So I read Alice Strug. For me, it's just, it's the greatest analogy of entrepreneurship. It's the greatest analogy of people like you and me who are creators, who when we go out there, we have this vision for something we're gonna create. Nobody else can see our vision. They can't understand it. They think we're crazy, right? But the people who go out there and with all their hearts and their minds, they will serve and they'll put these things out there, right? And they're doing it because they believe in the creation. They believe in the idea they have. They can literally change the world. And that's what this book is all about for me. Now, obviously, in her book, she wanted the producers to leave so you could see what would happen to the world and see the world collapse. Like the very ending scene, the lights of New York all go out because the producers are done and everything like the power grid ends. Everything just dissipates and ends, right? Which I think is the ultimate tragedy. But you see what happens if it's not for you. Just know as you're going down this path, as you're doing this, you're doing them what the greatest of all time have done. And if you first persevere and you go through it, you will suffer, you will fight, you will pay, you will fight, you will go through pain. But if you stick to it, you will win at the end. And you'll change lives to the customers and the people you've been called to serve. And that's the mission. For me, that is the message from Atlas Shrug that I love so much. It gets me excited every time I read that to step into my calling as a producer to try to change the world. All right. Now, if I was to give you my entire notes from the Atlas Shrug book, it would be like probably 500 pages. And so, but I did want to give you some of my favorite parts. Inside of the book, there is what's called the John Galt speech. And the speech is like 80 pages long. It took Iron Man two years to write this speech. And it's one of the greatest things about the entire thing. It's like this anthem of producers like, like it's one of the greatest things in the world. So what we did is we took the John Galt speech and we've done a summary of that. And so if you go down the link down below, click on that. I'll give you guys a summary of the John Galt speech that I think you will love. Hopefully it inspires you to go read the entire Atlas Shrug book. If not, at least read the John Galt speech because it is like the anthem for producers like me and you. So click the link down below, get the notes from the speech. And other than that, thank you guys. Hope you enjoyed this video. If you read Atlas Shrug, if you love it, let me know in the comments. If you hate it, let me know in the comments. If you watched the video like that movie was not very good, I agree with you. But the book is infinity times better. Ignore the movie. Go back and won't read the book. It'll change your life forever. Thanks so much. We'll see you guys on the next video.
