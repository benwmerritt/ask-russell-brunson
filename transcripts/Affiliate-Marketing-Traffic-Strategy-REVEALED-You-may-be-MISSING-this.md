Okay, with that said, I'm gonna dive into today's video, which you are gonna love. Everyone's always asking me, what's the best way to get traffic? And of all the ways you get traffic, the best way is you get affiliates to promote your products and your services for you. That way you don't have to spend any money on traffic. The traffic comes free and you get tons and tons of it. It's one of the best traffic sources. So right now, this video, when you're diving deep into how to fill your funnel with affiliate marketing traffic where other affiliates are promoting your products for you. With that said, let's jump right into the video. The man, Russell. Pay to sell your product. Love this guy. I honestly believe the entrepreneurs are the only people that can actually change this planet. What we're talking about today is affiliate marketing 101. And this is not like how to be an affiliate. This is how to get affiliates to promote you. So how to fill your funnel with these free traffic secrets, which is really, really fun and exciting. Again, when I started my business, I didn't do it by buying Facebook ads, by buying Google ads, by buying YouTube ads. I didn't know how to do all that kind of stuff at first. I did it by finding affiliates and getting them to promote my products. So if anyone's looking for free traffic, this is the best way to get free traffic that I know of. Okay, so affiliates are me. Like what is affiliates? Affiliates are people who love your product, love your service, and they decide that they're gonna promote it for you. They may already have an email list. They have a big follow on YouTube or Facebook or Instagram or something, and they can go and they can promote it for you. So your job is to figure out who are the affiliates, who are the people I need to go find who already have my dream customers, who can talk about my product or my service. And when I first got started in this game, man, this is probably almost 15 years ago now. This is before I had any kind of business. I remember I was trying to learn this game, and I'm sure some of you guys are not spotting out. You're trying to learn, you're trying to figure things out. And I was trying to learn traffic, and it was confusing to me. I don't understand, there was PPC and SEO and all these things back then that everyone was doing to get traffic. And I remember that one day I was in this marketing forum, back before people use Facebook groups, it was a forum, and in this forum, and someone asked the question of all the ways to drive traffic, which one is the best? And I remember seeing that, and I was like, oh my gosh, that's my question too. Like I don't have time to learn all of them. Like what's the best one to learn? So I logged into the question, I started reading all the responses, and it was so crazy because one person came and said the best way in the world is Google paper clicking, you know, someone else, no, no, no, that's the worst, like the best is SEO, and they're like, oh, that's good, but this type of SEO, and they're like, no, you should be doing cloaking versus this, and all these things, and everyone's fighting over it. I'm just like, this is amazing, watching all these traffic, we'll fight over the best way to get traffic. And I'm watching thread after thread after thread, and all of a sudden, one person came in and dropped the mic, and it was the owner of the forum, probably the wealthiest guy who was in the group at the time. And he came in there, and he posted a really short thing, he said, I rely on my own network of affiliates. I remember reading that, at first I didn't get it, I was like, what? I rely on my network of affiliates, and I read it again and again, and all of a sudden, like, the light bulb hit, and I was like, oh my gosh, I can go out there, and I can learn how to do solo ads, I can learn how to write and send emails, I can build emails, I can learn SEO, I can learn PBC, I can learn all these things, or what if I went out and said, who already is really good at banner ads? What if I found that person, and I said, hey, I'll pay you a percentage of all the sales if you do banner ads for me? Maybe I find three or four or five, or 10 guys doing that. I just 10xed my efforts, I didn't have to learn anything. Maybe I find the person who's really good at PBC, instead of me learning PBC, I'll be finding people who are already good at it, and paying them a commission on every sell they make, and SEO, and the same thing, and that was the light bulb for me, I said, okay, I'm not gonna focus on new traffic strategies, I'm gonna focus on finding those people who I can make my affiliates, okay? And so, this is something to understand, when you have an army of affiliates selling your products or services, you don't have to be good at everything. You can get army of affiliates to promote your products and your services with every type of traffic, they're the best at. The thing that they're most passionate about. Okay, all right, so this is how it works, step number one, you gotta go recruit your army of affiliates, okay? This comes back to a concept we call the Dream 100. I spent a lot of time in the new traffic secrets book talking about the Dream 100, that's the first phase, it's like identifying who are the people who already have your customers, okay? If you don't know yet, now's the time to start looking. Like go online and start googling all the keywords that your dream customers with Google, and then join the email list, follow the Facebook, the fan pages, join the groups, like tie yourself into all the places that your dream customers probably going, and like weave your way in there, and also you start seeing like, oh my gosh, this person sending emails, selling products similar to mine, oh my gosh, this person's got a blog on page number one of Google for all the keywords that I would have searched for, oh my gosh, this person has, is good at SEO or PP, whatever it is, you start finding those people, so step number one is you gotta find them, and you gotta recruit them, okay? That means good old fashioned getting to know people, which I get it for those who are my introverts, I'm super introverted as well, scares me to have to call people on the phone, but this is something that's worthwhile. I'll hit up on Facebook Messenger or DM them, I'll call them on the phone, I'll send them pizzas in the mail, like I do all sorts of crazy things to be able to recruit my affiliates and get to know them, because people promote the people they have relationships with, so you need to get relationships with those affiliates who are part of your dream 100, okay? Tim Ferriss, when he wrote the four hour work week, I told a story in the Traffic Secrets book, it was interesting, he spent a year, like as he was writing the book, he spent a year going out and meeting all the bloggers, getting to know them and became friends with them and built his relationship with all these bloggers, and when they asked him, what do you do for a living? He's like, oh, I'm writing a book, but you know, and that was kind of a, he kind of brushed it off, and then as the book got done, he sent his book to all these bloggers he built relationships with over the last year, and said, here's my new book, if you like it, I love if you wrote a blog post on launch day, it's not, it's really cool. He sent it out and people read the book and they loved it, and day one launch day, he had hundreds of the top bloggers in the world, blog post reviews about his book, and the book went on to become New York Times bestseller and built Tim Ferriss, who is one of the biggest influencers in the world right now, but it all came off of him spending a year recruiting his army of affiliates, sending them out and stuff to get to know them and build up relationships, okay? So step number one, you got to identify your dream 100 and recruit them, step number two, you actually make them an affiliate, okay? So, and started ClickFunnels, if you have a ClickFunnels account, Backpack is the tool you can use that makes and builds an affiliate program, okay? So any funnel you have, selling a product, you just hook a backpack to it, and what happens is your affiliates can log in, and they can go and grab a link right here, and then they can promote it. You can put sample emails for them, sample a banner, add things like that, they can go and grab it, they can promote it, and then when they make a sale through their link, Backpack Software will track it, and each month you can log in and it says, okay, here's all the affiliates you need to send money to. You click a button, it'll send PayPal payments out to everybody, pays all the affiliates, and that's how the affiliate platform works. So we call that Backpack inside of ClickFunnels, but after you find the affiliates, then you got to make them an affiliate, it's really easy to do inside of your ClickFunnels account, and then step number three, you have to give them a reason to promote. Why should they promote? Why should they promote today versus tomorrow? Good affiliates are gonna hit it by everybody in the world to promote, so why should they promote your products? There's a couple reasons. Number one, people like to promote something that's new, a new launch, right? They get excited about the newness of it, so they have a new launch. Number two is some people like, I don't like doing a launch, so you can turn it into a rolling launch, so it's like hey, week number one, you're gonna be the affiliate that promotes this, then week number two it'll be you, and week number three, and you pick different affiliates into one little mini launch to each person's list one at a time, okay? And then the third reason is that people love new stuff, so sometimes you can go to an affiliate, and maybe they're not gonna promote your thing, but make something new with them, like hey, how about you take your superpower, my superpower, and make a product together, and let's promote it to our people that way. And all of a sudden, now you got something co-created that you can create new together that gives them a reason to wanna promote as well. Step number four, now after you've done that, now you gotta train your affiliates, okay? Really good affiliates are lazy because they make so much money they don't even care, and really bad affiliates don't know how to do it, so you gotta, either way, you need an affiliate training center, which are really easy to build inside of ClickFunnels. This is what our affiliate training centers look like. You come in here, and an affiliate can quickly come in here, and get links to all the banner ads, you get videos training them, you can teach people how to run Facebook ads, how to run banner ads, how to do SCL, like you can train affiliates, you don't know what they're doing yet, and then you make the training center, makes it super simple for your existing affiliates, just to go in there, grab what they need, paste it, post it, and they can be on their way. So that's step number four, is training your affiliates, and step number five then is then you actually pay your affiliates. People always ask me, how much do I have to pay my affiliates? I wanna pay them as little as possible, because they wanna keep more money. You don't understand, like, you never wanna, like, take away commissions from a salesperson, right? I wanna get people the biggest commissions possible. So when we launched ClickFunnels, looked at all the other software companies, most were paying like 15 or 20% affiliate commission. I was like, okay, let's double that. So we did 40% affiliate commission, which no one had ever heard of before, right? And then we did the dream card bonus, where we actually paid people's dream cards when they promote, and we tried to make it as lucrative as possible so that affiliates would promote us instead of our competitors. And what was crazy is that when we first got started, there were a bunch of competitors who had a lot of affiliates, and we came in and paid more, and we converted higher, and all of this shifted from those other companies and started promoting us instead. Okay, and so the more you can pay your affiliates, the better. I typically try to pay my affiliates 50% of what we actually make on a product. So if I'm selling a digital product, what's 100% digital, I may be 50, 50 commissions. If it's a physical product, let's say I've got, you know, an e-commerce product where I gotta pay 20% is the hard cost for the product, then I'll take the 20% off the top, and I'll split whatever's left over 50, 50, right? I like to pay my affiliates at least that much. Sometimes though, when we have something like a book or a front-end funnel, we may pay affiliates more. In fact, when we launched both the Dotcom Secrets Book and the Expert Secrets Book, we paid affiliates $20 to give away a free book where someone paid 7.95 shipping handling, we were paying affiliates $20. So we actually lost when we were paying 200% commission on it because we knew that they were gonna buy the product, and some people bought upsells and downsells and they made it so we can, you know, we did break even, and then eventually people bought click funnels in the back, and that's how we made our money. So step number five is figuring out how to compensate your affiliates to motivate them to wanna be able to promote. And so that you guys is how you build an affiliate program, which is again one of the easiest, most powerful ways to get more traffic into all of your funnels.
