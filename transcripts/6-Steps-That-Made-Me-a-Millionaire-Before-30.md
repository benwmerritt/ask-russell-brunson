These are the six steps I follow in my 20s to help me be extremely successful. These are the steps that's like their own rule and if you follow them step by step, you will be more successful in your 20s and prepare yourself for your 30s, 40s and beyond. Biggest problem for most people, especially in their 20s, they've no idea what they wanna do. You go to school and you learn a whole bunch of random topics that don't actually help you and then you get put out in the real world to go do something and most people because they're on any direction, they're just looking like, well, where can I get a job? Where can I find something that will pay me right now? And because they give up their hopes and their dreams and things that actually excite them and they're passionate about it. I think one of the biggest tragedies is when somebody's 65, 70 years old and they're retiring and they've been miserable the whole time because they were doing something they didn't love. So in your 20s, the first thing I'd be asking yourself is like, what do you actually wanna do? What's the thing that fires you up? The thing that gets you excited? Where every morning you wake up and you're like, I gotta go do this today. This is insane that I get paid to experience this and to do this for my living, for my career. And then there's a quote that I love that says, if you wanna be successful in life, all you need to do is to model those who are already successful. That quote came from Tony Robbins. He is the biggest influencer in the world right now. He's been running events now for 40 plus years, changing millions and millions of people's lives. But before he was ever Tony Robbins, the first thing Tony did is he found someone to model to be successful. Like here's a picture I found of Tony Robbins when he was 23 years old sitting in a gym room seminar. If you don't know who he is, he was the Tony Robbins of the 1980s. Starting tomorrow, what are you going to do that'll make a change in your life's direction? And so when Tony decided I wanna be someone who's gonna change people's lives, he said, who's already doing it? Jim Rohn's doing it. So Tony was sitting in Jim Rohn's seminars. Tony volunteered, he started working for Jim Rohn. He was his number one sales trainer. He was his number one speaker. He became part of that. But the first thing is he figured out what did he actually wanna do? And he found somebody who was already doing it. That's rule and step number one. Here's the big challenge of life. You can have more than you've got because you can become more than you are. Let's say again, if you wanted to be in the speaking industry, like Tony Robbins probably went to Jim Rohn and said, for Jim Rohn to be successful, he's gotta sell tickets to the event. He's gotta have speakers, he's gotta have promoters, he's gotta have marketers, he's gotta have people doing sales in the back of the room, he's gotta have people creating courses and content. Like he saw all the pieces that made that business successful. Like if you were to come into my world, like what are all the components of success for a business like mine to be successful? Well, I gotta have a sales funnel, I have to have a sales message, right? I gotta drive traffic, I gotta have copyrighters, I've gotta have people doing email marketing, I gotta have people doing social, YouTube. Like there's all these different skill sets that are involved for me to be successful inside this business. So I wanna look at the business I want to be part of, looking at the thing I want to be my career, and start looking at what are all the different components that make that successful. You don't have to master any of them yet, you have to understand all of them. Cause if I'm gonna go to a Tony Robbins event, and they're like, I wanna work with Tony, I wanna do something like he's doing, I need to understand how all the different pieces work. So I'm gonna look at those five or eight or 10 different things that make Tony successful, I wanna understand them. So what I like to do is I go through what I call binge days. I'm gonna say, okay, I know that for somebody to be successful online, they've gotta understand how to build a funnel. I'm gonna spend a day binging everything on how to build a funnel. I'm gonna write, if there's a book about it, I'm gonna go read one or two books, I'm gonna go listen to every single podcast on it. I'm gonna go and try to find an expert in there, and see if I can get on a call and interview that person. So I have a really good understanding of like, what goes into being successful in this component? Right, and then if I'm like, okay, next component is that someone's gotta be good at copyrighting, or social media, or they gotta be good at YouTube, or whatever that is, pick the next thing, and I'm gonna spend a day binging. And this is not something you're spending a month or a year binging, it's just going deep for one day so you get a step ahead of everybody else. Now this brings us to step number four, and this is where it starts getting to be really fun. For me, when I got started in business, I started looking around at what people were doing, I realized there were a lot of different steps, right? Traffic generation, copyrighting, funnel building, phone sales, live events, all that kind of stuff, but for me, the thing that was the most exciting was funnels. The next thing you start talking about, website, talking about getting traffic, and I was like, oh my gosh, I started seeing the concept, it was very similar to the direct mail. When I wanted to learn copyrighting, I remember there was a copyrighter studying who is a legend in the copyrighting space, his name's Gary Halber. He said, if you wanna become a really good copyrighter, what you need to do is go and find salesletters written by the greatest copyrighters of all time. He said, don't just read them and study them, he's like, literally get out a pad of paper and hand write it, like write the headline that they wrote, then write the intro copy and the lead and then the sub headlines and everything. He said, if you spend three or four hours actually physically handwriting out the sales letter, you're gonna know it at a deeper level, understanding why they use every single word because you've had to physically write out every single one. It's not just reading a book and dabbling, it's going deep and really try to understand that people who are the best in the world, what do they do and how do they do it differently? Guess who's here? Steve Larson, when he came into my world and he wanted to become a funnel builder and he wanted to learn how to speak from stage and he was working for me, he told me at night he would take the presentations, he'd see me on a stage like this, talking and speaking, he would literally take my presentations, he'd go home at night and he would watch them and he would stand up, he would practice himself speaking in front of a mirror. So he could learn, like if I'm gonna captivate a stage and stand in front of a huge audience, like how do I do that in a way that's gonna be successful? He'd never done it before. And eventually he took that and was able to create his own version of it, but it gave him the ability to look at what someone was doing, successfully modeling it so you can understand it at a deeper level. This is how you master skill set. Okay, let's put our hands together for Steve Larson. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! So for you what I want you to identify, of all the things that make somebody successful in that business, what's the thing that you're most passionate about? The thing that you wanna go deep on? The thing that, man, if you can wake up every day just thinking about it and reading about it and talking about it and like trying to master it would fire you up more than anything. Yeah, I'm gonna get nerdy, is that all right? Yeah! That is all right, because nerds get paid. Alrighty. I remember when I was gonna launch my coaching business and I was like, I wanna teach people how to start businesses online. I built my own businesses, but I never coached somebody through it. I found my dream customer. For me it was a guy named Drew Canole. He launched a company called FitLife TV and I came to Drew and I was like, hey, I've launched a supplement company. I know you're thinking about launching a supplement company. I would love to show you exactly how to do this. And so I flew out on my own dime, went out to his office as I sat there with his team, mapped out the funnel for their new supplement funnel, helped them build it, helped them launch it. And from that, they became very successful and I was able to take that story and leverage it to get other clients as well. We were blown away with the results that we received. You know, we weren't expecting it to be this big. A couple other really good examples. Todd Dickerson, who's my co-founder in ClickFunnels. When I first met Todd, he started working for me and he literally worked for me for free for over a year. He didn't charge me once. He was serving, he was helping, he was doing things. And eventually I was like, man, this guy is so helpful. Like if I'm not careful, I'm gonna lose him. And I actually went to him and I was like, hey, can I pay you something? He's like, sure, whatever you think's fair. And then over time, I was like, he's so valuable. I gotta give him some more money. So I gave him some more money. And eventually, when we had the idea for ClickFunnels, I assumed that Todd was gonna be my employee working on the business and he came back. So I don't wanna do this as an employee. I wanna do it as your partner. And because he'd given me so much value for so many years, for so long, the only logical thing for me to say was yes. Todd became my business partner. He now owns half of ClickFunnels and we built a huge empire together. It all started with him coming and literally working for free. So you can leverage that skill set to partner with your dream people. And if that doesn't work and maybe you're not able to partner with him for whatever reason, now you've got this skill set that's so great. And now you can go out there and build a company around your skill set. Okay, a lot of people look at me and said, Russell, you're really good at building funnels. Like you're not gonna be the CEO of a company, you're a funnel builder. I was like, yeah, but I think I'm the best funnel builder at Central Live. So I started a company where I was the best funnel builder and then I hired all the other people around me. And from there, we were able to build an empire. One year on $ilda. How about insurance corporation? Evolution is good The only of the new to start and grow your own businesses as well. And it'll give you the ability to through your 30s and your 40s and beyond to have the empire that you dreamed of. But right now in the 20s, focus 100% on mastering one skill set and becoming the best in the world at the thing that you love to do.
