May or may not have some brass balls here in the office. This is always crazy in the office. There's a box. Woo! The box is excited. You guys ready for this? This is the first proof of... No way! Woo! Woo! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Todd's in the office. It's his birthday. Did we sing happy birthday to Todd yet? Not yet have I got a CAKE? You haven't got a cake. We need a cake! Someone got a cake for Todd and then we'll sing happy birthday. implemented Happy birthday! Now, I'm at a secret meeting right over there. Melanie's here. Doctor Chad Wollner, he's doing an event tonight. For chiropractors... I'm coming to teach them how to decomoditize their business. Excited for smellin' me? I'm super excited for this. Here we go. I want people to know as incredible of an entrepreneur as this guy is, he is that much, if not more, of an incredible friend. He's just such an incredible community. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. We wanted to practice hooks in the office, and so we had everybody here on the team write a couple hooks to sell the Doc-Com Secrets book. So I'm putting up all the ads of everybody, and so far, like $5 have been spent on everyone's thinkers. We just put it up today. Anyway, Nick is crushing it right now. What? Nick has so far two sales. Are you kidding? To everybody's zero sales. Are you sending those to us at the affiliate link? Yeah, my affiliate. Congrats. That's awesome, dude. Nick's going from funnels to traffic. Watch out. So we've got Nick and Josh tied up four sales, but Josh is winning it. $7.20 a sale, and Nick's at $7.63 a sale. Ooh, real close. All the exact same audiences, exact same images, exact same headline, all they adjusted was the hook on the top, the social hook. Ooh. Brandon's been making me film videos all day today. It's a new funnel builder secret. The last video, this is the last outline. You excited? Heck yeah. It's always a good day when we're filming videos. You guys want to see behind the scenes, I'll set up. ["The Overhead Camera"] So basically, we've got a three-camera shoot. We've got two cameras at the back, one's wide, and one is a tight. And then we've got the overhead camera, which is really cool. And that's, I think, what differentiates your stuff from everyone else's right now doing training videos. You have the overhead camera and what's the overhead light for? So the overhead light actually separates Russell because if you can see, we're shooting on a black background and Russell kind of has dark hair. And so if without that light, he would kind of fall away, I guess. So this actually separates him from the background. That's very cool. And what's this light back here for? OK, so these two lights actually, these are the side lights. And these will actually light up the whiteboard. The idea is to have it evenly lit. So that's why we have two. They're both at the same height. So I'll write stuff right here. And you see this is what's going to show up on the camera, right there. Ooh, yeah. And then we've got what I absolutely love is the Kino Flow Celeb 200. That is an expensive light only for Russell Brunson, who is a celebrity, as you all know. The Celeb. So this one lights this direction. This one lights this direction to give it all the glare. Correct. And then this one is what creates a nice glint in the eye, which I absolutely love. And if you don't know, pay attention to anything of Russell's videos. He always has a glint in his eye because if he doesn't, then I haven't done my job. Then somebody else record that video. Yeah, that's right. And then there's the camera up top and the light up top to make my hair glow, my hair glow. Just love, just so good. So that's what's happening right now. We're jumping back into the training. So there you go, Fun and Billers Secrets, version 2.0 is coming soon. Do a fun near you. Developers in town today. And most of you guys have never heard the story of exactly how Click Fools came about. So Russell and Todd are on stage in our bedroom, telling the story and everything that's been going on. So check this out. Music Way, way depressed Friday afternoon. I don't know what's going to happen here. These guys are just hanging their heads. There's a lot of good way to end the week. John, what has happened here? It's all switching up now. OK, Kevin jumped to the lead in the whole contest. What place was Kevin at? He was third. This morning he was third. Question is, when does the contest actually end? 50 sales. When accounts reach 50 sales, we'll stop them. And then we're just going to see who has the best CPA. So Kevin's in the lead at $14.78. Nick is behind him by 50 cents. Josh is behind him by 2 bucks. How many sales? They all have six. They're all tied for six. All for six. But it's all about CPA in the end, because everyone's going to reach 50 sales. Music Wow, a whole lot of the smell is just amazing right now. And this is the man who's responsible for the smell. Literally, no one can get any work down because of how amazing it smells. I guess the male lady came and she wondered where it was coming from. I guess it's clear down the street now. Look at this thing. You are so sad that you're not here right now. It cuts a tri-temp. Miles mixed up our seasoning today. His dad provided our big cooker and some good fruit wood. A little bit of smoke in there and some charcoal. See that nice black crisp? And then this is linguiça. So what is linguiça from those people who aren't familiar with it? It is a Portuguese sausage. It's the appetizer. So while this finish is cooking, this will cook up real fast. It's already cooked. Cook it up, slice it up, throw in a tortilla, a little salsa, a little avocado. Look at this. Music I'm waiting for John. John's got the magic numbers about ready to come out here, telling people exactly where the bullpen sit. OK. All right. All right. You ready for this? No. Oh, man. Well, you should. Some ads that have been turned off. So why would you turn something off? Because the ADA didn't perform when we came to the show. This is one of those scenarios where Stephen Larson used to tell a story. He'd go in, he'd build a phone over somebody, and they'd say, oh my gosh, this is awesome. And then the next day, he'd turn it off, turn it off. Almost bankrupt him. And there's so many cells coming through. The exact same thing happened with me, with my hook. So mine was turned off because it was doing too well. John is up? Seven? Well, the almost bankruptest part's true, which is like any sales. So. Ha ha ha ha ha. All right, JP, what do we got? Josh is in first place. What? Pulling ahead, even more of Nick. What? Buy a dollar and. What? No, 98 cents. No. So crap. 98 cents. But it's Nick. And second place is Nick. Next place comes in, Karen. Hold up the third one. Oh no. Kevin comes in fourth place. What? Ha ha ha ha. Jake is in fifth place. And this two comic club stuff is getting insane. So as you can see here, this wall, all filled up. They have to like move light switches and thermostats, anything else. It's even behind the door here. It's over the top of the door. It's coming down the side. We're running out of wall space because on the other walls, we have our eight figure award, the Big X. $10 million. Dude, the light, you can't see it very well. I'll show you on this side here. Basically, we've got six of them there. We've got 12. So basically that's 18, 19. We actually have four more. And they're filling in this. We're probably going to have to move this painting. I don't know what we're going to do. We have more awards than we have wall space right now. So we're actually going to be actually out here, this dirt, where we're buying this lot right back here to build another building just so that we can have wall space. We need a building as well. But we need more wall space. Oh, what's in the box? You guys ready for this? This is the first proof of the Fattest Book. No way! Dude, that is killer legit. This is the upsell offer we're about to sell the crap out of. So straight to something first to film really quick. So the actual book is this Fatt, not this Fatt. Oh my god. This is crazy. Anyway. Can you say value? So here's half of the book that we're selling in the upsell. Mayor may not have some brass balls here in the office. What are these? All right, so they're asking what's the story behind it. So I'm going to tell you my side of the story, and David's telling his side of the story, because this is a good story. So Dan Kennedy has a course called the brass balls factor. It's a copywriting course teaching you that if you want to be a really expensive, high-paid copywriter, the big secret is you have to be able to quote your prices with a straight face. And then he was telling a story about how the first time he quoted a guy like $50,000 for a sales letter, the guy was like, whoa. He's like, where's your wheelbarrow? And he goes, what do you mean? The wheelbarrow used to win those brass balls. He's like, how did you quote me $50,000 for a letter? Anyway, it's the whole course called brass ball factor and how to actually charge what you're worth. So that was kind of a funny thing. Then fast forward a couple years later, after the list in that course, we had our sales floor and we were selling everything for like $2,500 bucks. Try to get the sales guys to sell it for five grand or 10 grand, but they're all scared of it because they're like, oh, it's only worth $2,500. I'm like, no, dude, it's worth way more. So we bought these initially, and we had the brass balls award for whoever could pitch and close the highest deal of the week. Got the brass balls on their desk for the entire week. And it was so scary. And finally, one guy sold it for five grand and he's like, oh, and he got the brass balls and everyone else wants it. And they start selling five grand and then they start going to six and then seven. And then it became the award that got put on the desk if we ever pitched the highest deal. Then fast forward to the affiliate challenge. But I was so excited. I was one of my very first, I just met Russell. I was so excited to find a way of actually selling his products. I thought if I could sell his products, maybe he would become my friend. No, no, no, no. That's the secret, by the way. To sell my products will be, I'm just kidding. It's the worry, it always works that way. And so I tried as hard as I could and I built a list and I thought, you know what? All the prizes out there, the one I want is this, the brass balls because I have four boys. And with four boys in the house, there's a ton of testosterone going on. And I thought, this would be one of the best lessons I could ever teach my kids. And I remember Dan Kennedy's story, because when I followed Dan, I thought, I want my kids to grow up with this ability to be able to ask for anything and get it. And so I thought that would be like the best token. So I did everything I could and I forget how many I sold. I got it and I was so excited. So they sat up on my shelf and my kids were like, what is that? And so they were, brass balls became the big thing in the Woodward household. Many times, anyone did something really cool. It's like, dude, you got brass balls. The old set is very war. Oh, those aren't brass anymore. These aren't brass because these actually got thrown in our pool because they're boys. So they, they were throwing them at each other. They became shop puts. These were very well used. And so I was sitting there thinking, we have this amazing contest coming up. I thought, well, it'd be something really super cool. So I was listening to Dan and Derek's course. He reminded me, you have to have something for every tier. And I thought, we need to have a tier where people get the brass balls. So I asked Miles to order. See if they still made them. And that's, they still got them. Okay, now the other back stories. When we did that launch, it was for the top 10 affiliates got brass balls. And one of the top 10 was Jennifer Ledbetter. So I messaged her, I was like, hey, just, you know, we'll get you anything that you don't have to have brass balls. And the funny thing is, you know, we're actually like, no, like, dude, I want the brass balls. She's like, this is a big deal. Like I wanted to be one of the men and win the brass balls. And I was like, okay. So we set her brass balls too. So there you go. Brass balls work.
