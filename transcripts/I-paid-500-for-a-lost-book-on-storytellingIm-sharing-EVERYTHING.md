## Transcript
George Lucas gets his book and he reads it and he's like, oh my gosh, if this is true and every single story of all time follows this, it's been successful. I'm going to make a movie based on that. And he creates the very first version of Star Wars. Hey, this is Russell. Welcome back to my vault. Today, I've got an insanely cool book, one of the greatest books of all time that you probably never heard of, but it's definitely influenced you both in your personal life and probably your business life as well. It's called The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell. And this not only is a copy of the book. This is a copy of the first edition of Hero with a Thousand Faces. And so if you've ever heard of the story of the hero's journey, it all started with this man right here, Mr. Joseph Campbell. This first edition copy I paid $500 for and this book has got so many cool stories that I cannot wait to share with you today. The first time I heard about Hero with a Thousand Faces, I was at a marketing seminar. I believe it was Perry Belcher on stage. He was talking about storytelling and things like that. And he referenced it like, hey, there's this book by Joseph Campbell. We'll call The Hero with a Thousand Faces. And so I know much about other than that. But whenever anyone recommends a book, especially someone I respect like Perry, I on Amazon buy it. So about a copy of the first edition that came to me. And I didn't read it for a while. And then later I started hearing more and more stories about it as I got deeper into understanding storytelling and story selling. I kept coming up over and over and over again for me. So I started doing some research. And the first thing I found out about this book that was super fascinating was there was a guy you may have heard of him before, but he got a copy of this book and he started reading it. And that guy's name was George Lucas. And George read this entire book and he realized that the framework that Joseph Campbell talks about in here is the framework to tell stories. What Joseph Campbell did in his studies, he went back in time, he went back through every generation time, all the way back to like basically Adam. And then also everywhere, like around the world, different cultures. And he started looking out how all these people told their myths, their stories, their legends. And we realized when we started looking from from culture to culture, area to area, time period to time period, every single person told their story in almost the exact same way. They all follow this, the sequence of events that he called the hero's journey. Now Campbell's version of it, there's 17 steps. I'm not going to go through all 17 steps, but the basic gist of it is the hero starts in an ordinary world, right? Then the hero hears the call to adventure. And then right after he hears the call to adventure, he has a refusal to call. Like, no, I don't want to do that. But then he decides to go on the journey anyway. So he leaves his ordinary world and he goes on this journey. As he goes on the journey, he meets this guide and the guy takes him and goes to this whole journey, right? And if you look at almost any movie, even nowadays, they follow this, this process, they follow this path. I always think about like, if you read Lord of the Rings or watch it, like J.R. Tolkien literally follow this process, right? Frodo Baggins starts the journey in the shire, in the ordinary world, right? And also he hears this called adventure. Bilbo comes and brings in the ring and like, you need to take this ring to Mordor and destroy it. It's called adventure. And then Frodo's like, no, not me. I'm a little halfling. I'm not even a real person. Like, you know, refuses the call. But then they talk him into each side to go do it. And as soon as he does, then who shows up? Gandalf the Grey, the guide shows up and takes him on this journey. And like, and like the entire Lord of the Rings follows the hero's journey to a T, right? And it happens in movie after movie. And so that's why the Hero Thousand Faces is so fascinating, because it's the framework of how we understand stories. And honestly, if you think about it, it's each of our framework. I think the reason why we as humans resonate with it so much subconsciously, even we don't know it, right? Even if you watch all these movies, you know, I did that. Every movie follows basically the same storyline. We still relate to it because it's our story, right? It's our story of growth and change. Like you think about this, like for most of us, like we start, like we, we are in our ordinary world and somewhere along the line, you decide you want to step up. You want to start a business. You want to be an entrepreneur. You want to be an athlete. You wanted to, you wanted to leave your ordinary world to become something different, right? And then if you left that world, it's probably scary for you. Refuse the call and eventually decided to go forward anyway. And then you met a guide along the way and the guy took you on a journey, right? And throughout the journey, you had trials and you had ups and downs. The hero's journey is our story, which is what I think we resonate at such a deep subconscious level. And so for me, when I first read this book, I started understanding, I started thinking, how could I use this when I'm speaking to my audience? Right? How could I weave this into my presentations? At the time we were launching ClickFunnels. Um, I was trying to write webinars for it. I started thinking instead of me just like telling random stories, what if I took this story framework and story structure and started like actually telling my stories differently, not just me telling the stories where I thought I had actually following that process of me following the hero's journey and sharing it. If it's the same story framework that's persuaded people from thousands of years in every culture of all time, would it be the same framework? I would need to tell stories to move my audience and move my people. I look at this now a decade later as I weave this into most everything I've done from webinars to live events, to challenges. Uh, the hero's journey framework I use over and over and over again. In fact, if you read the expert secrets book, I literally teach everybody the hero's journey framework and how I weaved it into my presentations. And so it's fascinating is did this work? Yes. Right. I look on the back end of 10 years of applying this to my business specific. I run a software company for crying out loud like, like people like, Oh yeah, this works in movies. I understand. Oh yeah, it works for story books. I understand. It's like, I run a software company. Right. And I heard the story of this and I decided to use the framework and what did it do? Right. In the last, the first 10 years of Clickforms, we sold over a billion dollars of our products. We built the community, we built the tribe of funnel hackers. Right. We changed people's lives from all around the world. And how did we do it? It's by we layered our message onto the framework found here inside of the hero with a thousand faces. That's why this book is so important to me and should be so important to you. Again, this is something that's influenced you in ways you don't even know. Every book you've read, every movie you've experienced, every webinar for me or any of my students you've gone through, all followed this framework in this journey. And so by learning it and understanding it and mastering it is the fastest way to persuade and influence and change the lives of the people you even call the serve. Okay. Now Joseph Campbell's version of the hero with a thousand faces, his hero's journey is 17 steps. And honestly, it's, it's probably more complex than what we need for our world. Like in expert secrets, I broke it down to like, to closer to 10 to 14 steps. But what's interesting is that Joseph Campbell, after he wrote this book, later Christopher Vogler, who's one of the big Disney executives, he read this book and then he changed it and built a framework that's like 13 or 14 steps. It's much simpler. And if you look at this, this is literally the framework that they use in every single Disney movie. So if you watch Cars, Moana, Brave, Frozen, literally any Disney movie of all time, it follows Christopher Vogler's framework, which is adapted and based off of the hero with a thousand faces. I'm going to walk you through what the, what this framework looks like. Okay. So I'm going to draw it like this is a big circle. There are two sides of this over here is the normal world or the ordinary world. And over here is the unknown. Okay. So it starts up here with the hero living in the ordinary world. And then the hero hears a call to adventure. Okay. So you think about this with any, any movie, right? Lightning McQueen is the hero of that story. Right. And he's racing with the piston cup. He loses it or it's a tie. And so he's got to go and drive to California to go and do this race. Right. So he's called adventure. I get to leave and go to California. He'll have a chance to win the piston cup. Right. Here's the called adventure. Rocky Balboa sitting there. He's a boxer. He's not that successful. And then all of a sudden, Apollo Creed calls him up because he happens to be the Italian stallion and he gets an opportunity to like, to come fight. Right. And so Apollo Creed calls him, brings him in like, you need to fight. You have a chance to fight the, the, the champion. Right. He hears the call to adventure. Okay. So that's the first step. And then usually after the call to venture, what happens is the refusal to call, they freak out. Uh, Rocky Balboa was like, I'm just some bum on the street. I'm not going to fight the, the greatest fighter of all time. Right. They get scared. They don't want to, but eventually they decided to go through it after they hear the call to venture, the refusal to call. Then they come to the next phase, which is the meeting of the mentor. Okay. So Rocky decides to say, yes, the fight. Who shows up? Boom. Mix shows up and says, all right, I'm going to train you to be able to beat Apollo creator to be able to fight in cars. Doc shows up and teaches the end. It becomes his mentor to help teach him how to be a race car. Right. After they meet the mentors where they cross the threshold. This is where Frodo leaves the shire. This is where the queen gets in the car and starts driving. Like they, they cross the threshold here and now they're officially on the journey. During next phase is called, uh, trials and failures. Okay. This is where they're learning lessons. They're growing. They're becoming something different. Right. They go through different trials and failures. They go through growth, new skills. Uh, from there, they get to a spot and a phase that's called death and rebirth. Okay. On the journey, the hero has to go through something where they have their, their essence there, the person who they are before they leave on this journey. And for the hero to transform, become what they want, the old character has to die and it'd be reborn into a new character. Right. And so it's fascinating. Cause you look at, if you look at, uh, spirituality, Christianity, for example, like this is part of our journey. If you're a Christian, right? It's like you go on this journey and then there's a time where you have to go through death and burial and resurrection, which is baptism. Right. But every single, every single hero goes to that, the death of their old identity and the rebirth of who they are, the new person that's coming. Okay. From there, they have a revelation. Like, oh my gosh, this is the idea of an epiphany. Like I call them epiphany bridge and expert seekers. They have a revelation and idea of like, this is how I'm going to succeed. Um, then they keep moving through and they go to the next section, which is where they have, um, they finally start getting the changes they're looking for. Boom. Then after that, then they go through the section called the atonement against the Christians. That sounds very familiar, but for most of this is where they make right. The thing that is wrong. Right. They go through that. They have this thing, the atonement. Um, after that, they get the gift. Okay. Uh, inside of a hero thousand faces, he calls us that the hero returns back to the ordinary world with the elixirs. They figured out the solution. This is the promise. How we solve the problem and then bring the gift and bring the elixir back and then the person returns back to the ordinary world changed. And then this is the end of the story. So that is the process. So again, you can plug in almost any movie, any story into this framework and you see it happening over and over and over again. I remember the first time I learned this after I started watching movies and they would almost be frustrating to me and I'm like, Oh, there's the hero. There's your in your world. Oh, there's the guide to showed up. Oh, here's the first set of trials and errors. Oh, here's where the death is. Here's the rebirth. Here's the, the, the moment of no return, right? Here's that the revelation. Here's the spot where they, you know, they, they made up for the thing they did wrong. Here's the, I got the gift of the, you know, they got the elixir. Now they're returning back home with it. And so you start seeing this pattern happening over and over and over again. We change the characters or change the circumstances or change situations. And it's built literally millions of TV shows, movies, stories, books. Um, and again, I think it's the pattern of your life. All right. If you guys want, um, I made some show notes, uh, putting us in notes. Uh, we're literally, you can get the entire framework, the 17 steps that Joseph Campbell uses in his version of the hero's journey. Also, he has a copy of Christopher Vogler's version and I'll also give you a copy of my version from expert secrets. You can see three different variations and versions of the hero's journey. They all follow the same process, the same path. One is used for, uh, you know, all stories, uh, myths, things like that. This is used very specifically for Hollywood and movies and mines very much for how funnel hackers, markers, business owners, they can use inside their presentations, their video sales letters. Anytime they're speaking, uh, all three is to help you to see how to apply the hero's journey into your life, into your business, into all the things you're doing. So if you want that in description, we'll have a link over to those notes. Other than that, thank you guys so much. I hope you enjoyed this video.
