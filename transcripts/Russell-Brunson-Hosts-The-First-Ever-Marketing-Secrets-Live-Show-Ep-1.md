## Transcript
What's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson. Welcome to the marketing secrets live show. This is the first time we've done this live, live, live. And I'm so excited. We've got a bunch of cool things we're talking about, a lot of fun segments we're going to do with you guys today. But to kind of kick this whole party off, I wanted to go to a question that I've gotten from you guys as a community. We asked last week in the Facebook group and said, hey, if you guys have questions for Russell, please post them down below. We've got a whole bunch of amazing questions back. And I wanted to pick one to answer because I thought it was a fun one. I thought it'd be timely and good for everybody here. So the questions from the community that came through that I want to answer says, now that you run a company worth nearly a billion dollars, remember to say billion, you have to do this thing with your pinky from Austin Powers. I was a 90s kid. So now that it comes to worth nearly a billion dollars, do you have to make a concentrated effort every day to remain humble or do the new challenges you face keep you humble? So I think that question was really, really cool. I wanted to address that one because I've been in this industry now for over 15 years and in that window of time, I've seen a lot of people who have come and made a whole bunch of money and then people who've crashed. I've seen people who have gotten really big egos, people, you know, and all sorts of stuff. And I'm not going to, I've gone through a cycle as well myself. I think there's times when you drink your own Kool-Aid and you think you're amazing. And I wanted to address that because it's something that I'm actively always trying to work on. And I think that's one of the issues as well. But before I go deep into answering that question, this is a sign that Todd Dickerson sent me. This is a Christmas, I think it was Christmas or birthday or some kind of present. He sent me, Todd's my co-founder in ClickFunnels. He's the genius who actually coded ClickFunnels, the very first version of it. And this is a quote that if you guys have seen the social network, it's one of the best lines with Justin Timberlake's character. He goes and meets Mark Zuckerberg and they're talking about, yeah, we're going to make millions of bucks. And he goes, no, no, no, no, he's like, he's like a million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool? A billion. And then like the whole thing seems stopped. And it's like, oh, and so when we launched ClickFunnels, initially it was like, we want to make a million dollar company. And then there was a point where like a million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool is a billion. And so Todd sent me this as a gift and it's been hanging on my wall ever since then. Every day I come in, I look at that. I say, okay, that's the goal. That's the vision. That's what we're trying to create something that we had created so much value in the marketplace or worth a billion dollars. And ClickFunnels is not there yet. I'm working my tail off every single day to get there. But this is a constant reminder for me. So what I actually wanted to do is I wanted to give one of these away. I got this one from Todd and I want to give one for me to one of our faithful subscribers and viewers to actually have this so you can put on your wall as well. So if you want this amazing canvas prints, it's a million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool is a billion dollars. There's only one way to win this right now. And what you got to do, I'll tell you how to win it. You got to get your phone out. And on your phone, there's an app. The app is called podcast by Apple. It's the Apple podcast app. You search for the marketing secrets show. That's this podcast. It's my podcast. You search for it and then you go and you subscribe. That way after you subscribe every single day on the phone when we do new marketing secrets episodes, they'll go on your phone. You can leave comments. You can rate. You can review all those amazing things. But the way you can actually win this sign is you have to go right out to the podcast app. Go subscribe. So find, search marketing secrets. Go subscribe. Click on the subscribe button. So you subscribe then come back to where we're at right now. Go in the comments and say I subscribe. As soon as I know you subscribe, we're going to put all the names into a drawing in the next day or so. And then someone from my team will randomize it and they will pick one random person who subscribed the podcast this week. And we will ship you out this sign to put on your wall so you can have the same concert reminder I've had on my wall for the last two and a half, three years as I've been trying to build a billion dollars worth of value in the world. So there is the gift and the bribe for you guys to go subscribe to the show. If you haven't yet, just go to marketing secrets inside the podcast app and subscribe. And then come back and in the comments down below say I'm subscribed. If you're like, I don't know if I subscribed it or not. Now is a good time to go figure out if you are. Go to the podcast app and subscribe. Okay. So that's that. I want to talk about this question. So I kind of reframe this question into something like how I would kind of rephrase it somebody. So the question was like, well, how do you remain humble? And then I wrote my subheadliner. I wrote, aka don't drink your own Kool-Aid. And I think one of the biggest problems and I remember this vividly like 15 years ago when I got started, like I spent the first two years in my basement, like writing the thing out and it was lonely and everyone thought I was crazy and people made fun of me and like all those things, right? And the sooner I started this success, I think part of you gets this, especially as an entrepreneur, especially as like an athlete for me. It's like you get this like, like when you start having the success, it's just like you want to kind of like prove to them that they're wrong, right? And so I think my head started getting bigger. I thought like I was, I thought, I don't know, I was drinking my own Kool-Aid. I was reading my own bio and luckily for me a couple of years later, multiple times now, my company's crashed and burned and as painful as that process was, it helped me understand some things. So I wrote down basically five things to help you remain humble that I would say are the five things that go through my head all the time as I'm trying to make sure that I'm very careful on this path. I feel like, you know, for any of us, if we're not careful, if our heads get too big, if we stop being humble, like all these things that we're trying to do can be taken away from us. I very much believe that to be true. Just because of my cycle of every time that my head gets too big, I seem to get humbled. And so these are the five points I had. So number one, I want everyone to understand is that when you take on something like this, that you are called to serve an audience, right? It's not about you making money. Like that's how we keep scores. Like how much money my business makes. I hit two comic club, I'm at two comic club X. Like we're always looking at those benchmarks to have something that we can track our results on. But that's not why we're in this game. Like we are called to serve somebody, right? Like any of you entrepreneurs who are here today, you've had that calling, you're like, oh my gosh, like I'm here to serve this type of person or this person or this was me five years ago. I figured out how to solve this problem. I'm here. I'm called to serve that audience, right? So the first thing I understand is that you're not here as like, look how great I am. It's literally for me, I believe that entrepreneurship is a calling and it's calling that you've been called to serve this group of people. And when you think about it that way, it's different. It's not about you. It shifts the focus from like, look how great I am to like, how can I help these people and how can I put them up on a pedestal? Okay. If you look at a special of last three or four years, you know, the marketing that we do, if you notice like it's less and less ever about like, look how great Russell is because first off, that's annoying. And second off, nobody cares. Instead, I want to take the people that are having success in our community, I put them up on a pedestal. I've been called to serve them. I've not been called to serve myself, right? So that's the first thing I understand is that you have been called to serve. Number two, you have to realize that it is not you. Okay. I think sometimes we get this great idea. We're like, I'm a genius. And it's like that, that may be like, I don't know. I don't personally believe that. I don't think like we just, I don't think that the idea is us. The idea comes to us, right? Like we're blessed with these ideas. We're blessed with inspiration. We're blessed with like, like seeing the vision of where we need to go. And those things are, they're not us. They're given to us. And so you have to realize that that it's not, it's not you. So it's not you making this greatness. It's you because you're, you're following a path and you're doing the right things that you are given these insights, these ideas, these things. And so it's not you. And so the more you think that, oh, this is me, the less those, those ideas, those inspirations will come to you. So it's a very fine line. When your head starts getting big, those things will, will become less and then things start shrinking for you. And the more you realize that it's not you, that you're just there receiving these ideas, receiving inspiration, then it gives you the ability to be able to continue to get those things. That's number two. Number one, you're called to serve. Number two, realize that it is not you. Number three, all of the stuff that you are creating can be taken away at any second. I can literally wake up tonight and get a text from somebody and be like, Hey, Russell, ClickFunnels is gone. And then you may think, no way, Russell, you're too big. It's like, no, I see that happen all the time. Different companies. It'd be a government agency comes to shut you down. It could be your servers crash. There could be a million things that could happen. Some of you guys remember a ClickFunnels story. Like we were about a year, year and a half into ClickFunnels and I was flying to London to go speak at this event. And when I landed the plane, I got off and initially I didn't have internet because I had to like get a international chip in my phone. I plugged one in. Soon as I did, my phone's blowing up and ClickFunnels servers were down. We were down for like seven or eight hours. We were like on the brink of losing ClickFunnels. The whole entire thing. Four years ago, like when we first started this whole journey, we almost lost the entire thing. We would have lost the company because of a database issue that happened. Now, since then we've gone insane and hired insane amounts of people and infrastructure stuff to make sure that stuff doesn't happen again. But it could happen for any of us, right? Any of our businesses, we can lose it. And so it's understanding like this can be taken away at any given time. And it could be a million different things. I've had close friends in the last couple of months that have passed away from health issues that was taken away from there's government interactions. There's the million different things. And so if you think it's all you, I think a lot of times that's when we get humbled. I've had multiple times my company has crashed and I realize, you know, prior to that, I think, oh, I'm a genius. Look how great it is. And when it's taken away, it's like, wow, it really wasn't me. There's so many other things that we need to be grateful for that are happening that keep us, they keep this moving. So that's number three, it can be taken away. Number four is that none of this stuff really matters. What all said and done, like it doesn't matter as much fun as entrepreneurship is. Business is always kind of things like it doesn't really matter. Last time I was with my kids, they had a wrestling match. I remember going there and watching it and both my kids did awesome. They both won their matches. Dallin had, he was wrestling the kid who was the district champ last year. Dallin out there and won. We're going crazy. We're screaming. And I was like, I was sitting there. I'm like, this is what matters. Like me, sometimes my kids, my family, that's what matters. It's not this, you know, I have an Instagram, I think two or three times over the last month, I've made posts where I'm just like, like, business is what you do while you're waiting for your kids to get out of school. Business is what you do while you're waiting for your wife to come home. Like, like this is kind of the thing to keep us occupied, have some fun, hopefully serve some people. But like when it all comes down to the thing that really matters is our families. And so I think when you realize that, that none of this stuff really matters that much, it gives you a different perspective. And the number five, and this is one that's really hard is don't pay attention to the fans. Um, I think sometimes as you start growing, people are like, start talking how great you are and you'd be very, very careful. That's like, uh, uh, what are the, the mermaids, the sirens, like the sirens who are in the water and they're singing this beautiful music, right? And you get closer and closer and then they come in and they eat you and they destroy you. Um, uh, we were, anyway, that's the long story. I just tell my kids about that and we were in the swimming pool and I was like scaring them and it was really funny, but that's another story from the day. Um, you have to be careful. Like, like the, the fans, the people who you're serving will look at you as if you're something great, something special and they will tell you that over and over and over again. As much as I love hearing it, I have to like listen to it and I have to like, I have to like put it on the shelf. You can't, um, if you, if you do that, you keep, if you keep listening to what the fans are saying, um, it becomes very, very hard. And, um, it's funny. I'm Sean Stevenson, who's a close friend and passed away a little while ago. I remember we were joking one time we were hanging out and we were joking about our wives and we're like, we love our wives. And he said, one of the, the, the things about our wives is like, our wives aren't fans. He's like, they, they fell in love with us and they love us, but they're not our fans. It says, it's nice cause you come home and you feel like you're all awesome. Then there's your, your wife who loves you, but she's not a fan and she's just like, Hey, and it, it changed. Like it instantly changes this whole thing. And I'm so grateful for, for a wife who's not a super fan, who's, who's realistic. Who's just like, this is what it is. And so, um, I think that it's important for all of us to have people in our lives around us who aren't fans, who are like the people who love us, uh, because it helps take the ego off and let you focus on what's actually important. So how do we make humble? Those are the five things. Um, number one, you are called to serve. Number two, realize that it is not you. A number three, it can be taken away. Number four, none of it really matters. Number five, do not pay attention to the fans. If you do that, as you are growing and you are serving and you are changing people's lives, it'll help you to focus on, um, on that and not, not get, uh, ahead that's too big. All right. Hope that helps. Um, again, the giveaway, I'm going to kind of recap that again. This is the giveaway we are going to give you guys and all you got to do is so simple is just go subscribe to the podcast and somebody's going to win this. This is a science of the million dollars. This isn't cool. He knows cool as a billion dollars. All you got to do is go to your phone, uh, go download the podcasting app and then go subscribe to the marketing secret show.

Enter that and then come back, leave a comment down below and we'll take all the comments of everyone who said, I'm subscribed. And, uh, and then we will throw you guys into a huge drawing. So that is the game plan. Hopefully everyone's on that. Oh, cool. I can see everyone's questions and comments now. Um, all right. So that was the first segment of the show. What do you guys think so far? That's kind of fun. Um, all right. Very cool. Kenneth subscribe. Congratulations. Kenneth, you are in the, uh, thing. Glenn is subscribed. Whoa. All right. Cool. Well, we had an iPad so I can read comments. First of all, this is episode number one, as you can probably tell. So, um, all right. Well, they're figuring that out. Um, whoo, they're segment number one. All right. Let me desk up a little bit. Okay. We are going. Am I good to keep going? Okay. Hey everyone. All right. So we are back. Um, right now we're going to move to the next segment, uh, the show, which I'm really excited for. This is called tales of a funnel hacker. This is where I'm pulling out really cool, um, stories from the community. You sometimes are people who, um, who speak a funnel hiking live, or maybe they're in a minor circle, maybe I hung out with them at the restaurant. There's just a cool story that I want to share. And, uh, this one, um, is someone who, uh, doesn't know I'm sharing this yet. So I'm kind of excited. Um, but the other guys know I have my own inner circle coaching program. It's $50,000 a year. We had a hundred people in it. And this year I actually shut it down. Um, which if you listen to the marketing seekers, uh, podcast, you've heard that story before, um, which was a really hard and painful thing for me to shut down. But it was something that we needed to do to focus on, uh, on where we're going. But, um, uh, basically every single entrepreneur that group gets to come, they have 30 minutes on stage here in our office to present what they're doing their business and stuff like that. And I want to share with you guys a little clip from my friend, uh, Annie Grace. Uh, she is, um, yeah, one of my favorite people in our, in our inner circle. And, um, she, she shared something that had such a huge profound impact on me. I remember after she said, I sat there and I was like, Oh my gosh, I kept thinking about the next day I thought about it. The next day I had her, like, uh, there's another group that came in. I had to like retell it again. And I want to share with you guys cause it's such a big, uh, important thing. Um, for those who don't know Annie, Annie, uh, she's written a bunch of different books. Um, I can't tell you, I have another cool announcement about her. I can't announce yet, but, um, yeah, I can't yet. No, okay, I was going to trouble. Um, anyway, she's awesome, but I'm sure a book called the alcohol experiment, she has one called the naked mind and she helps people to break the chains of alcohol addiction. Um, and her books are amazing. Even if you're not addicted to alcohol, they can help you break the chains of any addiction. It helps you understand, um, the psychology behind it and NLP and all the, all the stuff that affects your brain, that gets you the causes and addiction. Um, and she is just an amazing person who's changing so many people's lives. And, um, and in her circles, she's talking about her business and she's trying to help all these people. And she's talking about, she's got a certification program coming in, all these things they're doing in, and you know, she's got, she's selling 1000, you know, 1000 copies of her books and she's on TV. And like all these things that are happening. And I think sometimes we're all excited, but then you see like, man, I'm selling all these things, not everybody's having success. And you get frustrated. And they're like, there's always that, that piece of it. And, uh, this insight she shared, um, has such a profound impact on me. I wanted to share with you. So I'm going to show this clip. It's about two minutes long. Uh, if you guys want to see it right now, this is from Annie Grace during her inner circle presentation this year. Really, I have been struggling a lot with this idea of a funnel since the very beginning on a personal perspective. So, you know, I've sold multiple hundreds of thousands of books and I'm like, Oh my gosh, of all those, you know, 250,000 books, how many people actually read it? Right. And then how many people do they finish it? And then how many people does it touch and how many people, and it gets so small to the point where like the people who need you and the people you're impacting feels so, so, so small. And so, um, Brian was like, well, it's kind of like the parable of the sewer. Like you, you sprinkle the seed and some of it falls on. It's just how the universe works. Some of it's going to get choked out. Some of it's going to, you know, spring up. Some of it's going to do these things. I was like, okay, it's just how the universe works. I just have to make peace with this idea. And, um, we just opened the stake at mine Institute where we've certified 60 coaches to go and kind of do this work in the world. And I was driving back from that training. I just dropped my team off at the airport. And I was really thinking about that. I was like, Oh my gosh, even in that room, you know, 60 people came, but like how many of them are actually going to create these businesses that do something and go somewhere in the world and it's just going to get smaller and smaller. And there's probably only going to be like five of them that are like the breakout people that impact other people. And then all of a sudden I just remembered the second part of that first. It was like, but the seeds that actually spring up will reproduce 30, 60, a hundred times. And so all of a sudden I saw that it's not a funnel. It's an hourglass. And I, I wanted to share that because that's what Russell's doing too. Right. Like it's, there's, you know, of all the people Russell touches, there's only a few, but then you look at the people in this room and we're the hourglass. You guys were the people who are like. And then the next thing I wanted to share, I think so good for me. And it's, it's something that like I remind myself of all the time as entrepreneurs, we are, as Alex Sharfin says, momentum based beings. We are forward focused. We want the next thing we are going to the next place. And a practice that like I, I do and, and something that just really speaks true to me is, is this quote. And I think if we can just say this to ourselves and have the tension of wanting the next thing, but also knowing that in this moment we have arrived, in this moment we are here, in this moment our destination is in each step and each moving forward is so powerful. And sometimes when you just get stressed and thinking about the next thing, just remember like we've already arrived. You guys were already here. This is the stuff. So I wanted to share those things. Isn't that an awesome message? I think that, you know, I've felt that sometimes before where it's just like, man, we're doing all these things. We're trying, we're spending so much money to put our voice out there, our message out there. And, and sometimes it is discouraging when you look at it like, oh, but like, you know, we sold, you know, I see people a lot of times in the Click Funds Facebook group like there's 250,000 people in there. Why is there only 100,000 members? What's wrong with everybody else? Or, you know, like we sold, I don't know, 300,000, 400,000 copies of the Dotcom Seekers and Expert Seekers books. And it's like, but why, like how, how's only 100,000 members? And then from those members, like how many are having success? And like, and you look at that and it can be, it can be frustrating sometimes. And then when she pointed that out and said, no, it's not a, it's not a funnel. It's an hourglass that the people who, who do take hold, those are the ones that grow. Like that's, that's what gives you the inspiration. That's really what I think for all of us, like our calling is to go out there and be as loud as we can, put our voice out there, put our products, our services, like putting it out there and, and try to change as many people's lives as possible. But the ones you do touch, the ripple effect from that, that's why we, that's why we do this. And so anyway, I hope that that helps any of you guys who are, who've been going through this process, who may be struggling or maybe maybe haven't figured out, like, like, you know, I think especially like if you guys take the disc profile, like I'm very high ROI, like is that my highest value? Like I need to see a return on investment or else I don't want to do it. For any of you guys who sometimes get frustrated, like I created this video, I posted it and they had like 13 people watched it or whatever. You know, and you're frustrated because it's like, you're not getting the traction you want yet. It's like, it's okay. Like you got to keep putting the message out there and keep putting it out there and keep putting it out there because you're sowing all these seeds, you're sowing all these seeds and the right people are going to find it. They're going to hear your message. They're going to take that thing and that's what's going to blossom. That's what's going to change the world. And so that's my, my message to you guys from Annie and I'm going to continue through marketing secret slide to try to find some of these cool experiences like that where there was 30 people in the room there with Annie that heard that, but it's like something I want to share with the entire world. I'm going to try to find some of those segments to share with you guys to really, to really give you the impact. So hope you guys enjoyed that. If you did post down the comments down below, say Annie, thank you so much for that, for the hourglass and all analogy. I think it's amazing. And, and that's it for the second segment of the marketing secrets live show. We need our drum. We need a band. We definitely live band right now. They want us to addition to be our live band.

Okay. Should we move to the next segment? All right. Here we go. All right, everybody. So the next segment of the show is called the ask Russell anything where you guys can literally ask me anything. And if you have any questions, how do they ask me? Oh, we'll let you know in the comments someday. Anyway, I've got two questions from the community that I think are really, really powerful that hopefully will be super helpful for you. So I'm going to actually play the video of the question and I'm going to respond to it on my phone. And the reason why, if you guys listened to my podcast episode a couple of weeks ago, we take these and we turn them into Instagram posts that are really, really cool. If you've been following me on Instagram, you've been seeing these where there's a video side by side with one person asking a question, one person answering. That's where created it now. So I've got two really cool questions from our community that I'm going to listen to with you guys and then we are going to answer live. So my first question today is from Dan lock. Dan is what we call an OG original gangsta back when I got started in his business 15 years ago. Dan was one of my very first people I knew when my first partners that we did project way back then. And now I look 15 years later how both of us evolve. I've become the sales funnel dude. He's become the closing dude. Now the copyright, like he's just an amazing marketer, super close friend. It was a major circle last year as well. And he submitted the question. So I'm really excited to actually hear from Dan his question. So here we go. Hey Russell, this is Dan lock out of the thousands and thousands of funnels that you've built and helped build. What do you think is the key difference between a funnel that generates seven figure in revenue versus an eight figure revenue? What's the, what are some of the key components? All right. Okay. So I'm going to answer this on my phone. What's up, Dan? Thank you so much for the question. And I think that's actually a really smart question. People rarely ask that they're usually like, what funnels going to work? And in your question, obviously someone who has gone to eight figures and beyond is looking like, what are the differences? And it's interesting. Um, the, the companies that are winning two comic club X awards like you and like the other ones, it's not so much that they have a super complicated funnel. It's not like, oh, they've got 500 different funnels. Most of them have like two or three funnels, but they, um, and they're not complicated. They're very simple. They're systemized and they, and they convert, right? They focus more on like, on, um, on selling on each page in the funnel. They focus more on like, coming better at telling the story, becoming better, doing the webinar. Like the focus is in the creative inside the pages of the funnel, not so much the funnel. So it's not like, oh, they had 45 steps and 13 episodes and 20 downs. So then 19 different follow up funnels and sequences. And when from here to here to here, like that's not what they're doing. They're like, I've got a funnel with four pages. It's a free plus shipping offer. And there's free plus shipping offer. There's my upsell, my downsell and my, and my other upsell. And then they focus insane on the conversion each page. Like how do I make this convert higher? What do I need to do on this page? We're near in this page. And they just focus on that. It's like a little tiny levers that swing huge doors, right? And they have a front end funnel and then they have like an upsell funnel. And most, most of the companies that are intent, um, like in two comic club X that have, they've gotten this huge award right here. Actually you want this one, Dan? I know you got one last year. Anyway, this is the two comic club X award. The X stands for $10 million. But most of the people who stay on the stage, again, it's, they have. Two or maybe three funnels and there's three funnels in the value ladder. Right. It's like a free plus shipping funnel to get people in. They have a webinar funnel, just they'll high ticket thing. And again, they obsess with the webinar. They do it live over and over and over and over and over again to make sure they're pitched the presentation they offer is perfect. And that's where the focus goes to. And then they have a high ticket thing on the backend, but like that's the, the focus is not a million different funnels. It's focusing on the creative inside of each funnel. It's focusing on the message that like that's, that's the difference between something's got, you know, an okay funnel to a seven figure funnel to, to be on. Cause they become really good at, at the copy, the creative, the selling, like that part of it is the most important part. So I hope that helps. Uh, and excited. Hopefully, Dan, to give you another one of these two comic X awards and next year's funnel, I can live in fact next fun like live, we're reduced in two comic clubs, see award because we had a bunch of people who were creeping up on $100 million inside of a funnel and, um, simple is the key. If you watch their funnels as well, they're all very, very simple. All right. Thanks man. Thanks for the question. Talk soon. Boom. There was the first question from Dan. All right. I'm going to go to question number two. Question number two is from a man, John Lee Dumas, JLD from entrepreneur fire podcasts. Um, John is probably one of the coolest guys in our industry. Super fun to work with, super relaxed. Um, just, uh, an all around cool guy and I had chance earlier this year to actually spend time and feed you with him. And his question actually ties back to, uh, when we were in Fiji with him and Tony Robbins and everything. So let me listen to his question and then, uh, and then we will give him an answer. Hey, what's up? John Lee Dumas here of entrepreneurs on fire in Russell. It was absolutely amazing getting to hang out with you in a Nmali Fiji Tony Robbins private resort for four days, uh, getting to mastermind with you, Dean Grassayosi, um, Lewis Howes, obviously Tony Robbins, Jenna Kutcher, so many amazing people, absolutely loved it. And my question for you is, what was your biggest takeaway over that four day mastermind that we were at from Tony Robbins, from Dean Grassayosi, from Jenna, from Lewis, from whoever it might have been. Um, what was your biggest takeaway from that mastermind? You can pass it along to myself and anybody watching this video. Take care brother and stay on fire. All right, here we go. What's up, JLD? First off, I had so much fun and Fiji with you hanging out and, uh, there were so many, so many cool conversations that happened from, you know, like in the actual mastermind, I mean, where Tony Robbins is sitting there, like looking at us all and like telling us what to do to like all the individual ones were hanging out at the spa or hanging out, just walking down the pass or like bowling or just all the fun things. Um, but I think of all the things that had the biggest impact on me at my, my stage right now in this, uh, in this business, this marketing game, uh, is when Tony looked at me and, um, he said, Russell, you are, uh, the operator of your business. I was like, yeah, that's what I do. I'm an entrepreneur. I'm an operator. I run this thing and he said the reason why that's all you're able to do is because you're an operator. Like your, your, your whole life is sucked in there. And Tony's like, I can't remember how many he's like, I own 54 companies, Russell. He's like, I'm the owner of all of them. I'm the operator of none of them. He's like, that's why I'm able to own 50 companies, have a billion dollar network. Like all these kinds of things that are crazy. He said, because I am, uh, I'm the owner, I'm not the operator. And he said, if you really want freedom, Russell, you have to transition from like, I'm the best operator in the world. I'm the CEO. I'm the like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's like, look, like there's a time and a place and a business for that where you got to be the CEO. It's got to push it to a certain spot. But he's like, there's also time you have to step away and become the owner of the company and get on the board of directors. And he said it for personal advice he gave me was like, step away from, from being the CEO, because like become, like go on the board of directors, be the owner of the company, not the operator, find the right people to become operators, put them underneath you. And, uh, and that was the biggest piece of advice for me. That was the most timely for me. Now, obviously it might not be the best piece of advice for everybody. There's, there's a point in your business when you're the entrepreneur and you're the one that's got to like push it up the mountain, do everything. There's a point when you have become the CEO, like there's, there's different seasons in life, but for me, that's definitely a season I'm in right now. It's like, how do I transition from being the operator of the business to the owner, where I take some of the pressure and stress off, focus on the vision and, uh, and be able to do that as opposed to being so deep in the weeds every single day where you're just doing the thing all the time. And so, uh, that was for me the biggest, uh, ha, that I've been sitting back now over the last, you know, month or two since I've been home trying to figure like, how do I actually execute on, how do I do that? I think for a lot of you guys who are listening to this, um, just start thinking about that as you're, as you're going through this, uh, this evolution of your business and you're not there yet knowing like that's where I'm going to be someday. I got to get prepared for that. I got to get ready for that. Cause someday I'm going to be the owner of my company and, uh, and not an owner operator, but just an owner. And that is really freedom. That's what we're trying to get to inside of business. So I hope that helps. Uh, thanks JLD for everything. You're amazing, man. And I will talk to you soon. All right. That was fun. I hope you guys enjoyed, uh, enjoyed the, the Q and a stories. Those will show up on Instagram here in the near future. So, um, you'll be able to see how we're using, um, that those as well.

I'd like to welcome you guys now to the section of the show, um, where I'm going to be talking about, this is like class time. I'm going to be professor Russell Brunson. And today we're going to be talking about the evolution of marketing. And I'm really excited. We have some fun pictures. I'm going to talk to you guys about how funnels came to be. Cause some of you guys are like, well, Russell, when did the funnel get invented? Is that last year? I'm like, no, this is not something we just invented. So we're going to go back to the very, very beginning of time, back to the prehistoric bartering time. Okay. So if you watch this here, this is prehistoric bartering. Back then the way that people traded stuff is they bartered. This dude's got a goat. She's got some fish and he's like, I really want to eat fish tonight. I want some sushi and she's like, sweet. I need some goat milk. Is that really a thing? And so they traded it straight across and it was bartering and bartering was awesome. Except for the fact that you're like, well, my goats really cool. I need like 400 fish to like, and it just, it got kind of complicated. But that's where all began was, was prehistoric bartering. Okay. The next phase about 5000 BC is where the very first time they started finding actual like the archeologists have found coins, at least metal objects. They believe were coins, right? And so this is when instead of just bartering, you could actually create value and put value inside of a coin and then you say, Hey, I want this goat. Cool. I'm going to give you 10 coins and now you could, now money started becoming a thing and it made bartering so much easier because it wasn't like, I don't need 400 fish dude. Right. From my goat and said, you're like, Hey, here's five, here's five bucks. Here's your goat. And then you can go buy fish with your money and you can buy things, the money. And that's what happened next was the bartering system. Okay. After that, in the early 1700s, 1800s, this is where the snake oil salesman began. So this is the dude selling the snake and there's a really good Dan Kennedy book. Everybody should read. If you go to Amazon and search Dan Kennedy believe, make them believe, it's called, make them believe. That's what's called. Make them believe about traveling salesman. I don't think I can tell you guys what he sold on the show because it's rated like not G, but you should go read the book. It's really, really fascinating. But this was next phase, 1700, 1800s. This is where salesman started using a sales pitch where instead of just bartering, they would go together and they'd get a whole bunch of people in the crowd to come around and then they would then present something to them. Right. Like the farmer's market model, right. Like here I am, get a bunch of people and then I can sell instead of selling one on one. Now I sell five people at a time or 10 people at a time or 100 people at a time. So traveling snake oil, something went out there and started making some money by doing a performance, getting the crowd all excited, just like we do when we sell stuff online. Right. Okay. Fast forward now to the 1800s. This is where the gold rush started happening. And what was interesting during the gold rush is that the people who made the most money during the gold rush were not the people panning for gold. Right. It was the people who were selling the shovels panning for gold. In fact, I want to my favorite stories about this. There's a guy named Sam Brennan. It was in San, I believe in San Francisco during the gold rush. And Sam was really smart. He saw these things, all these people coming to California to go pan for gold and make a much money. And he was like, wait a minute, instead of doing that, what if I, what if I sell the tools, the picks and the shovels? And so he went around all of San Francisco, bought all the picks and the shovels and the tools, brought him to his own shop. And then he got a little bit of gold and he started running through the streets in San Francisco saying, there's gold in the American River, there's gold in the American River. And people started freaking out like, oh, we need to find some gold. And then they're like, we need shovels. And he's like, oh, I had to sell these shovels over here. And Sam Brennan became the very first millionaire in California history. So that was when the gold rush happened. People started learning, man, there's a lot of money, not just in the thing, but in the selling of the tools of the thing. Now we're going to fast forward to 1830s. We have P.T. Barnum, who is my man. If you guys have seen The Greatest Showman, this is a story about his life. He's written so many amazing books. Joe Vitale wrote a book about P.T. Barnum's life called There's a Customer Born Every Minute, which is one of my favorite books. But P.T. Barnum really was one of the very first people to really start doing a lot of advertising and things like that. He didn't just like have a show. He was like putting out leaflets and flyers and pamphlets and said he may have been one of the very first people ever to send out unsolicited mail, aka spam. He was spamming people's mailboxes. If you read There's a Customer Born Every Minute, there's so many crazy stories about how he marketed his business. In fact, my favorite one from P.T. Barnum, two days before he died, he sat down and he wrote his own obituary and he posted it in all the newspapers. And he wasn't dead yet. And people became like, why did you, why in the world did you publish your own obituary? And his quote was like the coolest thing ever. He said, I thought that the, I thought that the announcement of my death would help sell tickets to the circus. I was like, I love this dude. So I'm hoping that on my death that I can promote something to you guys as well because I respect P.T. Barnum. All right. Next, 1886, 822. This is where selling at the top started. This is John H. Patterson was the president of the National Cash Register. And instead of him going to sell a whole bunch of people, he would go find an organization. He would sell the person at the top of goat and convince them that everybody below them needed goats. And he was, and so he'd just make one sell the influencer and then the influencer then starts selling everybody else in their, in their, in their company, in their team, whatever that might be. And so that was kind of when this like selling to the top became a thing. Then we fast forward now to 1898. This was the invention of the very first funnel. So 1898, this was way before I was born. In case anyone's wondering how old I am. So Eli St. Elmo Lewis, he had a, ran an ad agency. And he came up with this first concept of that there were four stages of awareness. And if you look at this as AIDA, and it's something we still use today in direct response marketing, but it was the very first funnel say, okay, at the top of the funnel, you gotta give someone awareness so you even exist. Then you have to create an interest like, oh, I'm interested in that. Then you create desire like, oh my gosh, I need that thing. And then you get someone to take the action. Okay. AIDA. And this is still a principle today we think about, we talk about all the time. In fact, if you're marketing struggling, it's probably because you're going straight for the action. You're like, buy my crap, buy my crap. And you're like, what? You have to get them aware of like, hey, I got some cool stuff like, okay, cool. And then you have to get them interested like, hey, do you know why this is awesome? Because it's going to change your life. Like, I'm interested in that. Then you create desire like, let me tell you stories about how it affected this person's life and this person's, all these different things that you create desire. And then you ask for them to take action. Okay. So even today, this principle is extremely powerful. And that came up in 1898, which is pretty cool. All right. In the 1920s, we started taking marketing and business and promotion to the airways. 1920s radio burst on the scene. Del Carnigaro had friends and influence people, which is an amazing book, by the way, that taught the importance of relationships and people. And in the 40s, traveling salespeople were seen going door to door, selling stuff that way as well. In the 1940s and the 50s, this is where video killed the radio star. So where TV came out. And when you read the Traffic Secrets book, I actually have a whole case study about this. But Bolva Watch was the very first TV commercial ever. TVs were getting put out every, all over the place. And then during, it was during one of the World Series games, Bolva Watch came on and it was a 10 second ad that cost nine cents. And it was the picture of the watch and said, the world runs on Bolva. In fact, if you Google or if you go to YouTube and search Bolva ad, you can actually see the original ad. It was like the worst ad ever, but it was the first ad that like interrupted people while they were watching a sporting event, interrupted them and created desire for a thing, which was the beginning of all interruption based marketing, which is what made Zuckerberg famous and all of us rich. So when you read the Traffic Secrets book, that part will make a lot more sense. All right, 1960s. This is the rapid evolution. This is where telemarketing started coming out. 1,800 number is multi-level marketing. People started using all sorts of selling techniques. There's a really good book called Spin Selling that came out where instead of just going on and trying to sell stuff, Spin Selling got people thinking differently like, hey, instead of me selling something, I need to look at myself as a consultant. And they started shifting the way that they sold things to create desire and to become a consultant and became just a better way to sell. That happened 1960s, 1980s, 1990s. This is where the internet started coming about. We started surfing the web. You've seen the picture. The goat here is on a surfboard. And this is where things really started transitioning. The power of the internet made it where instead of just the big brands like the Procter and Gamble and people who could spend a million dollars on an ad on TV, the internet gave the ability where people like us could spend a little bit of money and get exposure in eyeballs and be able to target directly the kind of people we're looking for. 1990s is how it's happening. 2000s, this is where it became easier and easier. This is where tools started coming out, CRMs, marketing systems, email out, responders, things like that that made this whole marketing game even better. And then 2010, this is where funnels started becoming a thing. Companies like HubSpot popped out. Other ones, they started building tools. They started taking people through processes. And then 2014, this is where influencers started popping up all over the place. People become skinny goat tea. I love the designers weaving the goats through everyone's images. It makes me really happy. So influencers started coming in where they can now affect product sales. It wasn't just you buy ads from Zuckerberg. It was like you buy ads from people all directly, all sorts of people. And 2015, 2019, this is where we helped create the future. Dotcom Secrets, which was my very first book ever came out. T talking about funnels. ClickFunnels came out about the exact same time as well. People started building funnels online. And now we are five years into this whole mission and we are at, we passed 100,000 active members last week, which is insane. So we're 100,000 entrepreneurs using this and it is growing. We've sold, what's the stat? $4.1, $4.2 billion in the process through ClickFunnels. The week in track, it is insane. And that is the history of funnels in a nutshell. I hope you guys enjoyed that section because now we're going to move on to the classroom. I'm going to get a drink of water first. We're going to go with that history lesson. Now you guys all know the history of marketing. You guys will see in the Traffic Seekers book, I share a lot of, I share a lot of the history of stuff. A lot of people like, they come into traffic like, oh, Google ads or oh, Facebook ads. It's like, oh, you don't understand, like these are all just just the new iteration of, of direct response and door to door and like all these different things. And we show the history lessons behind them all, how they relate back. Because we understand the history where they came from, then you can understand where we're going in the future. Okay. All right. We're going to move to the classroom. I'm going to drop this down. We're going to teach. Okay. You guys ready for this? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. 100%. Okay. Make sure everything ready for this. Okay. Are we live on this camera now? Okay. Hey everybody, this is Russell Brunson and today we're talking about sales funnels, tutorials for beginners. And to do that, I want to show you guys my very first sales funnel I built as a beginner. In fact, this is a picture of me here on the slide. This is me with my shaved head making a potato gun. This is the very first, one of the very first landing pages for how to make a potato gun.com. And there's a dude with me shooting potato guns because I am a potato gun expert. But we're going to talk about just the basic concepts behind a sales funnel, because I think at first people get all complicated. Like, oh, it's going to be really difficult. It's going to be hard. But when we understand this is really, really simple. And as I'm going through this in the comments down below, I would love if you'd be like, oh my gosh, like I get how this works for me. Okay. And like for your specific business. So I'm going to show you how I did this initially with my very first product, how to make a potato gun, which is still probably the favorite product I've ever created. A lot of people didn't believe it was actually a real thing. So the last Funhacking Live, or two Funhacking Lives ago, I went printed a copy and gave it to every single person. And from that, somebody made me this potato gun, which is actually followed the plans to a tee. So here is an actual potato gun. I don't know if you can see on the camera or not, but we're going to walk you through this. Okay. So when I first created this with my buddy Nate Plung, I was going to college at the time. I was trying to figure out how to make money on the internet. And someone said, you should sell information products. I was like, that's awesome, but I don't know anything about anything. And then that weekend was spring break. And Nate and I went and we made potato guns. Had a great weekend. And then fast forward to like the next Monday and back in school, sitting there kind of like doing the board school thing. And also then I was like, wait a minute, I know how to make a potato gun now. That's an information, information kind of credit product about that. And so I was freaking out. I went online at a time there's a website you could, you could search to see how people were searching for, for different keywords. And there were 18,000 people a month searching for the, the phrase how to make a potato gun or potato gun plans or spud gun plans. And nobody had a product. And I was like light bulb, I'm going to make a product teaching that. So I got Nate, we went down to Home Depot, we got a video camera out, we filmed this whole thing. And we made our very first, very first product, right? So I put the product. Okay. And, and I put it online and I didn't know how to sell anything. So I just had like a basic website. The website was like, hey, come and buy my thing. And then I went to this thing called Google. You guys may have heard of it before. And on Google, they had these things right here on the side. There were these ads. And so I would pay for the Google ad. So I'm going to click on the ad, they'd come over here, they would see this thing and they're like, oh my gosh, I must buy this DVD so I can learn how to make a potato gun. And some of them would give me money. Initially when we first started selling this, we were selling it for 37 bucks a piece. And so people would buy that. And that was my business. And I remember putting the ads up and I was spending about 10 bucks a day. Let me do the math over here. So I was spending $10 a day in ads over here. And from that, I was averaging about one sell a day. Okay. Now as a college kid, I'm looking at this and said, okay, I give someone 10, I give Mr. Google 10 bucks. And then he gives me back 37. Means I got $27 to put in my pocket. Next day I gave Mr. Google 10 bucks. He gave me back 37. I put 27 in my pocket. I kept doing this. And I was like, I am the smartest man alive. I figured this thing out. It is amazing. I was freaking out. It was like the greatest thing ever. Right. And then something evil happened. The guys over at Google decided they want to make more money. And so they changed their algorithms. I'm not going to get into that. But they changed their algorithm. And so no longer was it like, I spent $10 and I make 37. Instead I started spending $10. Excuse me. Like my ad cost went up. So I started spending $50 a day to make one sell. Okay. Now I'm not the sharpest tool in the toolbox, but I gave Google 50 bucks and they gave me back 37. And I was like, wait, I lost money. And then I gave them 50 and then I lost 37. And after three or four days, I'm like, wait a minute. This game sucks. I'm losing. And so I turned my ads off. I'm like, I can't play this game. And I remember thinking at the time I was like, I was like, I missed the internet boom, like the bubble pop. I remember hearing on the news the time people talking about the online bubble popping. I was like, I missed it. I missed the whole thing. How many of you guys ever felt that way before? We were like, I missed the big thing. If you ever felt that way, comment down below. And be like, I felt that before. It's frustrating. Right. So I remember I turned it off and I was like, great. I got to go back to school and start paying attention again because I thought I was going to be rich. Now I'm going to be broke. And I remember being frustrated. And then one day I got a call from my friends. And my friends had a similar business to me. He wasn't selling potato guns. His product was not nearly as cool as that. But he was selling products. And he had the same thing. He got the Google slap and stopped working. And he called me one day and he said, hey, Russell, I think I figured it out. I said, figure what out? He's like, I stopped. And he didn't call it the funnel. He's like, I created this thing called an upsell. He called it an OTO, one time offer. He said, what I did is that every single person about my product, I then upsold them something else. And I was like, well, why would I do that? He's like, well, have you ever been to McDonald's before? Like, yeah. He's like, well, you know, you go to McDonald's and you go through the drive-thru and you're like, hey, I want to order a Big Mac. And the dude's like, cool. Do you want a supersize? Do you want fries and a Coke with that? And he starts offering you upsells. I'm like, yeah. He's like, if you look at the math, he's like McDonald's actually loses money selling a Big Mac. But they make all their profits and buys the fries and the Coke. I was like, OK. And he's like, right now you're losing money selling your potato gun DVD. You just got to sell these guys fries and Coke and you'll be profitable. And I was like, I still look quite good. He's like, well, what like, he's like, what do you like, if someone buys this, like, what's the next thing you can do? If you're trying to serve this person, like, what's the next thing you could serve him with? I said, well, when someone buys the DVD, the most annoying thing is not have to go to home deep on that to buy the pipes and to cut them and like, all this stuff to make this amazing gun. He said, well, what if instead of you telling them to go buy the stuff, what if you upsold them a kit that did this whole thing? I have no idea if this is going to show up on camera or not. I thought it would kind of cool. And so he said, make it upsell where you sell them the kit. So here is the kit. And so I did some math and I started calling around. And I found these guys, Northern Idaho, actually made potato gun kits. And so they would sell me the kits. And I would start selling these for $197. And so I made this. And now this became my very first funnel ever. Again, I didn't know it was called the funnel time. So when they come, they click on the ad, they would see my DVD, they would buy my DVD. On the next page, our upsells say, hey, the DVD's coming. Do you want me to ship the pipes with you too so to save you some time? Just $197. You'd be like, that would be fantastic. And they click the button, they would buy it. Now what happened, if you look at the math, was interesting. So Google didn't change their ad costs. They still were charging me $50 a day. So that didn't change. But they came here and I spent $37. So I lost some money. But then what happened is that one out of three people who bought the DVD would buy this, right? So let's say I got a bunch of clicks over here. Boom. And so there's three people right here that bought the DVD. One of these people then would go and buy this. So if you do the math on this, again, I'm not a mathematician, so I'm probably going to screw this up. For every DVD I sold, so I make $37, one third of those people bought this. So I take $197, I divide it by three. But I do the math on that, that's $65. So if I take $65 plus $37, $7 plus 5 equals 12, not 910, 102. So now I was making $102 for every single person who bought the DVD. Does that make sense? Because one out of three bought the kid as well. So now I was on Google, I was paying $50 a day in ads. But I was making on average $102 a day. I put $50 in, I got $102 back. And all of a sudden, I started looking and I was like, I am the smartest man alive again. I spent $50, I get back $102. $50 and now they started working. I was freaking out. And so I was back in business, paid my guns sales were cranking, I was having a good time. And I realized, wait a minute, potato guns are good, but the market's like this little. What other markets could I do this with? And I started thinking, I said, well, what if I did this in speed reading? I met a guy who was the world's fastest reader, Howard Burke. And so we set up a funnel for speed reading and it worked. And we said, well, if we do this in the dating market, I found someone who's a dating expert, we plugged in. What if we do this with supplements? What if we do it? And we started doing this. And the funnels obviously tweak every single time, but the concepts are the same. And I became obsessed. And over the next five or six years, I launched over 100 different funnels and 100 different products and became obsessed with it. And it became so much fun. But this concept of a funnel works in any business. And so what I want you guys to understand is this how simple it really is. It's not some complicated thing. Sometimes we get all complicated. It's very simple. It's like we buy an ad to sell something, right? Somebody buys that thing. Then what's the next logical thing they need? Well, they bought a potato gun. The next thing they need is they need a potato gun kit. And that becomes my funnel. And that's kind of where we take people through, okay? And so that's the basics of a sales funnel for all you guys who've been wondering what it is. And I'm curious for all of you guys who are listening now, if you can think for yourself, like what is a funnel you could create for your business, okay?

Now, if you don't have a sales funnel yet, that's okay. This is gonna give you ideas for like, oh my gosh, I could do this, I could do this, I could do this. If you do have a sales funnel, it's not doing that well. These seven tips are gonna give you ideas on how to tweak them and change them to make them even better. I think you guys are gonna love these. So I'm gonna jump right into them right now. As you guys are hearing these, I want you to vote down below. What is your favorite tip? Okay, there's seven. Each one's gonna get a little bit more complicated as we go. But down below, let me know if it's number one you like. And number three, like, I want you to get all voting on which one is the coolest tip. I tried to find some really cool, fun, exciting ones. Some of you may have heard of before, some may be brand new, regardless. Hopefully you guys will all get something out of these seven simple sales funnel marketing tips. All right, you guys ready for this? Number one, you need to add more curiosity to your headlines to increase conversions. Okay, these are some of my friends, Mike and AJ, they're in my inner circle. And what's interesting is they came in inner circle and they're like, Russell, we have this webinar and it's sucking. I'm like, what do you mean? Like, it's horrible. Like, right now we're spending $24.85 to get somebody to register for the webinar and only 22% of people actually show up. They're like, how do we fix our webinar? And I was like, I don't even touch your webinar because I'm just gonna tweak one little thing. I said, when I read your headline, it says, how to add six figures to your web design business by copying my secret method for helping companies get more real five-star reviews without selling, spending a lot of time and money. I said, when I read that, I know exactly what the webinar's about, your webinar's gonna show me how to get reviews for local customers. And if I'm like, I think I know how to do that, I'm not gonna show up. I said, that's why your ad cost is so expensive and that's why your show operates so low and most people are like, I'll register but I think I already know so I'm not gonna make it that important for me to actually show up. If I said, all you gotta do is just add more curiosity to your headline, just don't tell me what it is, tell me what it's not. The more curiosity I have, the more likely I am to actually show up and so he changed that and all he did to this entire webinar is he just changed the headline. So here's the old landing page, here's the new one. Now the headline says, how I added six figures to my web company by adding this one easy to offer service that doesn't require cold calling, spending lots of time, money or required extra resources. And it's not Facebook ads, not SEO, email marketing, website, social media, graphics, I'm just gonna market your video, register now and find out what it is. All it is just ramped up the curiosity. You're like, what is it? Like, I know what it's not but I've no idea what it actually is. Okay, another increase in curiosity makes people freak out and guess what happened? Two amazing things, number one, their ad cost went from, do you remember what it was before? From $24.85 to $5.84, okay? The ad cost dropped dramatically down and then the show up rate went from 22% to like now over a third of the people like I gotta find out what it is. I don't even know what it is. Okay, ad cost dropped down, show up rate shot up and everything changed inside this webinar. They didn't even, they didn't change the webinar at all, they just changed the landing page, okay? So the very first secret I wanted to share with you guys is that add more curiosity to your headlines, increase your conversion rates, your show up rates and everything. Okay, don't tell them what it is, tell them what it is not and it'll get people to have more desire to figure out what it is that you are actually doing. Okay, that's number one, he was like that. He's like number one, let me know and have a look. Like number one was awesome. Okay, I guarantee for almost all of you guys, if you came to me and hired me as a consultant, I'd look at your headline like, let's just change that. That'll probably change your entire business, okay? So those little tiny levers that swing a huge door. Okay, number two, you need to grow your list by using a lead magnet. So what is lead magnet? Okay, you guys have all seen lead funnels before. It's a funnel, if someone comes on a page, you're like, hey, I'll give you this really, really cool thing if you give me your email address and then they give you email address and then you give them the cool thing and then from there you push them to the next page in your value ladder, what's the next thing? Okay, the very first time I ever learned about lead magnets and I wanna show you guys the story because I think it'll give some of you guys a ha. Was back almost 15 years ago, it was a guy who's become a friend now, his name's Evan Pagan, he owned a company called Double Your Dating. And I remember he was one of the very first people ever to have a landing page like this, we call them squeeze pages. And I remember coming to this page, I was so confused. It says, you're about to learn secrets that most men will never know about women. Inside, you're gonna learn the kiss test and how to tell if you should be ready to be kissed and a bunch of other things. And we're looking at this page and I was like, this is the weirdest thing I've ever seen. Okay, and a lot of you guys have seen pages like this but 15 years ago, I was confused. And I remember I was at a marketing seminar and some guys said, yeah, this page right here, this company is $20 million a year online. And this was like the homepage of the other side, I was like, what? Doesn't make any sense. And he said, yeah, they drive all the traffic here, they get a list and then they sell the person other products and services on the backend. And I remember I wanted to funnel hack it and go in but I had just gotten married to my beautiful wife, Colette, and she would have strangled me if I had signed up for a dating list. So I called her up, I was like, Colette, I'm doing some market research, I need to opt in this thing, are you okay with that? I'm gonna get emails but I'm not wandering, I'm just trying to figure out the marketing behind it. And she's like, okay, no worries. So I went and I subscribed to find out what in the world is the kiss test they're gonna tell me about. So I put my email address in and it took me to this next page and there's like two or three paragraphs that teach the kiss test, okay? It wasn't like a 55 minute video or a 39 page ebook, it was like two paragraphs, basically said, okay, this is the kiss test. You walk a girl to the door, okay? You're talking to him, you reach up and you touch the tips of her hair, okay? If she pulls her head back, I mean she does not wanna be kissed, like don't kiss her, like run away. But if she turns her head into you, that means she's into you and she wants you to kiss her. And I was like, oh my gosh, that's the kiss test. It's when I shared this, we do an event called Unlock the Secrets where they have the teenagers come as well and I shared this at that event when one of the teenagers yelled out. He was like, that's amazing. So for the right demographic, that is like the biggest aha, right? The lead magnet was a paragraph but it gave them the aha, okay? Then after that, Lauren Page says, okay, if you like that, you should go read my book called Double Your Dating, click here and then people go buy the book, okay? But it was a page where they give me your email address, okay, you're becoming a lead. I'm gonna give you this lead magnet, which it's gonna get, it's not, it doesn't have to be this huge complicated thing, it can be a two or three paragraphs, giving them an aha and if they're, it pushes them now to go buy the very first product and your value ladder. And they took that little concept and built a $20 million business from it, okay? So number two, secret number two, you gotta create a lead magnet to grow your list, okay? So if you guys like number two, post down below, be like number two was amazing, I love it, aha! Okay, you guys ready for number three? So number one was add more curiosity to your headlines. Number two was create a lead magnet to grow your list. Number three is build your sales pages for optimal conversions. Okay, this is something that I assumed everybody understood until I shared it with my team and they were all like, what? If you look at, when we sell anything, there's three phases of selling, okay? The first phase is emotion, okay? That's why I tell a story, you all emotionally engage and the majority of people will buy off of motion. But there's some people like emotionally you sell them and you're like, ah, but then they start logically trying to justify, right? So we start with emotion, then we shift to logic and then we move to urgency and scarcity, right? People who are fear-based like, you just have to push them over the edge, okay? If you look at any sales presentation that I do, you'll always see this. In the email sequence I do, I always do this, right? The first email is a very emotional basis. Second email is a logical basis. The third email is our urgency and scarcity and fear-based. Okay, every sales process, every sales funnel we take people through, we take them through the same journey from emotion to logic to fear. So a lot of people understand is I do the exact same thing on the actual landing page. Okay, if you go to any of my pages, like here's the dot com secrets book, right? Or the expert secrets book, any of those books. The land, this page here, the whole top section is all focused on emotion, okay? The hook is emotional, the video is emotional. Everything here is like emotion. That's my best selling technique is emotion. So the top third of my page is all focused on emotion, okay? And for the majority, if you put like a heat map on this and you watch it, like 90% of people like see that and they go and they buy, right? All emotional buyers like, I'm in, let's go do this thing. Okay, but then you have the next group, the logical people, right? They're emotional, I want this, but like, does this really make sense? Does it go okay for me? And like, they start logically trying to justify everything, right? So what happens is that those people like, they need more information, they start scrolling. So then they start scrolling the page and they go down a little bit further. And now we start having these things where we logically, okay, the second section is logically, we give all the logical arguments, like, you're gonna learn this, you're gonna learn this, you're gonna learn this, logically understand that you need this to grow your company. Logically, and like, we speak to the logic of somebody in the second section, okay? So my scrollers are my logical buyers. So if you watch your heat maps, you'll notice during this section, people are scrolling, a bunch of people start buying. These are your logical buyers who are like, okay, that was the thing I needed right there to get me to go and buy, okay? And then you just go on even further, then I moved to the last thing, which is urgency and scarcity, okay? Some people just, they have to be pushed over the edge. Like, they need that last little push. So the last bottom page is all focused on urgency and scarcity. This is why you need to buy it and why you need to buy it right now, okay? So whenever your urgency and scarcity limits are, some people it's like, you'll have X amount of the products and there's the timeline, like, I don't care what it is, you gotta figure out a true, real urgency and scarcity to push people over. And that is how we structure a sales page. Emotion, logic, and fear. And once again, if you look at this path, you'll notice this is how we break down every single auto responder signal. So first females are motion, then logic, then fear. Every product launch, every video, every webinar, like that pattern you'll see over and over and over again. And when you read the Traffic Seekers book, I talk a lot about it as well. So that's number three, how many of you guys like number three? Emotional, logical, fear as it relates to your actual landing page. If you like that, let me know down below in the comments. I wanna hear it and I wanna start seeing your votes. Is it one better, is three better, is two better? Like, let me know which one is the one you like the most. All right, number four, offer an order form bump to increase sales. This is one of the things that seems so simple now, but literally 10 years ago when we kind of discovered this, changed all of our businesses forever. Okay, the order form bump, I want you to visualize, imagine you're at the grocery store, right? And you gotta go buy some stuff. So you're at the grocery store and you're buying hot dogs and ketchup and buns and chips, and you're doing all the stuff for the big game coming up. And then you're checking out the checkout stand. And as you walk into the checkout stand, you start looking, you're like, oh, National Enquirer, like the world's largest baby, that's hilarious. Grab it and you throw anything, like, oh, tic-tacs. My breast thinks the orange ones taste really good. So you grab some tic-tacs and some gum and a Snickers bar and like the things you're grabbing as you're checking out. That is your order form bump, okay? I don't know if this is true or not. Somebody told me this once, so I'm gonna quote it and it may or may not be true, but somebody told me that a grocery store, they don't make their money selling groceries, they make their money at the checkout stand. Like, the profit of a grocery store comes from the checkout stand. Whether that's true or not, it's very true here at online marketing, okay? So when somebody comes to my pages and they go and buy something, they're buying some stuff and for years we would just sell them the product. We might have upsells and downsells, but somewhere along the line, I saw a page that somebody had, it was a bigger company and they had this thing and what happened is right after somebody puts in their credit card, and this is essentials, after they put in their credit card, but before they click the submit button, they had this little block right here that I started calling up an order form bump. And that was all these other companies called it, but that was my term, just so you all know. Unless you can prove me otherwise, but I'm pretty sure I mentioned that phrase. Anyway, because there used to be phone calls on a phone, they would do a bump sell on a phone, tell marketers, so we started doing this, I said, this is like an order form bump. Anyway, so here's the order form bump, but the key is this, after somebody puts in their credit card, before they put in the thing, you have an offer that's really quick there for $17, $27, $37 in impulse buy. If it's something that needs to be explained over like 10 paragraphs, it's not the right thing. It's you're at the checkout stand, you're like, ooh, tick tax. That's what you're looking for, and off here, if you're selling a book, like hey, do you want the audio book? Or if you're selling a training course, like hey, do you want the templates? Like it's got an impulse buy that you add right there. And in most of our funnels, the profit that comes from this covers our ad spend. It covers the Google ads, the Facebook ads, or whatever that thing might be. And so it's one of the most powerful little ninja sell things you can add to any funnel that literally will cover all your ad costs. Now everything else you sell in the funnel becomes pure profit. It all comes down to this one little block right here, the order form bump that happens between the credit card number and before the submit button right there, and it is magic. So there's the order form bump. If you're using click funnels, it is so simple, you just click add order form bump and boom, it's there and you've got it working for you. So that's secret number four. What do you guys think, get it number four? Okay, so now we got one, two, three, four. We got curiosity, it's number one. Number two, I can't remember anymore. Hopefully you guys remember at home and you're casting your votes. All right, number five, as we're creating upsells, this is one of the biggest problems people make when they have upsells. Somebody has buys your product and you have the upsell page, right? And what the biggest mistake most people make is the upsell page happens and they say, thank you for your order. We have received your order. And they close the loop. Okay, as soon as you close, like thank you so much for your order. We're excited to ship this out to you, whatever. You just close the buying loop in their mind. Okay, and in their mind it's over. Okay, and as soon as you do that, your conversions on whatever happens afterwards will dramatically decrease. And this is based on thousands and thousands of tests. The goal on the upsell page, you have to keep the buying loop open. So if you notice any of my upsell pages, they never say like, thank you so much for your order. It always stops and says like, wait, your order's not yet complete. Don't shut this page down. I have to keep the buying loop open. Like it's not done yet. We need to customize your orders. You want to add some other cool things to your order before we close this thing out. Okay, I do not close the loop. I keep it open during the upsell process. Okay, I've had people before who come to us for consulting and like they have this upsell. And the only thing we change is from like, thank you for your order. It's like, wait, your order's not yet complete and increases conversions dramatically. So number five is keeping the buying loop open to identify your hyperactive buyers. Don't close it, keep it open for them. Don't tell them the sales over say, it's not over yet and then keep them, keep the loop open as you're going through it. So that's number five. Number six, after someone goes to your funnel and land on your thank you page, you can create what we call an offer wall. And an offer wall is how you can push people into your other value ladders. So for example, listen right here. This is the thank you page for buying one of our products. And down below it says, oh, by the way, here's another cool stuff. You could join our funnel university. You get a dot com secret book, you get a hundred split test book. And all this is free traffic that comes to you. Okay, so that's when it's gone through your sales funnel and they land on your thank you page. Don't think that they're done buying. What typically happens is that for a lot of people, especially the hyperactive buyers, they're like, this is awesome. They start looking for more stuff to buy. And they buy from your competitors. Another competitor is you're like, you lost them. So why not just allow them to continue with you in the process? So on the thank you page, make an offer wall. We say, here's other cool stuff we sell. Feel free to come jump in these funnels as well. And you'll see, you'll be shocked at how much additional revenue and sales come by just adding this thing on the thank you pages of everything you sell. That's number six. And I got one more. You guys ready for the last one? There's a little bit more of an advanced tip, but it works really, really good. What we do is we add a webinar to the thank you page to increase sales. So if you look at a bunch of our funnels, the very last page is like, thank you so much for ordering the product. Now, I wanna start your training right now. The product is being shipped to you in the mail. You're gonna get it. We're gonna start right now. We're gonna get into business and we start teaching right away. And this thank you page is the webinar. So I thank them for the order and that transition to teaching. I give them the one thing. I give them the three secrets. And the end of it, then I make an offer for my high ticket product. And that is one of the most powerful things we started doing is adding the thank you page webinars. We're now a percentage of all the people who buy one of our free plus shipping books start buying our $2,000 product we sell at the back as well. And that is what a thank you page webinar is. So there are your seven tips. I wanna know which one is your favorite. I'm gonna go through them all again really quickly. Number one, I want you to vote for your favorite in the comments down below. So number one, a lot of cool slides here. Number one was increase more, or add more curiosity to your headline, increase conversions. Number two is create lead magnets to grow your list.

Oh yeah, number five, keeping the buying loop open in your upsells. Number six was offer wall. And number seven was adding a thank you page webinar to automatically sell the next product in your value ladder to people. And that is what it is.

Just kidding. Let's see, how should I do this? No, one at a time, one at a time. Russell, you will be fired if you. Just kidding. Okay. Um, all right, move that a little bit. I'm glad this is a live show that's like broken into segments so I can catch my breath between them. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this. I'm gonna have to do this so I can catch my breath between them. Jimmy Fallon's got commercials. What do I got? Nothing. Okay. All right, here we go. Okay, for this next session, session segment. Okay. All right, for this next segment, I'm gonna be going through and sharing a bunch of pictures and stories behind the pictures with you guys. And the reason why I'm doing this is, in the Traffic Seekers book, the section on Instagram, I quote super heavily from one of my friends who is one of the coolest people I've ever met. Her name's Janet Kutcher. You guys know her and you follow her. And she has a process called the JK5 where basically she says, okay, on your Instagram profile, or when you're, and honestly it works in anything, in your emails, in your blogs, and everything, it's like, instead of just like always talking about the one thing that gets really, really boring, and you look like a one-sided person, she says like, pick five categories of things you're interested in, and then rotate your post. So she has this thing called the JK5 method, where she's like, I have five categories of my life that I focus on, and I rotate through my pictures on Instagram through these different five things. And I thought it was really powerful. I've been trying to do that in my podcast, just all different aspects of me publishing is rotating through five different categories. So I was gonna share with you my five categories, and then show some pictures related to those five categories. That's not like fun? So my five categories are family, funnels, faith, entrepreneurship, and personal development. These are the five things that I'm kind of the most passionate about. And so the pictures I was sharing, the podcast, all the things I'm doing, I'm rotating through these different five different topics. I'm not perfect, like it's always like, this has to be family and funnel, but like you'll see this trend of these categories, and everything I'm publishing, I'm rotating over and over and over again. So I'm gonna start at the very beginning with my favorite topic, which is my family. So we just got family pictures. That's me, I'm the guy with the big fat head in the middle. It's my beautiful wife, Collette, and we have twin boys, Dallin and Bowen. Then we have Ellie, and we've got Aiden, and we've got Nora. So these are my five kids and my beautiful wife, and these are the people I mean the most in the world to me. And it's been fun. In fact, one of the things we learned from Jen and when we were in Fiji, she said, a lot of people will go and get family pictures like once, every two or three years, because there's so much stress and headache. And of all people, I know how horrible family pictures are. But she said, she said, every single quarter you should get family pictures. And just hire, it can be a basic of a target. It doesn't be something fancy, but get dressed up and get pictures, and just do it once a quarter. And if you do that, what'll happen is, first off, the stress of taking pictures will go down, because it's not like this, ah, the frazzle of trying to get pictures on. But number two is, you have more pictures of your kids throughout your life. And looking back in a year from now, five years from now, 10 years from now, you'll be super grateful. So we got back from Fiji. I was the very first thing we implemented from Jen, and we called the photographer, and we got our family pictures done. This is the first of our family pictures. You'll probably see a bunch from the set, posting on Instagram and Facebook, in different places, because I'm so excited. But this is my family. And I wanted to share this with her initially, because I think so many of us, we get into business initially, because I want freedom, so I can spend more time with my family. And then we get into business, and it's so much fun, and we get addicted to the significance and the certainty, and all the things that come with being entrepreneurs and what happens so often is, is we are pursuing this thing. We forget about the reason why we started this thing. And I've seen so many entrepreneurs who achieve everything, and they lose their family in the process. And one of my favorite quotes is from a man named David O. McKay, he said that, no success can compensate for failure in the home. And so I wanted to start this session by showing this picture of my family, and to remember this. Last night, I had a chance to go with my entire family to bowing it down, had a wrestling match. I had a chance to go down there and to coach them, and all the kids were in the stands, cheering on their brothers, and it was just such a fun, unique experience. And this is why we do all these things, right? This is the most important, most vital, and most powerful part of what we do. So I just want to show that in the beginning, is that no success can compensate for failure in the home. All right. Second picture on our show, it ties back to funnels. So this is a video, or this is a picture, from the day that I taught Gary Vee about funnels. So we did, when we launched the ClickFunnels viral video, the very first one we did with the Harman Brothers, we did a big, huge party. We ran out of boys' state football stadium. We invited a ton of influencers to come. We set a world record doing bubble soccer. We had the biggest bubble soccer game in the history of the world. Got a Getsberger World Record for it, and we decided to invite Gary Vee to come speak, because he is obviously someone who's a big influencer. And it's interesting, because Gary's all about branding and things like that, and I don't think he, he spent a lot of time thinking about metrics and funnels, and someone, it's interesting because I have people all the time who talk about the difference between me and Gary, and they're like, Gary's all about branding, and you're about direct response marketing, and I think the reality is, is that both of those things are essential in today's market. Just having good direct response in funnels is half of it. Having really good branding and storytelling is half of it, and when you blend these two things and weave them together, that is the power. And so this is actually a picture of Gary watching the viral video with us at the ClickFunnels bubble soccer event we did two years ago, and just kind of one of my favorite pictures is we're introducing him to the world of funnels. They still don't have very many funnels over there VaynerMedia, but I'm guessing eventually they'll have to open a division because if their companies really wanna grow, they need funnels. So there you go, there's a picture of me and Gary Vee. This is a picture of me dressed as Prince Charming with my beautiful queen and princesses. So this is obviously, there's Collette, my wife, and Ellie, and Norris, can hardly see, upside down. This is a early issue, and she has to do a fairy tale experience with one of our MITRE Circle members. She's the fairy godmother, and she does these experiences, so she brought her whole equipment up to Boise and let us come and do this thing. And I wanna show this picture for a couple of reasons. Number one, it's just a really fun day I had with the women in my life that are so important. Number two is I wanted to talk about, like whenever we're, as entrepreneurs, we have to visualize things, we have to have faith in this thing, right? We have an idea, I'm gonna build this thing called ClickFunnels, I wanna sell this stuff, but whatever, and it's not really yet, right? It's fake. And so when we did this picture here, it was interesting because we're holding this ball, and it was like a black ball, and we're holding it, and she's like, visualize this thing as glowing. And so we're trying to look at the thing, and it wasn't glowing yet, but we had to look out as if it was glowing, and get that look on our eyes, and we believed it was actually glowing. And so we did that, tried to look like, oh my gosh, it's so exciting, they shook the picture. And then in post-production, she added the sparkles and the thing, and it looked beautiful and amazing, right? And I was looking at thinking about the analogy behind just the fact that so many times it's like, I have an idea for this product, but it's not really, it's just a black ball, and you're like, oh, and you're like, but if you treat it like a black ball, you're not gonna have success with it, right? You have to visualize it like, oh my gosh, this is amazing. Like when we were building ClickFunnels, I remember sitting, like Todd, my co-founder, who codes, he'd fly to Boise, and we'd spend all my years for a week or two at a time sitting there in this room, and like, it wasn't really yet. We had to visualize it like it was real, and we talked about like, yeah, you imagine people are using this in a building funnel, it's like, this becomes the thing that people have to use to grow their businesses, and like, we had this vision of like, we saw the sparkling ball, even though it wasn't sparkling yet, right? I think for all of us, we have to have faith in something bigger than us. We have to have faith in the thing we're trying to create, otherwise you're never gonna actually create it. And so that's what I wanna show this picture, because it was such a tangible experience, but we literally did that with this black ball that then she made in After Effects, or in post-production, made it look all beautiful and shiny, and that's the thing you gotta do inside of yourself, is have faith in this thing you're creating that nobody else can see yet, except for you. And then sometime, a year from now, two years from now, five years from now, when it's blossoming and everybody has a chance to see it, they're like, oh yeah, of course that makes a lot of sense. You're like, well, I knew it before it was a thing. I had faith in it back then when it was just this rock. So there is the story behind this picture. So this is a picture of, this is the Golden Gate Bridge right here, and we had a really cool experience last year to go to Dreamforce. And Dreamforce is Salesforce's big event. They have over 170,000 businesses that come to this event, and Salesforce think they're like, I don't know, $10 or $12 billion a year company, and they're growing rapidly. And I remember going there and just looking at it, and seeing like, this is what we're trying to go for, this is who we're looking to compete with, right? And sitting out there, and this was in the morning, we went, after the event happened, we went super early in the morning to just go look at the Golden Gate Bridge, we got some cool pictures while we were there. But I remember as I'm sitting here thinking about like, visualizing like, okay, this is what we have to create if we're gonna win, right? Like it became very, very real. And I remember, I told a story on a podcast episode, but I remember when I was wrestling growing up, my dad took me to the state tournament, my probably two weeks in my wrestling career, took me to the state tournament, I saw it, and I saw someone win state, and I was like, now that I've seen it, now I can visualize, now I can go and do it, I can become a state champ. And I did. And I remember later in my life, I wanted to become a national champ, and I never had a chance to go to the national tournament ever. And I went, at high school, I went, I took second place in the nation, high school, and college, I never went to the end state tournament, and I never saw it, and I remember, I had a friend though, whose dad would take him to the national tournaments. And he told me that, he said, I didn't even care about being a state champ, I just wanted to be a national champ, because I had seen it, and I saw that it was there, it was possible, like it was just people just like me, and because he was able to see it, he was able to go and get it. And I think for me, this picture really represents, like us being there and seeing Salesforce, I'm like, oh my gosh, if they're not anything special, I think different than us, they've just been doing this long, they've been doing a couple of things different, we can learn from them, we can grow from them, but I have to see it first to understand it. So for all of you guys, I think the big lesson is like, okay, I need to go, like figure out where you're trying to get to, like who's already that level, and then go and pay them if that's what it takes, go look at what they're doing, watch them, see them, study and figure them out, because as soon as you do that, you're like, oh my gosh, it's just people like us. That person's not that much more spectacular than what I am, they're just a different level, now I know what it looks like, now I can go and get it. If I'd gone to the NCAA tournament when I was in high school, man, my whole vision would have been different, my trajectory would have been different because I had seen something different. Instead of my trajectory, I gotta be stay champ, gotta be stay champ, and I got it, but I missed the next level because I never'd seen it before. So always look, what's the next level, go look for that, figure that thing out, find it, and then after you've seen it, now you can go and start working towards it. So there you go for all the entrepreneurs. This right here is my friend, Stephen Larson. And I wanna show this, this is him at his last event, it's called OfferMind, and he invited me to speak, and I had a chance at the end to sit on stage with him and do Q and A on the white couch, which was really, really cool. So we sat there doing the Q and A, and I remember, I don't know if he talked about here, but I remember hearing Stephen talk about this a lot of times. He worked here at ClickFunnels for a couple of years, and two years ago he left to go on his own, and I remember him messaging me a couple of times throughout the thing, and he said, man, he's like, starting your own business is like the biggest personal development course in the world. He's like, all of your flaws, suddenly get pushed in your face. All of your things, you know, like you start seeing him in real time right up close, and he's like, when you start that journey, and I think this was really fun for me to see him on stage in his element, and look at how much he's grown in the last two years, since he left ClickFunnels, to kinda go on his own. And I think for all of you guys, you have to understand that this journey is not gonna be simple, it's gonna be painful. All of your flaws as you are going through this journey are gonna pop up in your face. But starting a business and finding an audience to serve and figuring out the best way to change their life and to do those things is one of the most powerful ways to develop yourself as a person. I talk about this all the time, like, this is your process of becoming who you need to be, and you learn it by going through the pains and the struggles and the trials of entrepreneurship. And so that's the one I wanna share with this picture with you guys, because I've watched Steven as he's grown, I've seen this thing, and I know that for all of you guys who are taking that leap around, you're leaving the job you hate, you're trying the new business, whatever, you're building your first funnel, you're trying to launch it, man, there's gonna be so many things that come up in your face. And a lot of people are gonna wanna shrink back, and think, oh, this is too hard, this is too painful, this isn't fun, and I understand that, but I don't want you guys stopping. I want you to understand those are good things, this is how you refine yourself, how you become better, how you become who you need to be to serve the people that you've been called to serve. If I would have launched ClickFunnels 10 years ago, man, I would have bankrupted the company within the matter of weeks, right? But luckily I had 10 years of me trying to be an entrepreneur failing and failing and falling on my face and falling on my face and falling on my face. So when I was given this gift of like, hey, here's this movement, here's this thing you can now run with, I had been prepared. And it's the same thing for you, like all these things you're doing, all the struggles and frustrations that are falling on your face, are all because it's helping you become who you need to be, so you can serve who you've been called to serve. And so that is the next picture here as it ties back to personal development. All right, I say we skip the next five pictures, what do you guys think, and do those next week, cool. We got more, we're gonna do those next week. So pay attention, okay. So I'm gonna move then to... All right. This is so much fun. Good. All right. This next segment of the show, we have a couple more segments you guys, hope you're all enjoying this. Next segment of the show we're calling is called Words of Wisdom. And this one we wanna share some quotes from people that I respect, that I've learned a lot from, that have had messages that have helped me during difficult times of my life, or times where I needed the next to get the next level. So the first one here is from my man, Theodore Roosevelt. And Theodore Roosevelt said, I forgot how to read these easier. He said, the only man who never makes mistakes is the man who never does anything. And so this is just such a cool quote. And it reminded me of another one of his quotes, it's even longer, so I'm gonna read it, instead of posting it on things it's too hard to read. But it's the quote about the man in the arena. So this is what the quote says. It says, it's not the critic who counts. It's not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who's actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again, because there's no effort without error and shortcoming. But who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows great, the great enthusiasm, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who with the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and with the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly. So his place will never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat. So I shout out to you guys because so many of you, I know this, I've gone through this as well, you're out there and you're trying, and you've got people who want you to fail, people you love who just want you to go back to normal life, and they're hoping you, like they don't want you to fall flat on your face, but they're hoping that you're just, that you're, I don't know how to say it nicely, they want you to live a normal life. And as you're trying to do things beyond yourself, they honestly are like, I kind of hope they fail. Or the people who aren't gonna like you, there's your haters who really do. I think when you understand this, this is something that's gotten me through so many times. In fact, man, this is the last of it here, where it says that if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so his place will never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat. Like for all of us, you guys, as entrepreneurs, we're not there, we're creating, we're trying, we're challenging, we're doing things, we're trying to create, you are gonna fail over and over and over and over and over again, and that's okay because you just need the one success. If I could show you guys how many funnels flop before the ClickFunnels funnel, not just the, I mean, we had six variations, the ClickFunnels funnel before it took off, but prior to that, the 100 plus, 120, 130 plus funnels, I did in a dozen different markets. Had a time that didn't work, then you guys understand like, wow, this is okay, it's not a bad thing to fail, it's a gift that we have to be able to fail, to learn, to grow, and we keep doing it, then we come who we need to be, to be able to serve the people we've been called to serve. So there you go, Theodore Roosevelt. This is Dan Gable, he is our Michael Jordan, he is, in high school and college, when we lost one match ever, they won at the Olympics, and nobody even scored on him, Dan Gable is the man, he has so many good quotes. One thing he says, the gold medals aren't really made of gold, they're made of sweat, determination, and a hard to find alloy called guts from Dan Gable. So I share this one because I think a lot of times, especially in our community, we're looking for the two comma club award, looking for two comma club X, looking for all these kinds of things, and I think coming back to this, understanding that gold medals are not made of gold, right? They're made of all the stuff you have to put in to earn it, okay, the sweat, the determination, the hard to find alloy, I can say the word, alloy called guts. So if you really want to get those things, you want the gold medals, you want the records, you want the prize, you want the money, you want whatever your driving force is, understand that that's what it's made of, is the blood, sweat, determination. So thank you, Dan Gable, for being the man, and for sharing the quote for today. Vince said, practice does not make perfect, only perfect practice makes perfect. Recently I did a podcast episode, kind of ranting on a coaching client, who was not doing things right, and I kind of, I may have got that person a little offended, and I think that sometimes it's hard to be a coach, because you tell people what they need to know, even they don't want to hear it, right? In fact, recently I was coaching Myron Goldin. Myron is one of the most coachable people, and he asked for my advice, and I gave him my advice, and it was completely different than we thought. I said, sorry, I know that's not what you're asking for, he's like, no, that's why I'm paying you. He's like, if I knew what you were gonna tell me, I wouldn't have had to pay you, he's like, I want your different advice, like that's what I'm paying for. And I was wrestling, I used to have a coach, who would always harp on this, like we'd be practicing a move over and over again, he'd stop us, he's like, you're doing it wrong. I'm like, I'm doing the move, he's like, no, no, no, he's like, just because you're doing it, if you're practicing it wrong, you're gonna, it's worse than if you didn't do it at all, because now you're gonna keep doing it wrong over and over and over again, and you're gonna practice the wrong thing, and you're gonna do it wrong. He's like, if you're not doing it, if you're not practicing perfect, it doesn't make any sense to even practice. And so I want you guys to think about this, as you're being coached by people, like don't take it personally, and be like, man, I'm so grateful this person coached me, because I could keep practicing the wrong thing, it'd become really, really good at doing things wrong, or I could shift, I could adjust and practice the right thing, and become perfect at it, and that way, all the practice I'm doing actually helps me, as opposed to making me worse. So there you go, Vincent Bardi, practice does not make perfect, only perfect practice makes perfect. This is from Winston Churchill. And this is when the Nazis were invading and coming into the UK and everything like that, he was in charge, and man, he just has so many good speeches and quotes and stuff like that. And during a lot of times in my life, where things have been down and then hard, and I've been struggling, I turned to Churchill so many times, and this is one of my favorite quotes, talking about the war, he said, "'We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind, "'we have before us many, many long months of struggle, "'and of suffering.' "'You ask, what is our policy?' "'I will say, it is to wage war by sea, "'by land, by air, with all of our might, "'with all of our strength that God has given us.'" That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word, victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory however long and hard the road may be. I think for all of you guys who are out there who are trying to be successful, you have before you an ordeal of the most grievous kind, it's not gonna be easy. You have many long months of struggle and suffering. What is your aim? It's victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of terror, victory however long and hard the road may be. Well, you guys remember that because sometimes this road is long. Now, if I could rewind 15 years ago when I started this journey, if I'd have known it would have been this long and windy, I probably wouldn't have gone on it. There were times, like I said, when we went through, you know, I had to fire 100 people in a day. There were times when I lost friends, lost family members that were working, like so much of this stress and the toil and the things he's talking about. But when you look at it, say, look, victory is what we're going for, however long and hard the road may be. That's the goal, that's where we're going. It gives you the foresight you need to keep moving forward. So Winston Churchill, again, one of my favorite quotes of all time, victory however long and hard the road may be. All right, that is the end of this segment, of this segment, couple more. Whew, how long are we going for? We're at two. It's almost two hours? One and one and one. Two hours, we still got like 300 of you guys here. You guys are crazy, I love it. Very cool, very cool. We cut like half our stuff, so that's good. Ken, we are in one funnel way, right? Ken, all right, welcome back. Let me read this up a little bit. Okay, right now I want to share some of our one funnel way stories. There's so many of these in every single morning, at ClickFunnels, we have a meeting. It starts at nine in the mountain time, where the entire ClickFunnels staff or 430 people all log in, and we have a seven minute meeting. We're gonna go over the scorecards, the main things happening in our business, and then at the very end, we always share a story from some of our community. And there's so many of these amazing stories, and I'm like, man, I want everybody to hear these stories, because I think if people understood what's happening in the community, and how people's lives are being changed, they get more and more excited. So I decided I'm gonna start grabbing some of these every single week that we do this show, and share some of them. So I've got three one funnel way stories to share with you guys today. I may mess up on people's names, I so apologize in advance that happens, but the stories are what's powerful. And if you've got some cool one funnel way stories, please share them in the comments down below, and maybe we'll pick you for next week to tell your story. All right, so the first one is Jockez Hopkins. I'm gonna read the story from him right here. So we said, my business is called Piano in 21 Days. It's an online piano course, and it's a different way to learn piano than most of the approaches out there. It's something that I came up with myself, and it's designed to help regular people learn to play their favorite songs on the piano in as little time as possible. ClickFunnels just made everything easier and more effective. I was able to get rid of three or four services, and just use ClickFunnels. Before ClickFunnels, I probably sold 50 copies of my piano courses, since switching things over around three years ago, I've sold 3,500 copies, quit my job, and now make more money from teaching piano than I did as an electrical engineer. Congratulations to you, that is exciting and amazing, and I love when you can take your passion and your hobbies and turn them into your career. So congratulations to, did I say right, Jockez? Jockez. Jockez, okay. Congratulations, that is amazing, I love your story. All right, up next, this is LongTran. He said, my dream is to travel around the world and become an entrepreneur and a self-made millionaire, and I did it with ClickFunnels. Here's my story. I'm a high school dropout, I barely speak good English, never had good grades in school, but I had a dream at a young age, I wanted to be a self-made millionaire and start an online business, where I can be able to travel around the world and live the freedom life I wanted. That was always on my mind, no matter how hard life got, or how many times I fell in the business, or even when everyone was looking down at me, the one thing I've always had is the motivation and belief in myself that one day I would get there, and that is what actually matters. No matter how dumb you are, or how young you may be, or how old you may be, never give up on yourself, don't let anyone tell you that you cannot do this, as long as you take action, never give up on yourself, that is what matters most, and it's the reason I'm successful today is because I believe in myself and I take action. All right, so congratulations to Long. Take out that two comic club trophy. I love it, if you don't have yours yet, this should be like, I don't know if you guys remember, a couple years ago, Dana Derrick did not get one of these at Funaliki Live, he went home, got a magic marker, and on his wall, he drew a picture, he really lopsided picture doing this, and drew two commas in with a circle, and he said, I'm gonna look at this every single day till I have my award, and hope that you guys are just like long here, and strive for this award, okay, because as much fun as like making million boxes or getting an award, like this award represents so much more, it represents tons of people's lives you've changed because of the products and service you've created. All right, the last one I wanna share with you guys, this one I'm really proud of and really excited for, this is Shemaine Van Gundy, so here's Shemaine, and I'm gonna tell you guys her story. She just said, I believe, do we have fact checkers here? I think this is real, no, she did awesome. So ever since we launched the Two Comic Club, people have been trying to get there the fastest, and there's been a lot of races and people going through, and so I know Shemaine said I'd go a little while ago to get the fastest, I believe at the time, we should make an official award this Sunday afternoon, we have to clock everybody though, but I believe at the time was 47 days, she came in last month and said I'm gonna beat it, and in 21 days she won herself a Two Comic Club award. So congratulations Shemaine, which is exciting. On top of that, another cool thing about her is those of you who were at Funnel Hacking Live last year, we did a big charity auction where this is my mom, my mom made this really cool Funnel Hacker quilt, and we raffled it off for charity for OUR, and Shemaine ended up winning that and helping, I think it was like over 40 kids to get out of slavery, which is amazing, so she's an amazing person, she's giving, she's sharing, she's setting ClickFunnels records, and she's an amazing person, and just grateful for her having her in our community, and she's somebody you guys can all look up to, someone who is killing it, and having a ton of fun, and giving back during the process. Okay, we're to the last segment of the show. Right, am I missing anything? All right, for the last segment, I'm gonna lower this desk down, because I want to. All right, so last night, not last night, I read all of the new influencer advertising laws, you see me here? So I'm not an actual influencer, I'm a marketing nerd, but if you sell something, you have to disclose it, so my sponsor today is Phoenix, Phoenix is actually a company I own equity in, so that I invested in, so there's my disclosure, but this is also these amazing energy drinks, and I'm gonna drink one right now, and we're actually gonna give away somebody one of these, so this is like, it's kind of like five hour energy, except it actually tastes good, and gives you a long energy, there's tons of new tropic stuff in here too, and it tastes like candy. How are we gonna get this away? I remember there was a, oh, I remember, yes. Okay, so you can just like pound these straight, but they're really strong, I put them in water, and it's like drinking Kool-Aid. Anyway. And that's two shots, you should just do half a bottle. Thank you, Melanie. All right, so we're gonna be giving away a box of Phoenix energy to somebody, and I'm gonna use this as a teaching moment as well, so you guys can kind of learn. One of the things I'm really big on is Instagram. How many of you guys use Instagram out there? Now, I love Instagram for a lot of reasons. One of my favorite though is, it gives, of all the platforms, it's the one that gives you the best ability to like tell behind the scenes what's happening in your life. It's the most powerful way to build a relationship with your audience, with the attractive character, and things like that, and so what I actually wanna do, is I wanna get you guys on Instagram if you're not on the internet, okay? So make it really simple, get the Instagram app, let me see. If you guys notice, it's free, download the Instagram app. When you click on it, you're gonna go in there, and what's cool is you can follow a bunch of people, it's like there's David Archeletta, who I'm following, if I scroll down, there's Stephanie Dove, there's all the people I follow, like I have a news feed of their life, which is kinda cool. What's even cooler is my favorite thing is at the top here, these are all these different stories, and this is like literally the reality show of every single person's life that you care about that you're following. And so for me, I post probably, I don't know, 10 to 20 Instagram stories a day, talking about my life, like last night, the wrestling match with my kids, I was posting me with the kids, and there's videos of me going crazy on the sidematch, going nuts, and then coming back and talking about it, and it's really like, if you wanna follow me on this journey, and really get behind the scenes of what's happening, Instagram is where most of the stuff's happening, I wanna get you guys to come over here. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bribe you guys to give you this, so what you have to do right now, is you gotta download Instagram, then you gotta search on my name, those who don't know me yet, my name is Russell Brunson, okay, and you'll see there's me, I can't see this, but there's me, there's a little blue check mark, there's people that keep knocking me off, keep shutting down, make sure it's me with a little blue check mark, that's actually Russell, go over there, and then click on my little face, and click on follow. When you follow that way, you'll see my feeds, pull up in there, and you'll see my reality show, and I'm gonna record them right now for you guys, okay? I want you to go watch the reality show and comment, and that's how you get a chance to win this thing, okay? So I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it Instagram live right now. What's up everybody? I am on Facebook live right now with so much people, and I'm gonna be giving away some of this energy shots. So this energy shots I've been using for the last little while, give me tons of energy as I'm building funnels, things like that, if you wanna free back, all you gotta do is just comment on this video. Comment, I'm gonna pick one person comments, I'm gonna ship you out a box of Phoenix energy, and you can use it while you're building funnels, so it's really simple. For all you guys who are watching at home, all you gotta do is go subscribe to my Instagram channel, watch this video, and then just comment, and I'll look at my comments, and if you're watching this right now, just comment about Russell, I want one, and then we're gonna pick someone randomly, and I'll ship you guys out of a box of Phoenix energy. So that's it, it's pretty simple. All right, peace. That's how it works. So that video's in there now. If you go to Instagram, and click on my little story, so the story's a little round thing on top, click on the story, if you watch it next little bit, you'll see my kids wrestling last night, you'll see me this morning, you'll see a stressing out before this whole show started, and then you'll see that, and just comment on that post, and you'll have a chance, we'll pick one random commenter, and we'll ship you guys out a big old box of Phoenix energy, so you can have more energy while you're building your funnels, and that's kind of the game plan. So, I think that that's kind of it for the day. So I hope you guys enjoyed the show. If you did, I would love to hear your thoughts. We're gonna try to do this more often, and tell us stuff you like. If you like that part was cool, that part was lame, this part was like, let me know whatever it is, I'd love to hear your thoughts, your feedback if you want more of something, want less of something. If you want John to come on here and flex during the show, I could probably talk him into it. Anyway, I also wanna thank all people behind the scenes that have been working on the show. There's tons of people like Leon who's working on the slides back home. Christian's been killing himself, getting everything mapped out, everything. I just had to show up and just talk. They did all the hard work behind the scenes, so grateful for everybody who put in time and energy. I know there's more people on my team as well, but everyone who put in time in this. If you guys liked it, again, let them know down in the comments. Let me know, let everybody know, and I wanna check out these comments. I can look at the comments now. Can I unplug this? Yeah. We'll see what happens. Okay. Bring the comments. I subscribed. Oh, cool. Oh yeah, don't forget, we're still doing the awards. Well, if you subscribe, go subscribe to the podcast, and you can win a chance to win that sign. And it's fun. Okay. A couple of things I'm gonna tell you guys just since the show's kinda over now, we're just hanging out is one of the big reason why we did that is you can kinda, some of you guys can probably tell, is each of those segments was content specific for different platforms. Some of those were videos for Instagram, some were for YouTube, some were for Facebook, some were for just different things. So we were crafting in, some were for our blog, like crafting the content in a way we could repurpose in different spots. The last thing we're probably gonna do here, I don't know if we'll do it live or not, we're gonna do it live, is each of the different videos need like little segment intros of like, like the podcast intro and things like that. So I'm probably gonna record those right now, and then we'll have them. Should we cut it or should we watch? You guys wanna see behind the scenes? Yeah. Anyway, and then we'll be able to use each of those different pieces on different platforms. It's a strategy we're talking about in the Traffic Secrets book that you'll all be reading on May 5th, which is way too far away, but it's coming still soon. So, anyway, Craig says it may yet. I know it's killing me. The good news is though, like right now I'm in the process of rewriting the Dotcom Secrets book and the Expert Secrets book, and all three are coming out on May. It's funny because the Dotcom Secrets book, I thought it was gonna be a quick rewrite. I would say, have any of the words been the same? It's a holding book. Holding book. Yeah, even the, yeah, it's a holding book. So I basically have three books between now and the end of the year. So hopefully that's the secret. Anyway, we'll find out. I still don't let Dotcom Secrets, but May 5th, what I'm hoping we're gonna do is sell a box set and my goal for all of you guys is to everybody get it together and then we like do a book club and we all read through all the books and they're very mean to the end, because they're all, anyway, it's gonna be really cool. So. You really want to see you do the intro to that show. You do? Okay, all right. And Milagros wants you to go to New York, so. I should go to New York? Milagros wants you to go to New York. Really? I love New York. New York's one of my favorite places. Like honestly, all the trips I've ever gone on every time I go to New York, it's like, wow, it's an amazing experience. I don't know what it is. Okay, all right, so. It's a podcast, the first. Podcasts, one's the first. The first, this is mostly just audio. Yeah. Wait, Brandon said something, what? Do I do the other camera? You might have to have your drunk on camera for a little bit, Morgan. Oh. I didn't know what you're doing. We're standing now. Oh, I can see it, I can see it. Yeah. You cut it perfectly. All right, Ken. I can do the podcast one's audio, because that's what's got normally gets some. Should I do that? Yes, go ahead. Okay. Um.

Is it hard times that we're talking about? We're talking more like to get you momentum, get you motivated. I don't know. Momentum, get past the roadblocks or to keep you going. Okay. All right, I know that sometimes entrepreneurs, we are out there trying to change the role. We get stuck against roadblocks and things that are hard. There's ups and there's downs. And I think for most of us, a lot of times we turn to quotes to get us excited. And there are four quotes that I found this week that meant a lot to me during times, when I was struggling times, and I didn't wanna wake up in the morning or times I wanted to go to the next level.

We're gonna tag some down below. Who you know is in the thick of it, who needs some help, who needs that little push over the edge. And I hope these quotes will help you as much as they help me. I told them to do something in the comments. Yeah, part of it is awesome. I suck at that part in case you were wondering. I know that's awesome. I'm learning. Okay, back to the podcast. Would you be out to us for those? No, we don't do out to right now. We do need to make ads. Anyway, that's the start of the day. We need to update all of our ads for that. Oh, we can do the outro on this too. Oh, where's Rizema? Yeah, yeah. What's your favorite quote? Post in the comments down below. Oh my gosh, I'm such a YouTuber now. Yes! Ken. You too, man. Ken.

What would they go to the podcast? So, Christian, are we in one of those first? Are we doing, what are we doing? I don't know where that's living. I don't know where that's living. That's only for the life? We did talk about that way on being just for the life, actually. That's true we did. Am I sure I'll stop with it right now? We're live on YouTube. So. YouTube, they won't worry how to stuff, so. I mean, you could put it on YouTube. I don't think it'll be like, I don't think it'll be big. We could try and see what it does. I don't think it's big. Who would do the podcast subscribe when you're saying? Is that for? Yeah, so call to actions, I don't know. It's in our list here, so if you want to say like, subscribe, tell your friends and family about the podcast, you know, and just insert those maybe at the end. I'm assuming we're gonna record like five. That was like the whole different ads. Okay, we can not separate. That's gonna be scripted out ads, we need to write stuff. Okay, let's see if we can hear. We want to like swipe up, like, swipe with the podcast, you know. Oh yeah, for the podcast, that's it. Actually, yeah, it's a little quick, because these could be swipe up. Give me a stand, Skinny, because you're gonna have to chop the sides. Yeah, why don't you just lay down on the table side? Swipe this way, swipe over. Okay, before we move on, so did you do voice outros for the next podcast will be Annie Grace? So it sounds like you might be that. Right, no, no. It's just a quick at the end of your podcast.

Hey on the next episode, I'm gonna be answering a question from the community. It says now that you run a company worth nearly a billion dollars, do you have to make a concert? Concert, concert. Like a concert, okay. All right. On next episode of the Marketing Secrets podcast, we're gonna be answering a question from the community. The question was now that you run a company worth nearly a billion dollars, do you have to make a concerted effort every day to remain humble, or do you have new challenges that you face each day to, I don't know, tongue twister? Okay. On the next episode of the Marketing Secrets show, we're gonna be answering a question from the community.
