Five, four, three, two, one. The man, Russell. Pay to sell your product. I love this guy. I honestly believe the entrepreneurs are the only people that can actually change this planet. Alright, so we're going to be Jenna Cooching. She runs the Gold Digger podcast. This last year, she destroyed everyone in this contest. She won the Philly Contest hands down. So anyway, she's got an audience that converts really, really well. Yeah, her people love her. My wife was at the dentist yesterday, and the receptionist walked in and said, You know Jenna Cooching, I saw you on her Instagram. You should send her a video. Hello dentist office assistant. It's me. It's like people, like everyone loves her. She's like a great human way better than most people. You say that? Yeah, I can say that for sure. That's true. This is my quote about you. Russell basically came out of the womb doing a sales pitch. And is the founding father of online marketing. He's a personal friend and I'm a student of his work because he's one of the most brilliant Almond men I know and radically influential leader and the knowledge was... Oh, that's so sweet. It's nothing real and the rule will be hard bound and it's a little sneakier, but... Oh! The whole chapter by you basically, so... Thank you. How many options you get? 36,000. Jesus Christ. You said five right now. It's almost 10% of their list. Jenna, that's awesome. This is my guy at Bynu building. We're gonna give him a discount. Hey, we are right now at mastermind.com. If you have no idea what this is, this was an idea that Dean Grasiosi had about two years ago. He told it to Tony Robbins and they decided to partner up on this business teaching people how to start their own education businesses. Their own coaching businesses doing courses, doing masterminds and things like that. I had a chance to hear about it about six months before launch and I told Dean, I'm like, Oh, it would be cool if you had the domain name mastermind.com. We were a little sneaky and went behind the scenes. We found who owned it. We negotiated with them and we got it and gave it to Tony and Dean as a gift. And now it's here on the side of a building, which is pretty crazy and cool. And last year they did the first initial inaugural launch and it became the biggest launch in the history of internet marketing. 20,000 people went through the course and graduated from the course, which is crazy. And it's been a year since it's been opened and now tonight we're reopening it to the public. So Tony and Dean are in there right now planning and preparing and getting ready for the big show tonight. There's over 462,000 people registered. So no pressure, no stress. We're live streaming it. So I hope I don't mess up or trip on stage. That'd be really embarrassing. But come on the journey. Let's go. Jenny, you ready? I'm ready. I am ready. Game time. We're in the house. This is cool. This is pretty sweet. This is massive. Really cool office space. You're a brother. I didn't know you had 30,000 people registered. 36,000. Boom! You can't get the boys to have to get it right now. But you know why? Because while we were all in Fiji and in Vegas they're all like, well you did it this year, Jenny. But don't expect next year. She's like, this is no flu. Originally we were thinking of having all four of us come in. But I thought it might be too busy and we can't get your message and your message. Yeah, I think we should separate. So I think, only because I think what happens is I really want to hear your message from your point of view and I really want to hear Russell playing clean up of like anything we missed. We got this. That'd be perfect. Yeah. I mean it doesn't do great tonight. It's pretty much on Russell. I could screw it up. But just pick up all the stuff we think we missed or work clear on. Or like, oh you guys went way too fast over this. Right? That's cool. Perfect time. We heard a year ago to the very first one of these. It's interesting because this concept was like a startup. It was brand new. No one knew about it. And it was crazy because we were in this little office. There were like 19 people all around one desk going crazy scrambling trying to get all the things done. It became the biggest launch in the history of the internet. And now it's a year later. We're going to be up for, you're up for round two. And it's just really cool to see the people. All these employees here last year happened to know who anybody was a year ago. Now they got hats and they got t-shirts. But last year this time we had 19 people. I know. We had 74. Crazy. It's insane. A lot of scaling. Quick. Scary. And we went from two strategy consultants. Now we have 20. And then there's the coaching division in there too. Welcome to the coaching department. I enjoyed your mastermind.com tour. What did you guys do last year when we did this party? No. We went to the coaching department to know. We've been doing it for like a month. Oh really? Yeah. This is definitely more upscale than last time. Last time we were like, I hope people like this. You know what I mean? How bad is that? Oh yeah. I turned out people like this. That was good. And it's just really cool to see what's happened in a year. If last year is any indication what's going to happen this year. You can imagine how it's going to happen. Going from start to finish, now we've got the fuel to really grow huge. Good to see you. How you doing? Yeah. I'm so self-conscious because it's like, we're not talking to 200,000, 300,000 people. We're talking to one person sitting at a laptop 200,000 times over. And it's like, oh crap. If I'm on stage in front of 5,000 people at FHL, it's like, oh okay. What do I do? Feedback everybody. And it's like, am I too much for just this one person? Anybody to come and watch this tonight? I did not, but I did. Well, if you did, I just need to give security their name. Yeah. Yes, here I'll spell it for you. I don't know if she's going to come or not. I'm going to spell it for her and see if she's still doing it. He's going to sell this. You very careful. Oh my God. Here's how you spell it. Oh my goodness dear, where is it? Her name is Delta. Yeah. Okay. Here we go guys. Come on, teach me your ways. Hey, come on if you want to come. So my profile is actually just testimonial. So my first one is one hell of an awesome guy in New York Times. He's the greatest dancer I've ever seen, MC Ham. MC Ham. I could have said that Michael Jackson said it, but whatever. We're honored to call him friend. I hope we're at Mark Zuckerberg. Good professional pick. Pick up me on stage. I can probably switch that. Well, in certain name here, it looks like we both swiped right. I guess that means we're official Tinder boyfriend and girlfriend. Dot, dot, dot. But just so you know, if we break up, I get to keep the dog and the house. The dog and the house. To which 70% of women respond, no way I get to keep the dog. To which I respond, no way I'll see you in court. If I'm reading this map correctly, Hawaii is the perfect court location. So I'll see you there. And now I'm going on a pretend date to find new pretend girlfriend who I'm trying to take her to. And I'm going to go to Hawaii with her. So what's up, Brian? What's up, Brian? What's going on? We see you again. We're just hanging out all the time. Do this new office as you're saying. You want me to, I mean, I have what Jeremy sent me. I'm sure that you guys went over. Is there anything that you want me to? Just whatever Russell says. Okay, okay. Just click for us every third word. Exactly. Give your link. One thing I think we should do though is some people have, I remember in real estate, I would have a group of 500 people in the room and I'm training all of them and people would raise their hand and say, Hey, there's 500 people in here. There's probably no room for me to even be in this business. Like there's 350 million people in America alone. You couldn't take each other's business, but some people have that thought. So if I forget, might be one of those things. Yeah, we have hundreds of thousands of people on, but this is what makes this industry stronger. Anyway, anything you see like that, you just come in at the end. You're coming out and I want to show you something. Dude, that is killer. You show me 10 conversions that worked on the show. My job, I worked for you. These are everybody who graduated. These are the people who graduated just from last year. So long. Because we built this course to get you through. These are 1100 wins. That role of different niches, they identified 4,300 different niches. I had them tape them all together. So I'm going to unroll it. It goes from here to the sales floor. That is so cool. Jen and I were talking at lunch about it. She said the biggest problem that her people had was your Tony store and you're showing it's so big, they're like, I can't do that. You know what I mean? Yeah, so that's why I'm going to tell my story in a way, just really quick. What I'm going to say is, this is 20 years ago, my life shifted when I paid for it for 25 years ago when I bought this guy's stuff. And it shifted my life so much that I wanted to get in that business. And who the hell was that? Tony was in it for you. He was a monster. He was millions of people. I worked in a collision shop and auto sales and I wanted to help people. And I created a course on how to make money selling used cars. Do you have that course here? Yeah, I think we have it someplace. I have the first one. You should totally show it. If you have the course, the book or whatever, I would totally show it. When I show my potato gun, people flip out. In fact, one of our events, I printed a DVD, potato gun DVD for everyone in the audience and they went nuts. Like showing the beginning. Do we have that course here someplace? We threw all that crap out your... No, it's scary. I think we have to set a couple books. Yeah, where is that? Here it is. This is the greatest. Check this out. Dean, when I first saw Dean's initials, it was his motor millions infomercial and we just found the original course just in time for tonight's big event. Look at this guy. How old are you here? I was 30. If I listened to this, I would cringe. Would you show this? All of it? Million percent. Tony, have you ever seen it? No. I bet you've never seen this before. Tony, I'm gonna surprise you. Check this out after it went through your stuff. Who's this to you? I worked at a car dealership and they're right over the car thing and now I got this and this is how I got my start and info in the knowledge business. So cool. Five different cameras, six different camera angles and trying to cover everything. Working for Dean, you learn to think on your feet. So I have a hard line connected. I have a Wi-Fi connected to a separate ISP and then I have two cellular cards. I mean, if you look at the programmers screen, you can see the activity on that page. That is the matrix. That is people hitting our page. We just got 2,000 more people on YouTube in 60 seconds. Oh, actually. We're at 11,000. Between our list and Opt-In's. We're aiming at 840,000 people. Let me know how excited you are to be here. Let me see what we've got here, who we've got. Asheville North County, this is going too fast. This is amazing. Oh, wow. Okay, I'm going to freak out. There's 70,000 people on it. Crazy. Yeah. Hey, what's your time? Right now, you are part of the single largest online web and training event in the Quizdory of the Internet. Four, three, two, one. Make an ass. Let's go. Whoa. Well, hey, everybody. Thank you and welcome. It's Tony Robbins. Dean Graziosi, what's up? Listen, we have half a million people from over 100 countries that are joining us right now, at least to register. Let's see how many of you show up. But those that are watching right now, welcome. We're very excited and quite thrilled to join us. The chat's out of control. Yeah, it's going, it's difficult because the chat's going so quick. If you look on this side, you can't even type in here. 50 requests to join the group in the last 10 minutes now. Shop and on cars every day. And at night, I created my first course. Look at that. Got a VHS. You might not even know what this is. Anytime he says, Jim Rohn, take a shot. Like Jim Rohn taught these things. Anytime they say millionaire, take a shot. Anytime I wink, take a shot. Anytime we say the self-education industry. Throw it back. I was like, I can wear yoga pants and no one would even ask. Just crush it. You should have seen the chat. It just blew up when she got there. They are in love with Jenna. Jenna's going to actually selling them on the products. She's doing a really good job. Because they don't even think I talk about the industry. They've got them, they've got them open eyes with possibilities. Jenna's specifically selling them on like this and what's products. Amazing. She's been through it twice or third time. I'm coming in to go through the three big reasons why some of them are buying. One is they don't believe in the vehicle. Like being an always broker. Two, they don't believe they can actually do it. And number three, they say some external fear. I don't know how to do it. Like, something to be knocked down on three false beliefs. And hopefully they'll know that. Two years later, you're going to be up here on stage with hey Jenna, saying nobody telling your story. But it's all about enduring long enough to get noticed. Keep doing the thing, keep doing the thing. And so I hope that helps you guys to vote through the thing. I don't know if I can do it. What are the convergence? So right now we're at about 55% full pay. And some of these upsells are from yesterday because I tested a bunch. All right, the offer dropped 15 minutes ago and they just passed $1 in sales. It's five-year sales already. Two grand a pop, so two comic club already. So that's probably one of the fastest, not the fastest ever. All right. Great job, guys. Thank you guys. You did amazing. Thank you. Someone was like, I've never seen Tony that quiet. I was like, oh my goodness. I was listening and taking it all in. I love it. It was good. It was fun to watch. So and then me and Russell are like, okay, so you go. I go, wait, what do we, yeah. Okay, how do we, what do we do? Detective. Yeah. It's good. I think it's good though. I think it's a good flow though. All right, we just got done with the launch. It was crazy. It was stressful. It was hectic. Now we're all tired. Appreciate it. Thank you. Well, compared to any other launch, it's like insanely good. We're 3000 units already. Tony Robbins has left the building. Dean's still in the building, but now we're leaving the building. We have some sushi. We jump on the plane and head back home for Norris birthday party. It starts in like five hours or something like that. Thank you. Thank you.
