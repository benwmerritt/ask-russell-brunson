Whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins. So people who win, especially in today's market, because media has gotten so expensive, are the ones who understand that everything you sell initially, the goal of all this is to do what we call break even. The problem is most people, that's their entire business is like, they have an ad to a ladi page, they sell them something, they had upsell, downsell, and then when all is said and done, they spent $100 in ads, they made $100 back, they broke even or they lost money, like, oh, internet marketing doesn't work, and they kind of walk away from it. Because think about how hard it was back in the day, like, if someone would see this ad, they would have to go and like, send you mail, like send you cash or check or money order in the mail, hoping that you would then send them something back with no recourse if it didn't show up. And so they tested all sorts of things to make it easier. What's up, this is Russell, welcome back to my vault. Today I'm gonna share with you guys both a book, a course, I got some ads to show you. It is the Roth memory course, which was very famous back in the early 1900s. For this, I spent $1,000 on the actual course, $1,011.32 for the course, and it came in the original packaging, which, come on, come on, that's pretty cool. And they got the book for $32.39, and I also bought one of the ads, promoting the Roth memory course, an ad from 1922. And this cool about this ad, it's very hardcore directory response, like this ad would convert today. It says more than $200,000 have paid $5 and $7 for this famous work, but now you can get the original, complete Roth memory course, only $1.98. Mail is couponed in right now. And it has all the directory response elements. Like it's a beautiful, insanely cool ad. I thought it was really cool to kind of tie together the ad with the course and the book. First thing I saw is I saw a bunch of ads for his memory course, right? And then I was like, well, I wanna know what he's teaching then, right? I know a lot of my friends are people who teach memory stuff nowadays. I'm like, you know, they're teaching the same things they were teaching in 1920s. The different was it looked like. So for me, it began like that, right? So I found a bunch of the ads. And so I, on eBay, I'll search like for different, you know, Roth ads, and I'll see what phones pop up and I'll buy all the different ads that are online. It's crazy because there's people literally who just cut up old magazines and sell the ads. I know it seems weird, but apparently people like me buy the old ads. I thought it would be the only one, but it must not be because there's a lot of people who literally just sell cutouts of ads for back in the day. So I started searching for all the Roth ads I could find. Again, this was my favorite one that I was able to get original from. And then from there, I started looking like, what was he selling? This one was the memory course, which was exciting because a lot of times you can find the books, but sometimes courses were really rare back then. People weren't doing courses in the 1920s, right? And so to find like this course, which is in like almost perfect condition, like the box is all beat up, but this is in like just flawless, perfect condition, right? And then after the course, then they went and wrote the book based on the same principles. So for me, it's like, I want to find all the pieces in the funnel, right? If I was to build a funnel off of Roth's business, right? Like here's my front-end ad, I've been running on Facebook and Instagram, right? You would go to the squeeze page, which is the little coupon code right here on the page. From there, they would request a copy of the course for 298, then they may all right, upsell them the book with live coaching calls or whatever it might look like back in the day. But I just like trying to see like, how would I reverse engineer this funnel if I was building it today based on the assets and the courses and the products and the things that they were actually selling and publishing back in 1922. All right, let me walk you through just the way my brain works when I'm creating an offer, right? And the same thing I'm trying to reverse engineer from these old ads. The media from back here in 1920 is the same today, which just is structured differently, right? Back in the day, people focused on radio. Today, it's podcasts. Back then it was TV, now it's YouTube videos, right? But all these things are the same. And so when I see direct mail, when I see magazines become space ads and magazines, you see like the model is very similar to what we're doing today. Okay, so again, if you look at this, I'll kind of map out what this funnel would look like and I'll show you how I would replicate that in today's world, right? So this is the ads. This first part of the thing is the hook, right? It's inside of a magazine, but it's the hook. So the equivalent of the magazine today might be Facebook or Instagram or something, right? And so you got the feed over here and you have all this stuff in Facebook that all of a sudden there's these posts and then all of a sudden you have the ad right here that's boom, got Ross head in there and it's like, here's the big hook and headline, click here for more information, right? And so back here, what you would do to get more information is you would send in this coupon. They tested a lot of ways to get more people to actually like send in for the coupon, right? Because think about how hard it was back in the day. Like if someone would see this ad, they would have to go and like send you mail, like send you cash or check or money order in the mail, hoping that you would then send them something back with no recourse if it didn't show up. And so they tested all sorts of things to make it easier. What they ended up doing, you can notice here is they have the little clip out coupon and it always says cut out the coupon. By having an engagement device or someone that actually do something, it dramatically increased conversions, okay? That's how they made magazines work back in the day. Same thing with direct mail pieces. If you look at the old school direct mail pieces, typically they would come with a sales letter but they would have a coupon that you would have to literally cut it out and mail it back in with your check or your money order. And by having that engagement device where someone was doing something, it increased the conversion to people actually doing the step. Like it's just fascinating the psychology behind that, right? As digital marketers, our job is to create what's called consistency, commitment and consistency. I'm trying to get people to commit to something and to be consistent. When you get somebody into a funnel, what you're trying to do is like giving them to make a commitment and then another commitment and another commitment. Each commitment gets a little bit bigger, a little bit bigger, a little bit bigger until you ask for the big commitment which is like a sale or then the upsell, then the next thing, right? It all starts beginning with a very small commitment. So this one, small commitment is cut this out and mail it back with the $1.98 to get this course in the mail, right? For us, the equivalent would be like, okay, you see the ad, click here, give me your email address and I'm gonna send you a free report, right? So it comes over here and you end up on a landing page, right? And maybe it's got the rest of this, right? It's got the picture of Roth here, it's got the rest of the copy talking about it's like, hey, put your name, email address in, I'm gonna send you a copy of the report. So what would happen back in the day? I don't know exactly how Roth structured it, but someone would request the free kit or for the discount low ticket product, they would send this out there along with the sales letter, right? So what we do is we replicate that today where someone puts the name, email address in and then you give them a report, a free video or free report. And typically the free video or the free report is literally the sales mechanism to sell the next thing, right? A lot of times on my landing page, is I'll give a free video, my hate free video, free webinar, free report and all that is they go to the next page and then at the top of the page there is a play button where they watch a video, that's the free video they requested. In that video, I tell them whatever I told them I was gonna do on the landing page and then from there I upsell them, I sell them the next product. That's kinda how the structure works, like it's literally the exact same thing people are doing through magazines and direct mail back in the day, we're just kinda replicating it on the online version. So we go digital ad to a landing page, they request more information, we take them to that page where they get the video, they get the report whatever it is, at the end of that we sell them the next thing, right? And then from there obviously we'd have upsells and downsells and things like that. The first part of the funnel, right? The first step. But then what happens is, this comes back to my mentor Dan Kennedy, he always says whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins. So people who win, especially in today's market because media's gotten so expensive are the ones who understand that everything you sell initially, the goal of all this is to do what we call break even. The problem is most people, that's their entire business is like, they have an ad to a landing page, they sell them something, they had upsell, downsell, and then when all is said and done, they spent $100 in ads, they made $100 back and they broke even or they lost money, they're like, oh, internet marketing doesn't work and they kind of walk away from it. Think about how much harder it was for these guys back in the day. Like they had to pay for the ad in the magazine, had to show up, they had to wait six weeks, two months, three months for something to get it, and sit on their counter, they'd be flipping through the magazine, six weeks later to finally see it, cut it out. Think about how long the delay was for these guys to wait to get stuff back. We don't have that, we can get response a lot faster, right? From the ad boom to the landing page, to sales page, the upsell, but the problem is that media is so much more expensive nowadays, right? So you figure you break even and then the next thing, this is where you start making money. So if I was Roth, what I would do is I would sell this course, we'd come with a sales letter and the sales letter would basically be the thing selling whatever it's next, like what's the next thing, okay? Cause that's where you're gonna actually make your money is on the next thing, right? Again, whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins. The funnel number two in your process is where most of the money comes. In my business, the same way, I sell my books, right? And I don't actually make any money on my books, when people read my books, right? They go through this first process. Our job is to break even, like for example, right now it costs me $30 to $40 on Facebook ads to sell one copy of the dot com secrets book. What I sell for free, they cover shipping handling, right? So you make, oh, so you're spending $40, you only make $10 back, but with that, you gotta print the book and ship it. So you make like literally spending $40 and you're losing all that money. How is this a real business, right? Well, the reasons, cause that's the reason we read the book. Then on the backside on funnel number two, I sell them access to my software, ClickFunnels. Okay, to get in ClickFunnels, they start paying $97 a month to have access to build funnels. From there we upsell people into our coaching programs. We move them from funnel, one funnel to the next, to the next and we keep taking that relationship and growing it over time. And that's the exact same way that Roth, that all the early marketers would have to do as well. Cause they gotta spend money on the ads. As I'm buying these old marketers, it's so fun and so fascinating for me to see it. Cause they had to do it in such a harder, like took longer, it was more expensive, it was harder. And we can take those same principles and replicate them and get things done in hours that take them months to do. And that's the power of digital marketing and sales funnels today. All right, if you guys would like to see a copy of the Roth's ad printed it in the show notes, all you gotta do, click link down below, go to the description and you'll have a copy of this. If I can find any of the Roth ads, I will put them in the file as well. But this is again, one of my favorite ones. That way you can see an example of what really good, copyrighting, really good advertising looks like. And you guys can model something similar for whatever product or service that you are gonna sell. Other than that, I hope you guys enjoyed this video. Hope you learned a lot and we'll see you guys on the next video.
