What's up everybody it's Russell Brunson. Welcome to the Marketing Secrets Podcast. Anyway, hope you guys are amazing today. If you've read Expert Secrets, if you haven't you're in single, go buy it. I spent a decade of my life learning this stuff to give it to you for free. But if you have, ready, you remember they talk about, excuse me initially, there's three markets. There's health, wealth and relationships, right? And every time we share the people like, no, there's other things, like what about this? Like what about razors? And he actually brought that up as a thing, like razors. Like why do people buy razors? Like what's the reason? And you think about like, they're shaming because like, oh, I want to look good, so I can get a girl. Relationships, right? So it's in the relationship market. Like it works for everything. It fits somewhere in those things, right? That's the core markets, right? And if you think about like back in the day, whoever was first in the core market, it's probably one dude, right? The taught health. And he was like the weight loss guy and everyone gave him money because he was amazing. And then someone else was like, wait a minute, I don't know how to lose weight too. Maybe I should jump into health. And they jumped in and then this blue ocean of a market became this red, bloody ocean with tons of people. And so then the evolution of markets started happening. So we got health, wealth and relationships and they evolved to a niche or a sub market, excuse me, inside of wealth. It's not just like I'm teaching to become wealthy. There's like these sub markets. Like, well, there's real estate you can be used to become wealthy there is internet marketing become wealthy, there's stocks, there's, and there's all these sub markets within there, right? Initially whoever broke out in the sub market, like blue ocean, boom, all the money started happening. But then some of the guys like, well, I know stocks too. Maybe I should jump in and teach this stuff. Maybe I should create software that does this or whatever, right? And so those red oceans start becoming, or excuse me, those blue oceans start becoming bloody and red again and it gets harder and harder and more competition. And so that's the market that you guys are in today. And so you can come in and jump into red ocean. The problem is that you're competing for people's attention for the same kind of thing. And it's just as difficult. And so the next phase of that is then coming down to the third level, which is the niches. You develop your own, you create your own niche. And I purposely don't say don't find your own niche because finding your niche means you're jumping into a red ocean, but you're developing, you're creating your own niche within this ecosystem, right? One thing he said that was so cool and I want to come back. He said, your niche needs to come out of a red, bloody ocean. So he says, if you don't know what your red ocean is that you are, that you are breaking out of, then you're not doing it right. Like you didn't pick the right thing. So for example, let's say it's this example of relationships, you know, a health, wealth and relationships, relationships, shaving, the shaving now is this bloody thing, right? There's all these thousands of people selling shavers and shavers and stuff. And so like you need to know, like that's the bloody market. And then your goal as you're building your business is to look at that bloody red market and then you're gonna be actually throwing rocks and then throwing stones at them. This is how you separate and become this unique different thing. So if you're in the shaving market and you're looking like, man, this is a bloody market, how do I create something new? Create a new niche that gives me the ability to throw rocks at the red, the red, bloody ocean. Think about this, like I've seen this in the last year, right? With stocks, like, so there's wealth, right? And then inside of wealth, there's like the stock markets. And then inside of stock now, there's this magic thing that's become a sex exciting called cryptos, right? So why, like cryptos, people have crypto offers, have to go back to the red, bloody ocean of stock, investing, things like that. And then to throw rocks at the current view, like the red ocean that everyone else is in that they're fighting in, you have to throw rocks at it. And that's what separates you and creates your blue ocean. Now cryptos become bloody, right? So now it's like, if cryptos is a bloody red ocean, like what is the thing that I got that I can look back at that, the crypto red ocean, and I can throw rocks at this, like everyone's doing cryptos this way, and this is wrong, this is bad, this is, and you're throwing rocks at it, and then boom, that creates the separation for, boom, your new blue ocean. So if you've got a business right now, and I was actually like, well, which one's the market you're in? Health, wealth, relationships, you gotta tell me that. Number two, then from there, what's the market you're in? I'm in internet marketing, I'm in stocks, I'm in real estate, I'm in whatever, okay? You figure out that, then it's like, okay, now you figure that out, what are you doing to throw rocks at that to make separation to create your blue ocean? You guys getting this? Does this make sense to you guys? Hope that helps. Like I said, it was super cool, I loved it. There should be more, like so much more gold, he was dropping in there, it was amazing. But yeah, it was really cool to see someone else teach a lot of your principles through a different lens. Like, oh, so fascinating. So I was like, I told Matt, I was like, I enjoy you teaching a lot better than I've ever taught it, so that's awesome. It'll help me help you guys appreciate you all. And if you got anything from this, please go to iTunes, leave a comment, and or share this with your friends, family members, and other people who you think this would help.
