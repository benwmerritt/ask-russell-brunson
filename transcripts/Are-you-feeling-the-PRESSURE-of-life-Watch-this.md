What do you mean we're not going to prom? It is the most important night of high school! I know, but I have states that... I don't care! What is wrong with you, Russell? Everyone is going! Have you ever tried to do it all, but then have it backfire in your face? In high school wrestling is my passion. But I also want to do the things that normal high schoolers were doing. Hey Russell, a bunch of us are going to the mall. You want to come? Sorry guys, I practice. Okay. Russell? Can we go out tonight? I got that big wrestling tournament coming up. Maybe next weekend? Why don't we stay inside and we can watch my wrestling tape? And I'll explain my moves to you. Trying to juggle wrestling with a girlfriend... ...didn't go so well. We all feel this pressure to be well balanced, to put an equal focus on everything. But sometimes when you're working towards a goal, you have to be radically imbalanced. I probably shouldn't have been dating while I was so focused on wrestling. But I also don't regret being imbalanced. That focus allowed me to get a college scholarship and all the wonderful experiences that I had there. When I started college, I moved into the dorms with a whole bunch of other wrestlers. So we had a apartment with five other wrestlers besides myself. When we get done wrestling, we were always trying to figure out who the cute girls we could hang out with. And there was an apartment with some really cute girls in it. I think because I wasn't trying to find a relationship, I was more natural and Clint and I really got along. And it wasn't until one day her roommate kind of pulled me aside and said, You know that she likes you, right? Seriously? Yeah, she's not into Joey at all. Send to you. At a time, I was like, oh my gosh, that's crazy. But I dated someone who's older than me. How do I impress someone who's older than me? And so I hadn't had a ton of experience asking older women on dates. And so I did what I knew. Dude, are you sure this is how you want to ask her out? Oh yeah. This is how I asked out every girl in high school. I had toilet paper and toilet paper in a room and we shredded up newspaper and put it all over the room and just made a huge mess. Oh, don't forget the candy sign. And it's kind of embarrassing looking back on it now, but I made a candy bar poster, which basically is a big poster where you glue candy bars in for different phrases. So I said, dear sweetheart, you put sweethearts in there. And then what do you think about going on a date and have some dates there with a junior mint like me? And I hope you don't snicker. So embarrassing to be documented. A day or two later, I got knocked on the door and I opened the door and there was a poster there and I opened the poster. There was a poster of Britney Spears with Colette's face cut out and had her face on where Britney Spears' face was. And basically said, yes, I'd love to go out on this date. And so that's how we got our very first date. Hi. I was in the neighborhood. But when I met Colette, I knew that I'd met the girl that wanted to marry me. So while wrestling was still my passion, I made sure that all my free time was spent trying to win her over. By shifting that radical balance away from wrestling for a time, it allowed our love to blossom in a way that it couldn't have otherwise. Radical imbalance was going after one thing with all of your heart. It worked out for me and Colette. After Colette and I got married, things shifted a little bit, but obviously wrestling was still a huge passion for me. It was pain for school and so because of that we knew it was still something with a big priority. Around this time, I was trying to come away for a tournament. So winning would be the only thing that I stayed hungry for. Are you sure you don't want me? No, no. I'm good. Radical imbalance isn't impossible without making sacrifices. But you have to decide what can I cultivate now so I can continue to bloom when I move on to other things. When we started ClickFunnels, that was another major time of radical imbalance. I saw the light on. I figured it had to still be up. I brought you some cocoa. Thanks honey. I'm sorry for these long nights. And around this time, I was pulling late nights to catch up on coffee for the funnel. I know. Just come to bed when you can, okay? I was going to bed around 4am every morning to keep ClickFunnels up and running. My partner Todd would take over when I got to bed. So we were working around the clock to keep ClickFunnels successful. I was missing out on some major family moments, but the work I was doing was for my family. When my twins started wrestling, I had to shift my time at work so I could coach them at practice. So that also meant that I had to find those work hours somewhere early in the morning or late at night. But the extra time I put in at night, I could manage to take the extra time for my kids. Here we go. That fellas, it's a nice job. I got to lock up. Can we get a picture though? Yeah, no problem. Alright. If you want to create something great, you have to be imbalanced for a while. Then when you've achieved your goal is you can come back and enjoy the fruit. So leave behind the guilt that you feel. Remember, imbalanced is just for a little while. Allow yourself to go there and create the success that you deserve. Thank you. I've been through changes all of my life. Started from zero with nothing behind. Feels so right. This feels so right.
