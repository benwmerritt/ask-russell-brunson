What are you gonna do with all the money at 13 years old? Honestly, probably reinvest it because then you have so much more money instead of blowing it all then. Like there's nothing like I really need. Like I don't really need a Rolex or a Lamborghini that I can't drive. So the first time I kind of ever saw this person or heard of them, I started seeing this person popping into my Facebook feed and Instagram in different places. I saw comments from this person. So I kind of knew they knew what they were talking about, but I didn't know anything else about them until a little while later. And remember, I think the first time I've been Dave, and they said, dude, there's this kid in our funnel hacking community. He's like he's 11 years old. Dude, he knows more about funnels than than I think anybody else I've met. And I'm like, are you serious? And then I met Caleb Maddox and Caleb's like, dude, this guy is working with us. He's literally like the little mini Russell Brunson like this dude is like you. But he's 11 and 12 and he's building funnels and the guy's amazing. And I was like, I keep hearing about him. I need to meet him. And so I had a chance to meet him the very first time. It was right when we first started talking about this event and I remember pulling him aside. And he was the very first person I asked to speak. I said, Hey, I'm thinking about doing this event with kids and families and stuff. And if I do it, would you be willing to speak? And he said, yes. So if you guys don't stand up and put your hands together for Noah Litz. So first off, how old are you actually? People keep asking me 13, 13. So the same age as my twin or so. I saw my kids. I was like, dude, you guys are paying for your own stuff now. Noah's killing it. No. All right. First off, I would love to hear, tell us your backstory about how you kind of got into, because there wasn't, you can just jump into funnels right? And it's like, what, where did it start? And why did you come on this journey to kind of figure some of this stuff out? So my now friend Caleb Maddox, he's like, dude, you seriously should read dot com secrets. Like, I think you would love funnels. So I'm like, all right, I'm going to read it. So I picked up the book. It turns out my dad already had it. He just never read it. So. And like, I'm supposed to go to bed and I like was so enticed in this book. And I look up and it's like midnight. I'm like, oh shoot. But I couldn't stop thinking about all these funnels. Like I had so many ideas. First, I wanted to do a stock image site with funnels. And then I wanted to, I just had so many ideas floating through my mind. At the time I was doing some like web design for people because I like, I was interested in that. So I had a couple of those gigs. I thought, I wonder if I could use a funnel to sell my web design stuff. But I'm like, I can niche down. So I decided to go with the political campaign market. So I went with that market. What are you doing about politics? So I thought, all right, I'll make, I'll make these websites for these politicians. They'll love them. And so the corrupt politicians are the good ones that you focus on. Both. Whoever pays the bills. So I'm like, political campaign. This is the thing I'm going to hit two comic flip tomorrow with political campaigns. But I didn't want to use click funnels at first. So I said, why not? I thought it was too expensive. I'm like looking at all these options. And eventually I'm like, why not just use click funnels? So I got the trial. I'm like, oh my gosh, this is so much better than all these other things. And I like started poking around, creating a bunch of funnels for different stuff. Dog food, I think. I saw your toilet paper funnel. So I made a toilet paper funnel that was exactly like it, like modeling like pixel by pixel, just like getting good into editor. I feel like I was sitting down at a computer for probably six hours straight, messing with click funnel, seeing what it could do and from where I was hooked. So awesome. How did you learn all this stuff? Honestly, most of it was from your books. The books? Yeah. I like watch like every funnel hacker TV episode, like all of your training. I studied some of our direct response marketers like Dan Kennedy, etc. But honestly, at the time I was just like, this is boring. Russell's interesting. So yeah, I mainly it was from you actually. When did you kind of decide like I'm going to build funnels, you know, for Caleb, obviously, but other people like, what was the reason why you kind of made that decision? In about June of 2018, I started my own agency. And at the time, I didn't really know how to run an agency. So I was like kind of doing everything myself. Like I was getting clients, but like I wasn't able to like manage all the clients because I had no idea what the heck I was doing. Because like I knew marketing, but I didn't know how to manage clients. So I was getting all these clients like with my funnel. I was closing them on the phone, whatever. But awesome. You're 12, you're you're doing funnels. That's great. And they like saw some of my work. But then it was like, I had so much on my plate that I had no idea like how to manage it, where who to do first, etc. Yeah. At the same time, I'm still trying to get more clients because I'm a marketer. And so like I have more clients coming in, but yeah, I'm not able to handle my current clients. So like my brain was like totally overwhelmed. I was working like 15 hours a day at 12. Did you skip school? Or did you stay drop out? Summer at that point. Oh, it's good. Summer time. But yeah, so eventually, like I kind of started to figure things out. That was probably a couple of months later and I like got it toned down. I like like found like an assistant to help out with some stuff. But yeah, should have done that sooner. I think of my own assistant for a long time. I'm jealous. So let me ask you then and now, like how much do you just so people get a perspective of like the value of this? Like how much do you charge somebody to build a funnel for them? Honestly, like right now I'm not really in the agency business just because like, like I still work with Caleb a bunch. But like if someone wanted to work with me, I honestly would like probably only work with them if I got a certain amount of equity in the business. He's negotiating equity already. I love it. Case one thing. This is something that super impressed me first about you. When the first interactions mean you had somehow you got me on Vox or which I don't know how you figured out my secret back. My secret Vox or handle. Cause it's top secret as you know, but somehow you figured that out and you messaged me and you're like, Hey, it was one of the funnels that I was doing or something and you fix a bunch of stuff for me. Like, Oh, you messed up here, here, here. I changed these things and you sent it to me. You're like, no strings attached. Just wanted to help. Do you remember that? Yeah, I do. And you know, you know, a couple of times and just, just giving. And this is the reason I bring this up because most people come out when they start any business. And the first thing I do is like, how do I close them and how do I sell somebody? And you've come out from such an opposite direction of like, how can I like help other people and then the business just, just comes. You want to talk about some of your philosophies on that? I'm a big believer in the dream 100. I think you can dream 100 someone beyond being your affiliate. Hence the United States right now. He's been working me for years. But honestly, like, I feel like if you provide value and you show what you're able to provide, like with no strings attached, people will see what you're capable of. It's also like, if you have five people trying to pitch you on window cleaning and, and one person walks up to your house and says, Hey, I know you're probably getting bombarded with everyone trying to pitch you on window cleaning. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to clean this window right here. See if it looks good. If it doesn't, that's fine. If it does, how about I cleaned the rest of your windows, you know, just providing value to first to show you that you're the real deal. Cause like, I know you, you get thousands of messages a week. Like, you know, Melanie probably keeps most of them from you. But like, I needed to get past like the gatekeeper. I needed to get past Melanie. Like I needed to get to you. So I wanted to provide some genuine value. And I do that with a lot of people. Like, um, when like, I wanted to get on Dave's podcast. I first built a new funnel for funnel hacker radio. And I sent that over to him and then I got on his podcast. So good. He's leveraging your funnel skills. Yeah. Give her a round of applause. It's amazing. So outside of the roadblock of you got started getting so much business that you were kind of overwhelmed with any other roadblocks you kind of hit in this journey. Um, yeah, trying to do it all myself. Like kind of the same thing there. Um, I feel like I've always done either too much myself or not enough myself. Um, and I've been getting better at that now, but like after that happened, I was like, I'm gonna be as hands off as possible. And then everything started to go downhill. I'm like, Oh shoot, I still need to be hands on like not to the four hour work week yet. You know, so like just the right balance and also like knowing like what's really needed. Like 80, 20 rule all comes down to that because there's a lot of things that like I did just cause like they were cool, like little tweets or whatever, but like they really didn't do anything in the end. And it took so much of my time and resources and whatnot. And like really just sticking to the fundamentals and what's like really works. It's awesome. All right. So right now in this room, we've got a whole bunch of kids. Some of them, this is like their first time they've ever learned about funnels and all these kinds of things. They don't have businesses yet or products or ideas or anything. There's kind of here, maybe their parents drug them here and like must be coming entrepreneur, listen to Russell. Um, if they really want to get into this and learn it, like what would be the process? Is it reading the books versus the jumping a click funnel is like, what would you, what would you coach them through? If you were asking me, like, how do I start doing what you're doing? Well, the fact that we're at this event is a great start. This is an awesome event. Beyond that, um, I would read all three of the books and then honestly, what I do is I would find a website or a funnel and I would just start creating it and click funnels, like trying and then I'd like read the help docs. And that was like a super fast way to learn, like funnel building, just modeling, like pixel by pixel, not actually launching it, but just like as a way to get better at the funnel building aspect and just like finding what you're really passionate about. Like if you don't like driving traffic, don't drive traffic. Find someone else to drive traffic. But if you love doing the funnel aspect, you know, do the funnel aspect. So like finding what you're passionate about, because otherwise you'll just end up footing. That's one thing I want to kind of stress to all you guys is we're going through this, like we're giving you guys the framework of like the entire business. But if you look at click phones, for example, like we do all this stuff, but there's 340 people who work for me. There's like one person that specializes in each individual thing. So I think what Noah senior is so powerful, like find the piece that you resonate with. You're like, I love the story stuff. I want to tell stories like crazy. You can make a full time income like telling your own story or other people's stories. If you love moving things, the click funnels, I love the traffic dream 100 or any of the pieces, each individual piece. There's a whole career in there for you. Just becoming amazing that. And I know first like someone, I know you mentioned this at FHL that like just writes emails, like so popper and Seinfeld sequences and makes like a fortune. Like if you want to like do agency type things and you want to niche down, like that's entirely possible as well. Okay. So most kids your age are playing Fortnite. They are doing Minecraft. They are watching other people play video games. Do you spend any time doing that or you spend your time on other things? No, I don't really do any of that. Sometimes when I'm like stuck on something, trying to think of something, I will like watch Netflix or something like when trying to figure that out. I'm trying to create a better balance there. But yeah, I don't really play any video games or anything like that. You play the video game of funnels, right? Yeah. For all the kids out there, just so you guys know, funnels are kind of like video games, but the end of it, like, you know, video games, you like win fake money. Yeah. You're going to keep this money and put it in your pocket and buy cool stuff, right? Exactly. Much more fun. That's awesome. All right, I got one more question for you. And this is, I know that you talked about Caleb hit the two comic club. I know that's a goal for you as well. So when you hit two comic club and the money stuff's coming in for you, like, what are you going to do with all the money at 13 years old? Honestly, probably reinvest it into ads and, you know, additional infrastructure. Because then you have so much more money instead of blowing it all then. Like, there's nothing like I really need. Like, I don't really need a Rolex or a Lamborghini that I can't drive. So invest it and then probably give some of it away. That's awesome. It feels good to get money away. That's awesome. Very cool. Okay. So for all the kids and all the parents, what other advice do you have for them while you're here, whether you've got their ears? Honestly, like stick to the framework, like, make your own ideas in there. But like stick to the framework, do what Russell says is cliche as it may sound. Like he knows he's had years and years of experience. You guys are here in two comic club acts like a great resource. So just stick to the framework. Very cool. All right. Let's give Noah a huge round of applause.
