I was going hard, I was launching new products every day, I was doing all sorts of stuff. I started having some success, I was making some more money, then I launched the next thing, and the next thing, I started building companies, I started hiring employees, I started building, growing, growing, but it forced me to run away. I'm running away from something. What's up? This is Russell Brunson, and I am actually coming to you today from inside of my wrestling room here at my house, and you may be wondering, why are we talking here inside the wrestling room? And I'll explain here in a minute. But before I do, I want to talk about, do you know why you do what you do? Why are you driven to do the thing that you're trying to accomplish in life? It could be anything. It could be sports, athletics, it could be business, it could be entrepreneurship, it could be something, but do you know why you want to do what you do? That's the question I want to kind of lead out with today, and then we're going to talk about that from a bunch of different angles. A lot of you guys know I'm obsessed with the Point Hill, and if you read in the Point Hill, basically everything he's ever published, from the Law of Success, to Thinking of Rich, to How to Raise Your Own Sour, and one of the things he leads with, first law success actually, is always having a definite purpose. What is the thing you actually want to do? Do you know exactly what it is? And now when the devil talks about it, only 2% of society of people know what they want to do. They actually have a direction and a thing that they're moving towards. Everybody else is just drifting and wandering around and hoping someday something happy bumps into them, right? Whereas only 2% of people have this driven gene, where they're like, this is what I'm doing, this is where I'm moving towards, this is what I want, and they know what it is, right? Earl Nightingale talks about this in The Stranger's Secret. A man without a goal is like a ship without a rudder. He doesn't know where he's going. He then belongs to that 95% that he's just living day by day, month after month, like a starfish, right? And a meaboo. But by having that rudder which points you in direction, it can get you anywhere you want to go across the whole world, right? And there's the power of having that purpose, like a definite purpose of what you're doing, what you're trying to achieve, knowing exactly what it is. So I'll tell you the story here about this wrestling room. So if you know my background, I wrestled in high school growing up, I was a state champion. I took third in state my senior year, but that loss drove me to have to figure out how am I gonna be six? I needed to prove myself. That wasn't just an okay wrestler one state once, but I was something special. And so for next three months of my life, I was working out seven hours a day trying to get to the next level, because national tournament was a couple months later. Went to the national tournament. To be at that national tournament, you had to be a senior and you had to be a state champion. And I think I had 63 guys in my weight class, multiple, two, and three, and four times state champs. And I came through and I ended up taking second place in the nation. I beat all the other state champs. I proved myself that I was something special, right? Then from there, I went and wrestled BYU for a year. They cut the wrestling program after they went on a mission for the Mormon church for two years. I was knocking doors in New Jersey, having the time of my life. And I came home, I wrestled at Boise State. So my passion, my love, I still my favorite thing of all time I've ever done is wrestling, by far. Everything else is like a close second. In fact, people have asked me before about business. I was like, I would give a business in a heartbeat if I could go back and start wrestling and competing again. Like there's no way. You make so much money. Like no, you don't understand. That feeling and getting my hand raised, like that trumps everything. The closest I've gotten to feeling something similar to that is like in an event when you get a table rush, you get 100 people running in the back of the room. Like that's the closest, but it's not, it's not better. So I love wrestling. It's my favorite thing. Do a great behind me. This picture, that painting, is actually a painting on the wall. It's kind of hard to see exactly. That's my face right there. That's my very last match I ever wrestled in college. I actually had to have lost in that match and that was the end of my career. And we're sitting there on the side of that like, now what? That was all, like that's, huh. And it was over. And I didn't get the national tournament. I didn't do anything. It was just, it was one of the things that was really hard for me. And so, I don't know about you guys, but you know how you spent your entire life chasing a dream. And then it's gone. Like that's where a lot of people go into depression because they missed the shot. Back then I had somebody, I mean, while they messaged me today, I'm gonna pull my phone. Said Russell, your ability to not dwell on the past is one of the things I admire most about you. And I was like, no. And then I centered the screenshot from the lion king. Wow. Geez, what was that for? It doesn't matter. It's in the past. Yeah, but it still hurts. Oh yes, the past can't hurt. But the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it. Ah, you see? They always say like, depression comes from thinking about the past, anxiety comes about thinking about the future. So for me, it's like, I don't think, I don't dwell on the past. And I think if I would have dwell on the past, like I would have gone into depression or something. It was hard to spend a decade or more of your life on a goal and then not hit it. And there's nothing else you can do. It's like, it's over. The term is done, like, that's it. And then luckily, I had been starting with my own, my business at the time. And I was like, okay, I had had some success. I had made a little bit of money. You have to know, like, this was actually a real thing. And so I transitioned my focus to business. I started running. I started sprinting. I was going hard. I was launching new products every day. I was doing all sorts of stuff. You know, I started having some success. I'm making some more money. Then I launched the next thing. And the next thing I started building companies, I started hiring employees, I started building, growing, growing. I mean, Todd Dickerson, we worked together for a couple of years, launching different funnels and webinars and some things online. And eventually we had the idea for ClickFunnels, boom, we built ClickFunnels and it takes off. And it takes off in about two years. And it taking off, like, I mean, I've had a lot of successes. The first one was just like, this is crazy. We're making money like we've never dreamt of before, right? It would help people like crazy. It was just like, it was such a cool, it was a cool thing. It's about two years into the business and when we decided, my wife and I, we lived in a nice house. But like, well, let's get the dream house, the house we're gonna live in forever. The one I wanna die in, right? And so we started the journey trying to find the house. And after a while we found this house. This is an external garage. But when we found this house, a couple of things we know. Number one is like, it's on five acres, there's a whole bunch of mature trees that wrap the whole yard. So like, it would take 20 years to get trees like this, right? And then there was this room right here, which was this external garage. And I saw this, I was like, this is my restaurant. This is it. And so before we bought the house, I literally snuck in one night. I probably shouldn't say it, but I snuck in to measure out the rooms. Like, how big I needed to get wrestling mats. You look on the other side over here, I've got full weight room, whole bunch of other cool stuff. I get a whole thing lined up. And then Rob's Decadas, who's been my favorite designers of all time, do you wanna come paint the walls? And so like, the second we closed on the house, the next day Rob showed up to start painting. And then the mat showed up like a week later. And then the weightlifting, like everything's coordinated to the tea. And my wife's like, where are these people cut? Like, you didn't help me move into the house. She didn't have planned anything in the house. Like, I was like, well, this is my, a man gave this is my dream. This is like what I want was this wrestling room. So remember, we get it, we start putting it all together, getting things set up, getting the painting down, getting the mats down, getting the weight equipment in, everything was happening. And then we finally get it all done. And I called my friend, BJ Wright, who he wrestled in Nebraska. I'm a really good wrestler. And I was like, dude, the wrestling was done. Come on over, so he came over. We go and laced up our shoes and came in here and we wrestled. We take for granted. Like, I have not worked out like wrestling shape for a decade and a half, right? Like I'm out of shape. We come here and we just beat on each other, we're wrestling and having so much fun for about an hour, it's going as hard as we can. And then finally we lay there and we're just dead on the mat, just like no breath, no energy, nothing. We're just laying here on the mat. I had the weirdest feeling. It was a feeling of just like, like first time, I'd been chasing something for like, I don't know, over a decade after my wrestling career. I was chasing something, I don't know what it was. And that moment I sat there with B.G. and I said, dude, this is what I was chasing. I didn't know it, but this feeling, people are coming to be able to wrestle again. Like, that's all I actually wanted. I was trying to get this feeling through all these, through business, through making money, through all sorts of stuff where I just wanted to wrestle again. When you hear me or Napoleon Hill or something talk about definite purpose, right? Like what is your definite purpose? So often the first thing we do is like, here's the thing, the financial goal, one-on-one estate title, or we pick a goal of achievement, right? Like what's the thing I want to achieve? Which is good, I think, I still believe in that. I still think that it's like, it gives life, like color and excitement and like a journey we're going on, like I love achievement. But what's interesting is like, like rarely is the achievement the thing that makes you happy. Like the thing that makes you happy is different. And if you read Expert Seekers and talk about this, like when we tell a story to our audience, we try to get our audience to move, right? It typically happens is we'll tell the audience, like here's what I wanted to do. I wanted to lose weight, to make money. If we pick this journey of achievement we wanted, right? And that's where most people stop, by the way. You look at the great persuaders and the great people who are good at building connection, rapport with an audience. They don't just talk about the achievement that they wanted. They do talk about that, because they have to set that goal. This is also the thing consciously that the client or the person is thinking about as well, like, oh, I also want to make a million dollars. I also want to, whatever, right? So they have the same journey of achievement that they want. But the best persuaders, the best storytellers, they don't talk about what they want. They start figuring out the why. They figure out what is the inner journey of something that's actually going on. Journey of transformation. Like, what do they actually want? And so in the Expert Seekers book, I talk about this. I have to go through this question, like, what do you want? Like, I want to make a million dollars. Why? Well, because then I'll feel like, you know, I succeeded. Cool, why do you want that? I would start going, like, did that levels of deep why? Why do you want that? Like, well, I want to succeed, because right now I don't feel like I'm succeed. I'm struggling in life, right? Like, everything I've tried has been a failure. And I feel like if I had that, that I'd be successful. Like, oh, cool. Why do you think that would change anything? Well, you know, the reality is last week I came home and my wife was upset about football, right? And I feel like if I had this, then she'd be proud of me. But why does that matter? Why does that matter? You want why? Why do you dig deep, seven, eight, nine, 10 levels deep? And eventually is when the real reason why it comes out. The real reason which is, you know, whatever it might be, it could be like, I just want to impress my dad. I want my wife to love him more. I want my kids to respect me. Like, that's the real reason, right? Like, if I went back to myself after I got done wrestling, I lose at the Pac-10 tournament. I don't get to fulfill my dreams. And I'm running from that. I'm running from this pain, right? Trying to get away from this pain. I don't want this pain. I want it gone. I start running towards something, right? Like that's causing me so much pain. It's forcing me to run forward. I'm running away from something. What if I just wouldn't directly say, like, I just miss wrestling? Okay, cool. Let's figure out a time where once a week, you're gonna go into a high school room wrestler. You're gonna go wrestling college, college kids. You're gonna, but if you got something like that, I probably could take so much pressure off my back. As opposed to just going directly and doing that. I'm like, I'm gonna build this whole thing, which will give me free time and then I can build a wrestling room and then I can, you know, all the stuff versus like, I could have just went directly to the source. So think about that. Because not that I don't think pursuing goals is great, but I think sometimes it drives us crazy, right? I know for me, it's like, I burn myself out sometimes trying to achieve this goal. I know it's a big goal I'm achieving right now. I'm running out of this goal right now. And I realize as I'm recording this, I'm like, I'm building, I got buying a movie theater. I'm building this whole event center. I'm doing these kinds of things. I'm buying a library. I can be like, why? It's like, I want to read more and write more. That's what I'm trying to do. But for some reason I'm going around about it and it's huge, you know, Russell Brunson style. Like I got to go over the top thing. And maybe it's, maybe it's still the right thing. And I'm not saying to persuade you about not doing it, but being honest with yourself, like why are you doing it? So, yeah, and just having this conversation to myself and with you at the same time. So that's my first question for you. It's like figuring out like, you're definitely a person. What is the thing you actually want? See if we could just achieve, like get you fulfilled, give that goal met right now. There's probably easier way we can fulfill that. And you can still chase the dream. Don't think that I'm advocating not doing that. I'm obsessed with chasing dreams and having big goals and visions. So I'm not against that, do that. But what if we got your needs met at the beginning and not the end? What if you were already happy and fulfilled? What if you didn't have to stress about that kind of stuff? How would that change the journey for you? Do you have more fun? Would you enjoy the journey longer? So what is that? What is that? And why you'd ask why at multiple times, not just once. The last level I want to take this is your audience. When you get to storytelling, this is one of the pieces that so many people miss. I talk about it's an extra secrets book, but it's like, you have to understand this for your audience. Like you have to understand the achievement they want, but you also need to understand like, what is the thing that they are secretly desiring? I say secretly because they don't even know. Subconsciously desiring. The thing that they're chasing, right? Again, I talked about an extra secrets, and you tell a story, I tell my story of achievement. But if I really want to connect with somebody, both empathy and rapport with someone really quickly, when I got started in this business, I just met my wife, fell in love with her, we got married. She was supporting me, I was wrestling, and she wanted to start a family. She's my wife's five and a half years older than me, so she wanted to start a family quickly. And I couldn't end up like, oh, so I want to start a business, right? So I used to tell people like, oh, I'm starting a business online, so I want to be an internet guy, I don't want to be a bunch of money. So that was the journey of achievement that would tell people, right? If I tell them that, and most people are like, oh yeah, me too, you get some people, but if you want to get some people who follow you for life, it's coming back down to the same. But like, if I'm honest with myself, the real reason why I wanted to start a business and make money, because my wife, she's the coolest. She's five and a half years older than me, she's been supporting me, she's been working, but she just wants a family, I guess she really wants it. I want to figure out a way I can support her. She can be a mom, that would be the coolest thing. She can be a mom, she wouldn't have to work, she can stay at home, be a mom, raise the kids, like do her dream, and her old dream is like, her life, she wanted to be a mom, it's all she ever wanted, and she's been working, she's 20 at this time, she was 27 years old, and I also want to be with mom, and I was like, I want to give her that gift. I don't care about making money or a business, but if I can retire her so she can do that, let me start a family, we have kids, and then she can be the mom she wants to be, that's the thing that fired me up, right? That's the reason why I wanted to do it. So I tell someone that story, that's me going five levels deep on why, right? Why do I start a business? Make money, why? So I can be, make my wife proud, why? So I can, no, it's like, because in our private conversations, that's what she wanted, and that's what she was hoping for, and dreaming for, and praying for, and I was like, man, I'm in a spot where I can make that happen for, and like, how great would that be if I could do that for my wife, right? So I share that story, and it happens, like, yeah, I bet me just telling a story right now, a lot of you guys are probably like, wow, I thought Russell was just this direct response marketer guy, it's like, no, he started this because he wanted to give his wife that, and then he built this because he wanted to get back to wrestling, and like, I've had a chance the last seven years to wrestle with my kids, I've never spent any time with them, it was magical, right? It was the thing that I wanted, and so, what do you actually want? Do you actually want what your customers actually want? If you can figure out the answers and that I believe it's a shortcut to success. Anyway, so this video is open for discussion, I don't know the answers to all these questions yet, in fact, that's why I'm writing this next book, because I'm going deep trying to figure these things out for myself, and I figure if I can solve these questions for myself, hopefully I can solve them with other people as well. So if you have ideas, please, in the comments down below, let me know, drop them down, I read the comments on YouTube all the time, they're really fun, and I guess the biggest question I'm gonna leave you guys with today in this video, is what do you really want? You can really answer that, that's gonna change everything for you. Figure out for yourself, and then, secondarily, for the people you've been called to serve, this could be your family, all you guys have been called to serve your family, or what do they actually want? They've been called to serve an audience, a group, you know? What do they want? If you can help them to achieve the real reason why, not the big why that they are willing to admit, not the journey of transformation, but the, or not the journey of achievement, but the journey of transformation that they have deep in their heart, they may not even consciously know of, if you can help them achieve that along the way, that'll change everything. So, hope you enjoyed this video, I hope you guys got something good from this. If you did, let me know in the comments down below what it is, and hopefully I'll see you guys, I don't know, let me know, do you want me to film some more stuff in the wrestling room? If so, this is where the magic happens, this is my happy place, this is my man cave, some dudes got man caves, a whole bunch of stuff, I've got a wrestling room with some weights, some treadmills, some bags, some bats, some pads, I love combat sports, love wrestling, love everything you do with that. In fact, my biggest regret in my life is I have not done any kind of mixed martial arts style fights, so thinking about it, think I should do it? Yeah, thinking about it. I told Todd Brown, Tessa, the two biggest things I want to do before I die that I haven't done yet. Number one is an MMA fight, and number two is a bodybuilding competition, so. Anyway, maybe we'll queue us up here in the near future. I don't know, I haven't decided yet, I'm not committed yet. It sounds like a lot of fun though, just didn't know that I did it once. I just know though, I still compete at wrestling, and it's really fun to compete at wrestling, but the thing is, I didn't rise and they film all those, you can find them online, but once you guys found them online, I started posting and I was like, wow, I am out of shape wrestling with love handles and pasty white skin, I gotta get in shape before I go next time, so people find it. I just know that if I lose the MMA fight, you guys are gonna blow it up all the way to the internet, like, quick wrestling gonna beat up, which I guess is kind of funny. So anyway, I'm not against it, I just, you know, the anxiousness, the nerves, but let me know what you guys want to do, go and do it, go accomplish it, go directly to the source of your happiness as you are achieving things. Don't wait for the achievement to happen, to get the thing you think you want, go and get it right now, as you are working towards your achievement, if you do that, then you can have it all. You can have true success, which you get my definition of success, as achievement plus fulfillment equals success. You got both those things together, that's what true happiness comes from. So thanks so much, appreciate y'all, and see you guys on the next video.
