Hey, got a cool question for you. Based on their marketing and their sales funnels alone, which of these candidates is gonna win the President of the United States? Okay, not based on your favorite policy or your favorite, who you like the best, but based on their marketing and sales funnels alone, is it gonna be Donald Trump or is it gonna be Kamala Harris? Now, to end this video, I'm gonna give you my prediction on who I think is gonna win based on their marketing alone, but I'm curious for you, who do you think is gonna win? Let me know in the comments down below. And real quick, I wanna state, this video is not gonna get political, my goal is not to try to be divisive, but more so, just based on marketing and sales alone, which candidate should be the one who wins this election? And what I'm gonna do during this video is I'm actually gonna go through seven different things that have been happening in this campaign. If you've been watching it, they've been kind of amazing. From the marketing to the sales, the sales funnels, the donations, the campaigns, the affiliates, like all the things they've been doing. So I'm gonna walk through seven things, and after each of these different elements, I'm gonna post down in the comments based on that thing alone, not on, again, not on who you want to win, but based on that element alone, who actually won the election. So I want you to blow up the comments down below for each of the seven different ideas right now. All right, point number one. Who has the best campaign motto? Now that may sound like kind of a weird thing, but the reason why it matters to me is because a couple years ago, I wrote a book called Expert Secrets, and in this book, I have a whole chapter about creating a future-based cause. Like, how do you get people to move and to follow you? And I did a really fascinating thing. I actually wrote this book during one of the last election cycles. I was watching the candidates up there battling on stage, and I realized that one of them had a future-based cause, and one of them had a present-based cause. I started thinking, I wonder who's gonna win based on that? And then I went back in time, all the way back to 1980. I looked at every single presidential campaign since 1980, and what's fascinating is that whichever candidate focused on a present-based cause, they, 100% of the time, 1980 all the way now, lost, and those whose campaign motto was based on a future-based cause, those candidates all won. Okay, so check this out, 1980, it was Jimmy Carter versus Ronald Reagan. His campaign motto was, a tested and trustworthy team, very present-based. Ronald Reagan, his was Make America Great Again. Where did Trump get that idea? You got it from Ronald Reagan, 1980. Future-based cause, Reagan won. 84, Walter Mondite, for new leadership. Ronald Reagan, it's morning again in America. Who won that one? Well, I was four years old at the time, but it looks like Ronald Reagan won that one as well. George Bush, read my lips, no new taxes, versus Bob Dole, a leader for America. Future-based cause versus present-based. And again, it goes every single time, all the way through, up until the last election. So last election was a little bit weird, I'm not gonna lie, last election, 2020, I remember watching it, because again, this book had come out a couple years earlier, and I remember thinking, okay, just based on campaign motto alone, who's gonna win? And if you look at the two campaign models, both of them were actually future-based causes. Bidens was our best days still ahead. Future-based cause, kind of a weak one. And Donald Trump's was Make America Great Again. Now, Donald Trump had used that future-based cause four years earlier in one of the election, and this was four years later, it was right when the pandemic was hitting, he used it again, both of those were future-based causes, but I don't feel like either of them were really strong just because of the timing of it. Obviously, Biden won the elections that year. And so this year, I started thinking, okay, well, based on this right now, what's Kamala using, what's Trump using? So I'm gonna go through the campaign slogans I was able to find, these are some from Kamala. So one of them is, we choose freedom, present-based. When we fight, we win, present-based. Fighting for the people, present-based. Together, we can win this, present-based, okay? Trump's, he's going back to the Make American Great Again. Now, I do think this time is different than last time. The very first time he used that was at a time when America's been very divisive and they want to change, and so it worked really well. Well, the next election cycle, it was a little different. This one, I do think is a good future-based cause, but it is repetitive, and he hasn't been using it quite as strong. Now, one thing that was fascinating is after his assassination attempt, he changed on his home page, as I'll show you here in a minute, their headline slash campaign motto is, they're not after me, they're after you, I'm just standing in the way. Which isn't really a future-based cause, but is a fear-based cause, which was kind of fascinating. Now, one thing that was very interesting as well is recently over the last month or so, he decided to partner with RFK. Now, RFK's campaign does have a future-based cause. His is Make America Healthy Again. And so by default of them partnering together, coming underneath one banner, RFK's future-based cause is lumped into Trump's on the campaign trail. So, based on that alone, that's thing number one, based on that alone, who do you think should win the election just based off of their future-based cause, their campaign motto alone? So let me know down in the comments down below, right? Number one, and then type in, who's do you think was better? Okay? All right, that's number one. Let's move on now to number two. So number two is their actual sales funnel. I just showed you guys pictures of the two funnels. I'm gonna pull up here on the laptop so we can break down some of the interesting things that are happening inside of their campaign funnels. All right, the first one I'm gonna pull up is Kamala Harris's site. When you go to the site, a couple things. There is a splash screen ahead of time with the next live event they have happening. So she's two hours, 19 minutes, 52 seconds away from doing something really big. She's about to go step on her town hall. And so they're getting donations right now. Trying to raise an extra $5 million before she gets on the stage tonight. So there's a countdown clock, a donate button for just like quick people giving donations. And then also there's this pop down right here, which is getting people to join her email newsletter. So, which is obviously great. So that was first page. If you close this down, it takes you directly to her actual landing page. The same one I showed you earlier. And a couple things you notice, she's leading with getting people's contact information. It's not looking for the email address though. She's got 13 days left and they're trying to get your home address. And so it's kind of interesting campaign. Obviously they're trying to figure out if people are in a swing state or not to get their contact information then to get them to go and actually donate from there. And you scroll down again, there's another section for donations. And then there's a whole bunch of social proof, the events, the agendas, different things that they're talking about, different policies down here. Again, there's another block where you can opt in as a volunteer to go out there and help them to knock doors, make calls, host events and share content. So they have you sign up as a volunteer. So another call to action on the page. Then they got their merch shop and then another place to update the email address. And then down below there's another banner for things. So my big feeling is a confused mind always says no. We try to always on any landing page have just one core focus and they've got five or six core focus here. So I'm not sure if they want me to donate or get an email list or buy some merch or become a volunteer or donate or, yeah, there's a lot of different things. One thing I would do is very much hone things in and focus on one core message to get somebody in and then from there, you know, get their email address from there, find out their state from there, having become a volunteer, but taking through a process as opposed to like, here's every offer we have right on the landing page. So that's kind of my initial take right there on Kamala's. Next one is Trump's. Trump's pulls up and the very first thing his pop up has a picture of him at McDonald's like please donate today. So both Kamala and Trump have quick spots where they want you to donate right out of the gate. So show up like, hey, donate some money as quick as you can. When you shut down his pop up for the donation, then it comes after here and boom, he leads with a strong campaign slogan. They're not after me, they're after you. I'm just standing in the way. Contribute or volunteer. So now easily splitting the traffic into two different things. Like you're here to contribute, you're here to volunteer. They're two different options. If you've got money, contribute. If you don't come volunteer and you can work and help us along the way. Come down here. His initial next big call to action is get on the email list. He's asking for email address and zip code. Get you on the list quickly. So he can communicate with you. One thing we noticed by joining this list though, I don't think I've gotten any actual emails from him. So I don't know why. So he's collecting the emails. He's just not doing a good job of sending them or maybe just not getting delivered, which is another definitely possibility. He's got more information on his platform down here, other videos, his stores, all the socials, things like that. So this one though is a lot clear up front. Having the initial headline, which is their future based cause, pushing people down two different paths and getting the email address all above the fold. But there are still a lot of different messages. And so, obviously those are some of the things on both of their funnels coming out the game. Okay, now if you go to their actual, those are their home pages for their names. They have separate pages that are actually driving traffic to for contributions. What's interesting about this, I have a lot of friends who for a living, they do lead gen for political campaigns. And so they come and for example, they've come here and they'll drive someone to this page right here and they're getting a CPA. So every single time somebody donates money, they get paid money. There's huge marketing campaigns. Some of you guys are probably not even aware of their happening behind the scenes to generate revenue for the election, right? So they're spending ads money to drive traffic here to get contributions. They obviously, you can do the dollar amount, but then you can also make it weekly and tell the general election, which is kinda cool. So it's $10 a week or $50 a week. They're trying to get people on continuity as quick as possible. And then the payments there. And so there's the Harris Wallace one. When you try to exit, they have an exit pop with a donate $25, which is kinda cool. Now if I come to the Trump one, this is a little bit different. It's got the big picture of Trump there because Trump's always gotta take up two thirds of the space. Left hand side's got the message. And there's more copy in this, which is kinda interesting. And so he's talking to the people, right? Very copy driven, not just hey donate money. If you come back here to Kamala, it's not much more than pitching to elect Kamala. Time's running out, give us some money. Whereas Donald does a better job of telling a story. There it is, his fear not. He might have my donation pushes back on the page. And then he's got copy here. The left thinks that they bury me with enough witch hunts and intimidate my family and associates that will eventually throw at my hands and give up on our first movement, blah, blah, blah. And he's got a copy, like writing, convincing, talking about why they should donate money, right? Not just asking for money. Here then he goes and asks for the amount of money you wanna donate. Couple things here he lets, like you pick the money and then you can also say, hey, from here, oh and American flags blow up when you click on something, which is kinda cool. You can cover the processing fees that way. He doesn't pay the processing fees. If you wanna donate weekly, again, it doesn't say donate weekly, it actually has copy there explaining why to donate weekly. So yes, count me in. There's order form bump to donate. To double your donation and then another order form bump to get another donation again. And all these order form bumps have really good copies explaining why to do this, right? Red alert from Trump, come on, let's war chest. Just hit $1 billion. Our numbers about to go public for the world to see, you know, like he's using really good copy. And then down here, if you're tired, you click on that. So definitely much more heavy copy driven, getting people a reason to actually donate money. So I thought that was interesting as well. And the last thing which is interesting, I think is that both of the candidates have a store for swag. So here's Kamala's swag store. She's got posters, she's got flags, all sorts of really cool things down here. One thing I thought was really interesting and kind of confusing was she has, you can download her cornbread recipe for $0. So that's on her store. So if you want Kamala's cornbread dressing recipe, that is on the swag store. So that's there. And then Trump's swag store pops up right here. And again, all things that people would have in there, you know, maybe we're into the campaigns, the rallies, outvoting, stuff like that, all focusing on their future-based cause. So there is the core components of the actual sales funnels that both Harris and Trump are running. So question for you now, number two, based on just the sales funnels alone, who do you think should actually win? So down below type in number two and type in Harris or Trump. And let us know why you believe that based on their sales funnels alone, not who you like the best, based on the sales funnels and messaging, who should be winning right now at election, based on number two. All right, example number three. Now we're going to transition to actual paid ads. The ads that they were using to drive people to go donate, to come to their causes, all sorts of stuff like that. Now I found a YouTube channel, Jim Heath, who has been basically all the ads that he's been seeing, he's been pulling them and posting them on this channel. And so there are tons and tons of ads here. Now I don't know about you, depending on where you live in the country, depends on whether or not you're actually seeing any of these ads. I'm in Idaho, which is one of, if not the most, conservative state in the country. And so they don't spend very much money. Anything at all actually marketing here. But I remember a couple of years ago, I was speaking at an event in Las Vegas, Nevada, Swing State, and I went two weeks for election to go speak at this event. I got there, I remember turning on the TV, and it was bombarded ad, ad, ad. All I saw was just ads, campaign back, forth, back, forth, and I was like, this is insane. But I'd never seen any of those things happening in Idaho or Utah where I grew up. The reason why is because we're not in Swing State. So if you're in a Swing State, you will see, you've probably seen all these ads 5,000 times. But for me it was fun to watch because I'm not singing. They're not showing them to me, they're just showing them to the audience that they are trying to get to transition and to be the swing voters. And so if you look at these, there's a couple, we'll play a couple seconds of each one because they're kind of fun. A Trump advisor told producers that Trump was exhausted and refusing interviews. He would be the oldest president ever inaugurated if he wins in November. He will not agree to a second presidential debate. The former president was swaying and asked to play songs. For about 40 minutes, Donald Trump's public appearances had deteriorated. My stomach is speaking many asurasians. Just like putting a million Rambos that also vests his toll on as my friend. There is no way that this man who can't make it through an entire speech, who keeps canceling things, is gonna be the person that does four more years. There's one anti-Trump ad. Once again, fascinating for me to see because I had not had a chance to see any of these. Let me pull a Harris ad now. This is the Jim Heath channel playlist of 2024 campaign ads. The Biden-Harris administration just admitted they released thousands of illegal immigrants convicted of violent crimes. Kamala lied. An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. They released murderers. An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. Human traffickers. An undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. Rapists, all released under Kamala. President Trump warned us. He'll deport these thugs, secure the border and make our streets safe again. I'm Donald J. Trump and I approve this message. Be sure to subscribe to the Jim Heath. Okay, so again, these ads are brutal. Again, I don't have a chance to see these in Idaho, but back and forth and back and forth, you look through the channel. So these are the ads they're writing, they're creating, and they're only targeting the swing states, right? That's where these things are heavily dominated. They're spending tens of millions of dollars, as you'll see, all focusing on getting these ads shown to the swing states. So that's what the paid ads are looking like. But the question is, how much are they actually spending on paid media? Now, I know about you, one of my biggest goals this year that I'm focusing on before the end of years, my goal is to get the spot. We're spending $150,000 a day on ads to fill one of our challenges. So that's my number, my benchmark. I know how much effort and work goes into my team to be able to get to that. We have not gotten to that number consistently yet, but that is my entire focus, is like, how do I get the spot? We're spending $150,000 a day on ads every single day. And so when I saw what the actual finances were for a campaign like this, it is insane. Okay, so check this out. If you pull this up right here, this is showing a bunch of really cool things. So first off, this first graph here is showing the fundraising. So based on this, you can see Kamala has raised just shy or just about a billion dollars in fundraising, where Donald Trump has raised $375 million. Okay, that's the first number. As you scroll down here a little bit further. The next one is showing how campaign spending. So Kamala's already spent $724 million. Three quarters of a billion dollars has been spent so far on this campaign, which she's only been the official candidate now for what, two months or so? Trump right now has spent $256 million, about a quarter of a billion dollars. So she is out spending in three to one right now, pushing her ads into these different swing states, which is fascinating. You can look at cash on hand, obviously both candidates, you see it dropping down as right now as we're leading up to the home stretch, they're ramping up and spending more and more media as much as possible, which is why if any of you guys are running Facebook ads or YouTube ads in any of the swing states, you notice your cost per acquisition has dramatically gone up. If you haven't yet, means you're not spending enough money to notice, but it has been a little bit crazy. Can't wait for the selection to be over, so we can get back to normal CPAs. Anyway, that's besides the point. So that's kind of what's happening, and how much money they are actually spending, which is crazy. In fact, it was showing that Kamala right now is spending $5 million more per day than the Trump campaign, which means I think Trump's two, two and a half, three million, some of that, so she's probably seven to eight million dollars a day in ads. Again, me with our entire team focusing like crazy, including getting every English-speaking country across the world are struggling to get to the spot we're spending $100,000, $150,000 a day, and they're doing $5 million. So seven to eight million dollars per day in ads, focusing on just six little states. It's kind of crazy. Okay, so that is number three, are the ads and the ad spend. So based solely alone on just number three, who do you think should be winning this campaign? Is it Trump or is it Harris? So down below right now, number three, and right now Trump or Kamala, based on who you think is winning based on this alone. Once again, this is not based on your opinion on who you like the best, who's got the best ads, and the most media spend behind them. Who should win based on that alone? All right, number four is social media. And this one's weird because obviously a lot of social media channels, I didn't go through all of them because that would take forever. I just went through some of the biggest ones, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, to kind of look at what both candidates were doing. And what I've noticed, a couple of interesting things. So if you look at Kamala, you pull up her YouTube channel, they're posting a lot of videos, pretty consistently, a lot of short form. There's one 54 minutes ago, six hours ago, seven hours ago, seven hours ago, eight hours ago, one day ago, one day ago, one day ago. But if you look at the actual views, their videos are not getting that many views. The higher getting 12,000 views, most of them five, 2,000, 3,000. And so while they are posting a lot of content, they're not leveraging the YouTube algorithm correctly because the amount of views they're getting is really, really low. So that's number one. And then if you pull over Trump's YouTube channel, you'll notice similar things. As they're getting closer and closer to election, they're ramping up postings. There's one nine hours ago, nine hours ago, 10 hours ago, one day ago, three days ago, three days ago, four days ago, five days ago. So they're starting to ramp up the amount of posts. He's getting a lot more. He's getting 34,000, 85,000, 36,000, 18,000, but still not insane, right? A good YouTuber will post a video and get a million, five million, 10 million views, whereas the two people running for the presidential campaign, they're getting 5,000 views on Kamala's side to 40 or 50,000 on Trump's side. So he's definitely beating your ear on YouTube, but regardless, it's like a splash in the water. It doesn't really seem to be doing a lot on their YouTube channel. So there's YouTube. Number two, we're looking at Twitter. So Twitter's actually really interesting. Kamala's got 21 million followers on hers, and she is posting pretty consistently, again, as we're getting closer and closer, it's ramping up the posting, right? 14 minutes ago, one hour ago. So the posts are coming in pretty aggressively. A lot of the ads, a lot of the soundbites, all things are going in there, and she's getting great engagement on all these different posts. So that's number one. When you pull up Trump, Trump's platform used to be Twitter, obviously, back in the day before he got banned, and now he's back, but based on today, he only has 2.5 million followers, and a lot of what he's posting are, he's posting news clips and reposting stuff like that, but it's just not, some of these are getting a lot of views, a lot of comments, but regardless, again, for a political campaign, I would think that socially, they should be getting a lot more engagement and stuff like that than they actually are. Facebook, last one I'll show you guys, very similar as well. Okay, on Kamala's Facebook page, she's got 5.5 million followers. Same thing, she's posting a lot, but when you look at this, 1,000 likes, 700 comments, 92 shares. For how much they spend on the paid ad side, it shocks me at how poor all of them are on the free organic side. I'll pull up Trump's Facebook page as well, but again, very similar on his, he's got 35 million followers here, and from that, again, 17 comments, 20 shares. 12,000 comments, 2.8 thousand shares, 20 thousand. So Trump's definitely getting more engagement here, but at the same time, what they're posting a lot of time is just stuff that's not shareable that people don't really get excited by. So it's good, but not great. So socially, I feel like neither of them really hired a really solid social strategist to put together a really cool social campaign. They could have saved them a lot of money. I mean, you take some of that five to $8 million a day you're spending on Facebook ads and hire a really good social team. You could be getting, you know, as much bang for your buck focusing there, but they didn't. So with that said though, based on what you just saw, curious for number four down below is based on social media alone, which candidate you think should actually be winning? Let us know down below. Again, not basically you like the most, who you actually follow socially, but based on what you just saw, who with social profile is the one that you think should make them the president. All right, number five is email and text message marketing. I'm sure that if you guys are subscribed to either side of this, you've been getting bombarded by tons and tons of texts. No, obviously I'm not in a swing state, so I don't see most of the ads that are happening right now, but I've got a friend who's in a swing state. Him and his wife have different political beliefs. And so because of that, he has a chance to get both messages on both sides and see all of them. And so he was showing me all the different things and a couple of fascinating things. So for the Harris campaign, right now he's getting three text messages a day. And the coolest thing is that when he responds back to them, this person on their side is actually a real human being. So they have lots of volunteers who are actually engaging in these texting campaigns back and forth to people. He's also getting two emails per day. And the emails keep coming from different people on the campaign. They're all coming from Kamala Harris. They keep changing from sender. So emails are coming from different people. And they get about two emails a day. On the Trump side, he's getting one text message a day from Trump side. And when he responds back, there's no response that's coming back. So it's all mass texting with nobody on the other side, having actual conversations and communications through text, which is really interesting. And emails, he joined the email list as did I and have not got a single email yet. So either they have really bad deliverability or they're just for some reason not sending out emails. One of my friends got a text today as he knew I was making this video and sent it to me. This is what the text message said. It said, Trump $5 for assigned Elon Musk dark MAGA hat. That's not all $5 gets you. Five reasons to give before deadline. And then you click on the link and it takes you to this page right here. And this is a personal request from Trump. And it's kind of interesting. It says, waiting for reasons to give $5 and support Trump, I'll give you five of them. $5 enters you to win an Elon Musk dark MAGA hat signed by me, not me, by him, me, by Trump. $5 gets you on the official Trump donor list. When we win, although we have you to thank, $5 ensures we hit our FEC deadline goals. Our numbers go public every 48 hours. And $5 keeps our ads running in Pennsylvania. If we win there, it's over for Kamala. One last reason. If I can get every single Patrick, Trump support or reading this email to chip in just $5, Kamala sends no chance of the ballot box. Give $5, Donald Trump and then boom, there's the campaign thing down below. So giving people a reason to donate. It's one of the biggest things in marketing, especially if you're running an affiliate program. If you give affiliates a reason to promote, you're giving your customers a reason to buy an ally. So you're trying to figure out other ways to get people to actually donate and to do the things. So that's what's happening in the text message campaign. So that's number five, based on that alone. Type in the comments, number five, who do you think should win the campaign based solely on just the text message email campaign? Again, at the end of this video, I'm gonna tell you who I think's winning at each of these categories. I wanna see your votes down below first. Okay, number six, dramatic demonstrations. If you follow me at all, you know that one of the key things we teach people to do is doing dramatic demonstrations to promote their funnel. So obviously Trump and Kamala both have these huge funnels. They have huge fundraising campaigns. They have all these things happening. And so they are also doing dramatic demonstrations to get people to come into their funnels, to donate money, right? So I was just mapping out some of the dramatic demonstrations that I have seen over the last little bit. One that Kamala Harris has done really, really well is she did a huge show with Oprah. Oprah's obviously the star of the personality. They brought Oprah on stage, but then Oprah also brought all the celebrities who promote Kamala as well, right? So it became this huge multi-hour long testimonial session where the Kamala Oprah interview was the secret sauce to keep people coming to watch and all these other guests are coming on. Again, famous people, actors, actresses, all sorts of stuff. And so they create tons of social proof for her, right? So it brought people into, you know, who wanted to see the Oprah Kamala interview. A lot of people in the swing states, people who are undecided, come and watch that and then have all of the social proof from all these other people to help push people's votes over the edge, right? So that's what Harris is doing. The Trump side, he's done a lot of things as well. Number one that happened just recently was the whole McDonald's stunt, right? He obviously went to McDonald's, put on a thing and worked for like an hour to make a French fries and hand him out to people, right? That one little thing he did alone, that one little tiny dramatic demonstration got so much footage, so much media, so many people talking about it and seeing it. I mean, that was worth probably $10 million in paid ad spend he got for free by just doing the one dramatic demonstration. Another one that Trump's been doing now for years. And the only reason why I know this is I'm a big UFC fan. And so I was at UFC 299 watching Sugar Sean fight. My wife and I had front row seats with my birthday party, a birthday present to myself. Sitting down there watching the fight and sure enough, 20 minutes into the main event, who comes through the door, Donald Trump, comes in, waves everyone, gets everyone cheering and he shows up at all these things over and over and we get great dramatic demonstrations for these little niche audiences and he's been doing it consistently for years. The last really cool dramatic demonstration that Trump did is in Butler, he came back for the funeral of the person who passed away from the shooting and he threw on this huge event. And a lot of people were like, you know, you have a traumatic event happen somewhere, you're not gonna go back there, you'd be very protective. Instead, he threw a bigger event there. I think they had like 100,000 people show up this event and did another huge dramatic demonstration. We had a story behind it because it was at the spot where he had the attempted assassination actually happened. And the last thing that's not a dramatic demonstration yet, I can see both candidates trying to do this and by the time you watch this, maybe it'll already happen, but the Joe Rogan show, both candidates are contemplating, trying to get on the show and have Joe Rogan interview them, which I hope he does, because Joe Rogan is the man and it'd be awesome to have Joe Rogan speak to both of these guys on both sides and really get some good feedback. So either one of those, when it happens, will be a dramatic demonstration in front of the greatest interviewers ever lived on this planet. So, all right, that's number six. So based on number six alone, which is the dramatic demonstrations, who do you think should be winning the political campaign for President of the United States, based solely alone on the dramatic demonstrations that have been happening? Again, number six, type number six down below, let us know who should win and give us your reason why. Okay, that's does jump into number seven. We got a couple more here. Number seven is all about joint venture partners. Who are you partnering with to add to your credibility? Now, I'll mention the one that we mentioned earlier with Kamala. So obviously Kamala did a joint venture with Oprah and then all of the celebrities, like that was a huge joint venture, it brought Oprah's audience, plus all of these celebrities audiences into the fold, right? It's a joint venture with two different people coming together. I feel like Kamala's in an excellent job as well, partnering with the mainstream media, okay? Outside of Fox News, all the other media stations very much are aligned with Kamala, her message, her party. And so these are all joint ventures that the Democratic Party has been building and running for years, right? So those are two big joint ventures on Kamala's side. Joint ventures on the Trump side, and there's a lot of them, and a lot of really fun ones recently. One of them obviously is Elon Musk, right? I'm not gonna go too deep into it, and you saw Elon Musk come to these rallies. He's speaking on stage, he's bringing people in, he's out there talking about how if Trump doesn't win this election, then no other election will ever matter in the future. And like, Elon is, you know, at one time the richest man in the world, but definitely the most controversial person in the world probably, and brought him under the fold, right? That was a big one. RFK was a huge one. Think about this, RFK is a Democrat. It was on the other side, and was able to bring him over and bring him into their camp and their party, which is a joint venture, which brings now all of the following RFK, people who wanna make America healthy again, people in anti-war. That segment of the market, all canal came with Trump because of the one joint venture party he brought into his campaign. One thing I wanna show you is really cool about JFK. Obviously, he is someone who was running for president for a while. So I'll do a real quick recap on his phone. If you've got his page right now, it's really cool. He's got MAHA, right? Make America Healthy Again, which is his future base cause, and down there, getting people to join email and jump into the list. Main focus, email list, and he's got obviously swag and stuff down below. But one thing that was kinda cool, if you scroll all the way to the bottom of his, check this out, he's got a link, says affiliate program. All of us funneled nerds and marketing guys. We all have affiliate programs selling our products, right? And the only one I was able to find was RFK. He has an affiliate program where basically you can promote through your own QR code, you can promote this. And when people buy swag, when they do door hanging, like when they do anything, if they donate money, you get 15% back for being the one who introduces them to his movement. So I thought that was really, really fascinating, the fact that he had an affiliate program for his donations. And I don't know why all candidates don't have that cause it would be huge for him. And so those are, there's other ones, but those are the two big joint venture partners on the Trump side that thought were really strategic and very smart and very powerful to bring those audiences in. So that was number seven. So based on number seven alone, who do you think should win the presidential campaign? So down in the comments down below, type in number seven and type in who based on just the joint venture partners alone, you think should win this political election. Okay, with that said, I'm gonna go through the seven different points and tell you who I think should want at each of the different levels. And then as the campaign as a whole, I'm gonna show you one last graph and then talk about who I think is probably gonna win based on that alone. So you guys ready for that? All right, here is Russell's version of these. So number one, campaign model. I talked about having a future-based cause. I do think of the campaign models that Trump's is the only one that is actually a future-based cause. So based on the predictions of the expert secrets book, where I showed every single election since 1980 to here, where the person with the future-based cause always won, I'm gonna say based on the campaign model alone, Trump will win based on the campaign model alone. There's number one. All right, let's jump into number two, for their funnel alone. Okay, we showed you Harris's funnel, we showed you Trump's funnel. Both are similar, but the biggest difference I saw is Trump did a much better job with the copy in the funnel. It wasn't just asking for, give us the donation, but there was copy at every single step, explaining why. The order form bumps had copy. Everything was more copy heavy, copy driven. And you guys who are split testing a lot of pages and funnels, you know the copy is king. And so I would say that based on their sales funnels alone and the copy on the funnels that Trump definitely won the number two, which is the sales funnel. All right, moving on to number three, paid ads. Okay, now as someone who is obsessed with paid ads and trying to spend as much as I can every single day to get people into my challenges and my funnels, I would say on this one, not so much based on the ads, both ads are just very divisive. I don't love the ad strategy on either side, but you know, politics is what it is. So Kamala's spending $750 million, three quarters of a billion dollars on her paid ad campaigns, while Trump only spent $250 million, so a quarter of a billion dollars. Right now Kamala is spending $5 million more per day in paid ads. So just based on paid ads and paid ads alone, I would say that I'm gonna give number three to Kamala because whoever can spend the most money to acquire customer wins according to Dan Kennedy. So Kamala wins number three, number four, social media. I gotta be honest, I was shockingly disappointed in the social media of both sides. I don't think that they ran the campaign smart or strategic or anything other than just posting clips of what they had. So I would give zero of them any benefit out. I will vote on this one for Trump, just because the average views of his was about five times higher than Kamala's, but like honestly they were both pretty bad. So I'm gonna give this one to Trump barely. Number five, text message email marketing. This one's actually fascinating to me. So based on what I showed you guys, the Harris campaign is texting, but they're not just like blanket like mass texting. There is conversations happening back and forth. So while Trump I think is sending out really good offers and really good reasons why people should go and they should donate money through their text messaging, they're not engaging with people at a social level. The fact that there are real people on the backside of Kamala's having conversations and dialing, even if it is AI, maybe it is. My belief is that they actually have volunteers who are doing these questions back and forth. And also based on the fact that after opting in to Trump's funnel, we haven't got a single email, I would say that number five, I would give this to Kamala based on the email and text message marketing campaign alone. Kamala wins number five for me. All right, number six, dramatic demonstrations. I'm not gonna lie, it's really funny watching them talk about the rallies. You've got the most people at the rallies, but when all of a sudden, if I look at what happens at the rallies and just the things behind them, I do think the Oprah dramatic demonstration was very smart, very strategic, very much something that I would do. Like if I look at the way I do my campaigns, I think that one very fits in line with something I would do. But I'm not gonna lie, Trump's is more creative with the McDonald's, BNUFC, going back to Butler, like some of those things are just they're iconic, they're powerful. I definitely give number six the best dramatic demonstrations to Donald Trump. And number seven, JV partners. I'm an Elon fan, I'm an RFK fan. And so the fact that he was able to get Elon to be part of it is big. The fact that he got RFK coming from being a Democrat over to his side, I think is honestly good for society. I think having people on both sides working together is the smartest. And so I think as far as JV partners bringing in RFK and working with him is one of the coolest things I've ever seen. So I'm definitely a big fan. I think for number seven, I'm gonna give JV partners to Mr. Donald Trump. Okay, then last thing I wanna show you guys is as a campaign, they taking all seven of these things, all the marketing, the sales, everything talked about today, who do you think is going to win? Again, I'm not political, I'm not super heavily invested in the campaigns or anything outside of just studying it for the marketing because I find that very fascinating. But this is one poll I wanna show you guys based on what's happening. This is betting odds. This is what people are actually willing to do with their money, right? They're betting on this. They're putting their credit card, where their mouth is, right? As opposed to just like polls and things that are random. So this one, these polls are really interesting. If you look at this campaign, this shows you as things are going, like where the splits are, where things are transitioning, stuff like that. In fact, it's interesting if you come back here, you can see this is where the Biden debate happened where you see it split, where Trump spiked to 66%, Biden's down to 18%. And then when Harris came to the campaign, she spiked and then started passing Trump for a while and then dropped back down during the debates. Actually, back here is where I think where Trump got shot. He popped up again for a little bit, then Harris came back and then right there, she came back out of the debate and then dropped. And then now we're on the final stretch and you're watching as all of the advertising dollars are being dumped in the States, what's actually happening and you're watching this as you move forward, this line is spreading and it's shifting. So based on a whole, if you take all of those seven principles together, paid ads, free ads, joint venture partners, the sales funnel, the messaging, like all the things combined together, based on this, Donald Trump is pulling away pretty dramatically. So obviously we've got a week from the time that I dropped this video, the election will be happening two weeks from the time I'm recording this. And so we'll see what happens over the next two weeks. As you can see here, things are shifting and changing very, very quickly in real time. One dumb move, one bad dramatic demonstration, one failed campaign can shift an election. So it'll be interesting to see kind of how everyone plays it out over the next, you know, 14 days for me, seven days for you now as you're watching this. But I'm curious for you guys, based on all the stuff that you see and you know, not again, not who you think is going to win because of who you connect with the most or whose policies you believe, but who do you believe is going to win just solely based on as a whole, all seven principles, the marketing thing. Put your final thoughts in the comments down below. Be curious to see what you think. With that said, all of you guys here in America, get out there and vote. Make sure that you let your voice be heard for whatever you believe. Other than that, be safe. Great for you guys all. And let's pray for a safe, violent free election. Thanks you guys and I will see you guys on next video. Thank you.
