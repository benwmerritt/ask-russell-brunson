## Transcript
We wanted to make something as close to a virtual, like a live event as possible. It was a test, like is this gonna be big, is it not gonna be big, what's gonna happen? The man, Russell! Pay to sell your product. Love this guy. I honestly believe the entrepreneurs are the only people that can actually change this planet. So this is our very first ever virtual conference and there's a lot of reasons why we did it. We do funnel hacking live every single year, it's an event that transforms people's lives. They have a chance to come and be around other funnel hackers and entrepreneurs, all these amazing things. And then when the event leaves, people leave on cloud nine and they have the energy and the motivation, the tool, so it's everything they need to be successful throughout the year. And here at ClickFunnels we have different events that happen throughout the year. We had a lot of really fun events planned and when the coronavirus came and hit, we had to cancel most of the rest of the events throughout the year. It was tough because, you know, as a community, we need that bonding, we need to get together. As a company, as a team, we love serving our people, serving the entrepreneurs inside of ClickFunnels. And we were like, what else can we do? Still don't know when we're gonna be able to have a chance to get together again. And we thought, you know what, this weekend was supposed to be the unlock the secrets family event. We did last year in Denver, we brought families and kids all together. It was such an amazing experience. We thought, you know, we can't do that this year, we had to cancel it. But what if instead of having people come to Denver, what if we came to them? And so that's why we decided to do the virtual event where people could attend, but also their families, their kids, their spouses, their business partners, and watch them come from their own home and let us come and have the ability to serve people at their home. And that's kind of why we decided to do the Two Comic Club Live virtual event. So if you're planning on doing a virtual conference, like, make sure it's not another webinar. Like, this in itself was an in-person event. We brought the aspects that people love, the networking, the connections, you know, Russell and all that. We brought it online to the virtual space. If you're going to host a virtual event, you can't have it be a Glow or Fried webinar. You can, the results aren't going to be the same. Do it right or don't do it at all. I think people think that a virtual event is going to be simpler, right? It's like, oh, well, you're just doing it virtually. It's like, no one's even there, you're standing in a room by yourself. But they don't realize is at Funnel Hacking Live, there's maybe 5,000 people there. We have the stress of like, organizing people in and getting their name badges and getting them registered, all those kind of things. Woohoo! In reality, that's not my stress. That's the stress of my team. They do all that, right? My stress is like, I'm going to make sure that it's choreographed correctly. I'm going to make sure my presentation's running. I'm going to make sure, like, those are things I stress out at. Because of just the venue, I actually do more presentations at the virtual event than I do at Funnel Hacking Live. Because I couldn't just, you know, push play and we watch videos for three days. We do have videos we stream from past Funnel Hacking Lives, but it's the most part. Instead of me just doing one or two, it's like, I've got five or six different presentations. And then at the same time, I'm the MC, I'm the host. I'm the one introducing, I'm the one bringing people's energy up and bringing it down. And for me personally, it's actually a lot more work. Let's get those cameras on, everybody. Keep those cameras on. 20 seconds! This is so weird. It's a little funky. It's cool though. It's going to be awesome. The reality is there hasn't been a ton of innovation over the last, I don't know, three or four years. Like, a lot of the ways that we sell things, the way we communicate, they've kind of been, they're kind of there, they're finite and they haven't changed, but they work. This new environment we're in today where it's forced us to do a virtual event, it was a test. Like, is this going to be big? Is it not going to be big? What's going to happen? Get on your feet! And one step! One step! Every year at Funnel Hacking Live, it's, the anxiety for me comes like, what if I come on stage and nobody's there? Every Funnel Hacking Live, even to this day, it stresses me out. But this time, my fear was different. My fear this time was like, what if, what if people enjoy this experience? What if I come on stage and there's someone heckling, someone's talking bad to each other, or like, there's a million of things that could happen and like, that was my fear. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the man, the man, the man team, Mr. Russell Ronson! Thank you for watching!
