For those of you who are just tuning in, my name is Russell Brunson and I'm excited to have you guys here. I'm answering a whole bunch of amazing questions from entrepreneurs like you about how to grow and scale your companies and do your funnels and a whole bunch of other awesome stuff. So the question for right now for today is the best advice. It says, can you pull the curtains back and tell me your best advice and how I should go about getting started as an entrepreneur? Okay, so this is one of the problems that a lot of entrepreneurs have, right? Is it first, if you want to be an entrepreneur, there's a lot of things, right? A lot of pieces that go involved in doing this, right? And for some reason when we become entrepreneurs, we think we have to become amazing at all those things. I'm not sure why we do, but that's pretty universal for most of us, right? And so what happens is we get in this thing where we're, and it's probably because we went to school and most of us didn't like school, we struggled through school, but we get done and we're like, okay, I want to be an entrepreneur. This is the platform to be. So I'm going to be an entrepreneur. You're standing on this thing like, okay, to be an entrepreneur, what I got to do? And you're like, okay, first off, I got to have vision and then second off, I got to build a team. And then third off, I got to learn programming and I got to learn graphic design, I got to learn. And you have all these lists of all the stuff you got to do, right? And so you stand on there and you're like, okay, I got to become an entrepreneur. I got to learn all these things. Then all of a sudden, super overwhelming, right? So a lot of things that actually goes into that. And so what I recommend for entrepreneurs, if you really want to have success, it's not so much trying to figure out all those different things, okay? The goal of the entrepreneur is not to learn how to do every single piece in this puzzle, okay? The goal of the entrepreneur is number one, is to understand the strategy of what you're doing, okay? Then number two is to figure out the system. And number three is to build the team, okay? So that's the three step process. Now I want to liken this to something that most of us are aware of and makes common sense. So let's just say you went to school, instead of just getting on the platform of I'm going to be an entrepreneur, where you said I'm going to become a contractor, I'm going to build houses. Let's say you do that, right? And so you get over here and you stand on this platform of like I am a contractor, and I'm going to be building houses all day, right? Now for some reason, the rest of the world understands, as breadth entrepreneurs don't, we think we have to understand and learn how to do everything. But a contractor does not go and try to figure out, I got to learn plumbing, and I got to learn electrical work, and I got to learn how to do drywall, I got to learn how to slay cement. No, right? What does the contractor do? The contractor understands the strategy, how do you actually build a house? What are the things you need? Who are the people you need? Like what's the raw materials? What's the order has to go and what goes first, what goes second? And that's the goal of this contract, right? To understand the strategy, okay? Then the contractor got to put together systems. You got to get blueprints of like, okay, this is what we're going to do, and then he's got to get the team assembled. Okay, you're the dude who's going to lay the foundation, you're the dude who's doing the pipes, you're the guy doing the electricity, you're the person doing the roofs, and he builds the people, and then the contractor gets paid the biggest bucks, right? So we got to start to stop thinking ourselves as entrepreneurs have to learn everything and look at ourselves the same way a contractor would. Your goal as an entrepreneur is not to learn everything, it's to understand the strategy. Okay, that's why I tell people to read my books, like read the expert secrets book, read the dot com secrets book, because these books teach you the strategy, that's what you have to learn to understand. But after you understand the strategy, then it's like, okay, what's the system we're going to do? We need a funnel to make this whole thing happen. Can we have the funnel hacker cookbook for those who haven't had this? This has got like 20 different funnel structures, okay? So the systems behind how to build a funnel, it's like, cool, I know to execute on our vision, we need this funnel right here on page, whatever, right? Now you've got the system, now you've got to build a team. Who are the team of people who are going to help us execute on this, okay? I know I need a designer, I need a funnel builder, I need a copywriter, I need it, and you kind of figure out who the team is, you assemble those things together, and you go and you do it. Now some of you guys are wondering, like, well Russell, that's going to be hard, I don't have the money for this, and all those kind of things, but I want you to understand that it's the same way that I started the way most successful entrepreneurs started, right? I didn't build click funnels just off of like me being a genius, because I'm not, ask my team, like there's very few things I'm good at, right? But what am I good at? I understand the strategy, okay? I put together systems to make it happen, we built a team of amazing people. Okay, just sitting in this room right now, I've got people here who drive traffic, who do our Instagram, who do our video, who do our copy, who do our, all the people I've assembled, I don't know how to do any of the pieces, I don't know how to go and lay the piping, or the electricity, or endless things, right? I just understand the overarching strategy. So if you're a young entrepreneur, that's your number one focus, okay? So if you're looking like, let me pull back the curtains, it's like, hey, guess what, Russell's not actually Superman. He's not actually that good at many things. The one thing he's good at is understanding the strategy of where we're trying to go with our vision. And we understand that, like that's the key, that's your job as entrepreneurs, understand the strategy, okay? Think about Steve Jobs, one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our lifetime, right? Was Steve Jobs a programmer? No, was he a designer? No, he couldn't do any of those things, right? But he had the vision, this is what I want. So this strategy, okay, you start putting together a team, you got Wadz and Yek, you got his other people, build out the team, and boom, out came Apple, okay? Same thing's gonna be true for you guys. Understand that, that's your job as entrepreneurs, understand the strategy, create the systems, and build the team, and that's how you start scaling and growing an actual company. So hopefully it gives you some relief, you don't have to learn every single piece in the process. We have a really cool system coming out in the near future called FunnelRoleDex. They actually has a whole marketplace of people that you can use to build your team, like here's the designer, here's the program, here's all the different people to make your vision become a reality. It's not live yet, but it will be soon, hopefully, by the time you watch this video, it will be. But that's your job and your role as an entrepreneur. Hope that makes things a lot more simple when you actually see behind the curtains of what we're doing here inside of ClickFunnels. Thank you so much for watching.
