The number one question people ask me over and over and over again is how do you go from zero to a million dollars a year in just a year? I remember looking at pictures of famous artists who had gold records on their wall and I was like we need something for our people and that's where the idea for the Two Comic Club came from. They probably asked that because I'm one of the co-founders of ClickFunnels. I'm the guy on stage who's handing people these Two Comic Club awards. Two Comic Club awards means somebody sold over a million dollars inside of a funnel. And in the last few years I've been getting way over 2,300 of these awards. We've had a chance to literally coach thousands and thousands of entrepreneurs through this process. During this video in Milwaukee I was to do what is the step-by-step process someone would need to go through to go from startup to Two Comic Club award in the next 12 months. Now to begin this video I actually want to show you a clip from one of my friends Myron Golden he was speaking at our funnel hacking lab event and during that event he shared a principle with everybody that I was so powerful. He talked about what's harder is a harder to get rich quickly or harder to get rich slowly. Then you're on the board 25,000 dollars and said what if you made 25,000 dollars a year? You made 25,000 dollars a year it's going to take you 40 years to make a million dollars. Everybody say yes. Not only are you rich you're 40 times richer than the person who makes a million dollars over a 40 year time period. And see the amount of money is the same the only thing that changed was the time frame and all you did was to collapse those time frames so you made the same amount of money over a much shorter period of time. To make 25,000 dollars a year for 40 years you made a million dollars and this question was is that hard? Like yeah that's hard you spent 40 years of your life to make a million dollars but you made a million dollars are you rich? No you're not rich because it took you 40 years to do it. After Myers showed that let me show you what he said next. If you make a million dollars a month you're 12 times richer than the person who makes a million dollars a year. So what you've got to learn how to do is you've got to learn how to increase the speed at which you generate revenue. Does that make sense everyone? Yes? So I want you to start thinking about it from the standpoint of creating wealth through time instead of creating Now before I go too deep in this I want to share with you a number and this is my favorite number because most people they start with a goal like this and they don't really break it down but if you reverse engineer what the number is you have to make every single day becomes really easy. So if you take a million dollars and you divide it by 365 the magic number that pops out is once again my favorite number is $2,739.73. You got to make $2,739.73 a day every single day for 365 days and if you do that that equals a million dollars. So for every single day guys this should become your favorite number. You should like write it out post it on your sticky note next to your bed you should have inside the shower you should tattoo it to your arm or your forehead or whatever it is so you have that number in front of you every single day. Now we always remember that my goal today is how to make $2,739.73. If I do that every single day for a year boom you hit the million dollar goal. Most entrepreneurs when they get started the first question they ask is what kind of products should I create? What should I be selling to somebody? Right and they create a product and they launch it and sometimes the market doesn't want it sometimes they do sell but the wrong people buy it and they wake up one day miserable and how do I know that? I know that from personal experience. The very first business I launched I had ideas for products I was trying to be creative I created something I thought was going to be awesome when I create those products I started selling them and the people who were buying them were not the kind of people that I wanted to work with. I remember like every day doing the customer support and looking at their emails and their comments and it was just like it was like so frustrating I wasn't happy with the business I had built. In fact I remember laying there in bed one morning and like not wanting to get out of bed and I remember sitting there thinking like man I wish that I had a boss so they could fire him. The problem is that I was you know I was the business I started it and I was stuck with this thing. I remember finally getting out of bed that day and I thought man I did this whole thing wrong. The question I should have asked myself initially is not what do I want to create it should have been like who do I actually want to serve. So the first thing you have to figure out if you really want to go from zero to a million dollars quickly who is the person you're so excited about you wake up every single morning how can I help them what can I do for them what can I what can I create what do they want first when they want second right figure out who that who is everything else becomes so much easier. The cool thing is when you know exactly who it is you're going to serve you don't have to be creative you just go to those people like look what is it you're struggling with like what are the pains that you are feeling what are the frustrations you have. Literally for me if I'm going to go create a new business in a new market I go and I find where those people hang down online and I sit there and I listen. I look at their comments I read the blog post I listen to podcasts I listen to I get in the email list I go to the Facebook groups and I just start paying attention like what are the things they're struggling with when in a few minutes you start seeing like man everybody's frustrated because they can't figure out how to solve this problem or this problem or this problem and your job as an entrepreneur is not to be creative your job is to solve problems to make people's lives simpler okay and the better you get at making people's lives simpler the more money you're going to make. Now I figure out what they actually want to make oh my gosh they're struggling because they want this or they're looking for this or this is the gap in the market that they are trying to have solved and I can figure out how to solve that. Step number three then is for you to go out there to actually create that thing create the product create the service create the software create the supplement like whatever it is like your job's got there and create the thing that they want. This is one of the biggest problems a lot of business owners have when they first get started they're trying to figure out what they want to create and the reality is it's not so much what you want to create is what do the people want to actually buy. The market is the one who chooses and they vote with their credit card. I can't tell you how many times over the last 20 years of me doing this I have created things I thought the market was going to want I tried to sell to them and they didn't buy it. That's one of the most frustrating things you spend so much time building something and you launch it and it doesn't work nobody buys it. The key is just figure out what are they going to vote with their credit card and say yes I'm going to buy this thing that's what we got to figure out how to do. When you figure out the what and the how this is when businesses blow up literally overnight. Like I've seen of all the people who've come into our world who've tried to win a two comic cup award some people takes two three four years of trying thing after thing after thing and then one thing clicks and they go from startup to two comic cup winner in a matter of months. People just ask me like what was the thing what they do different and the thing they did difference they figured out these things. Who is it they actually want to serve what does the market actually want what are they looking for like what is the prom that they need solved today and then how do we sell it to them. And sometimes they figure out like this is what people want but they can't sell right they try a webinar their battle webinars they try to sell on phone their battle on phones and then they do a challenge and like that how is the key and also it blows up or maybe the house through membership site maybe the house through a book funnel or through webinar funnel like they gotta figure out like what is the mechanism that gets this dream market to give you money. You figure out the who the what and the how and those three things line up that's how you go and boom everything explodes for you very very quickly. A couple really cool examples of this one of my favorites is Jamie Cross. Jamie Cross she figured out her dream market she wanted to help people who want to live more naturally they don't want to be putting chemicals and things to their bodies that was her dream client right and she figured out what do they actually want for her they wanted soaps that weren't made out of water to actually dehydrate your skin but stuff made out of beeswax and things like that they were hydrating they were better for your skin. And then for her next was like how to actually sell it so she tried all sorts of things she went door to door initially they just went to farmers markets and she was selling stuff but it was very very slow for her to get to common comes she could have done it like Myron said over the next 20 30 years but she wanted to speed up that process and so she had to figure out how to do it. Eventually she came into our world and she started building out an actual funnel she built a funnel she launched it and the first funnel she built failed she tried to do a 90-minute webinar to sell soap it didn't work then she shrunk it to a 60-minute webinar to sell soap didn't work then she shrunk all the way down to a five-minute mini webinar to sell her soap she launched it and in less than eight months she went from zero sales online to 22 comic level work because she figured out the what. She had the who she had the what the soaps and as soon as she figured out the how everything changed for her and I can share example after example after example so my question for you is where are you in this process number one do you know what you want to serve if not that is the beginning spot okay if you can build this up do over here not having successions because you haven't figured out who it is you're actually serving it okay if you figure out the who the second question is like what is the actual thing you're selling if you don't allow yet now it's time to go back and figure out exactly what is your gonna sell this bill what do they actually want the most and figure that out and then number three now we gotta figure out how to sell it and you might want to need to try one funnel or two or three or something but if you keep trying it then should figure out the right one when you figure out those three things and you get them all lined that's when people go from startup to comic book winner almost overnight so I want to come back now to where I started this video again the goal is a million dollars in a year so if we reverse engineer that to do that we gotta figure out to make 2730 million dollars and 73 cents a day every single day for the next year so for you what does that look like is it creating a 27 hour ebook and selling 100 copies a day is that you make a hundred dollar course and selling 100 a day is you're making a thousand dollar course and selling three a day a 10,000 coaching program during two a week there's a lot of ways to package that but it's coming back to figure out what is the thing that you've got to do every single day to hit that goal because if you want to make a million dollars a year you know that every single day you got to be making sales consistently every single day and that's kind of where we begin with now my question for any of you guys who are watching this video who've already done that you got the two comic club you passed a million dollar mark what are the things you did every single day to make sure that you were able to get enough sales to hit that magic number of 2700 and thirty nine dollars and 73 cents a day let's know in the comments down below and then on top of that if you're getting started and this is your very first time like what are things you could be doing after your product's done you got out there you got something to start selling it through what are the things you have in mind you can use start getting yourself to spot where you can make those sales every single day as well and then if you're also interested let me know I can make a separate video in the future walking through all the things I do daily to make sure that my products are selling day in and day out because the worst thing is the day we are making any sales right right I guess those are worst things it'd be a lot worse things in life that was pretty bad I don't know where I'm going this is weird and here's some more outros from Russell not being as smooth as most people you see on youtube are they all just really good on camera or they just all hide their outros because I'm not as good as some of these guys I'm just a long time so what do you think
