The man, Russell. Pay to sell your product. Love this guy. I honestly believe the entrepreneurs are the only people that can actually change this planet. So this is it. This is the simplest but most powerful formula for success. If you understand this, everything else will become easy. And some of you guys will be like, this makes sense, Russell. I do this. You don't. Everyone that asks me, everyone comes with like a business problem. It's because they broke one of these three rules almost every time. Okay. Rule number one, you have to find a hot market. Gary Halbert, one of my early mentors, had a chance to interview him once before he passed away. But I remember him asking me during the interview, he said, hey, everything else equal. If you could have one thing against a competitor, what would it be? And I was like, oh, a better sales pitch. Oh, no, I want a better webinar. I want more attendees. I want more fit. You know, whatever. He's like, no, you're dumb. No, no. He's like, the only thing you need to be successful is a thirsty crowd. He's like, I can sell water for $100 a bottle if I've got a hungry crowd, a thirsty crowd. Like that's the big thing. So the first thing I forgot is you got to find a hot market. Okay. If you find a market that's not hot, it's going to be a painful process. Where's Joel at? Can I tease you? Okay. I'm going to tease Joel for a minute because he's good for it. He's good for it. So Joel joins our program. He's like, hey, man, I'm selling courses to engineers on how to become better people. I was like, do engineers want to become better people? He's like, I don't know, but I want to be better. So I'm an engineer. So he tried for like six months. He wasn't like he dabbled and gave up. Like he tried hard over and over and over and over again. He could have sell here and there. He's like, what should I do? I'm like, you should find a different market. He's like, no, but about my pitch. I'm like, dude, your pitch is perfect. Like your market just sucks. You change that becomes easy. So finally he, uh, he went and, um, part of a lot of friends, Jason, Jason had a product that was in a hot market. Really good thing, but wasn't very good at webinars. And Joel just spent the last six months perfecting webinars to the market who will not give money. And he still got someone to give him money, which is pretty impressive. He came and did his first webinar, makes insane amounts. Somebody crushes it and he's like, Russell, I killed it. I was like, what did you do different? He's like, I just found a good market. Like that was it. Step number two is you got to ask them what they want. We always assume that we know what our market wants. I'll show you some examples here in a minute, but we don't. And third step is after they told you what they want, you just give that to them. Not something else, not your book. You just wrote. You give them exactly what they want. Okay. So let me walk through this in a little more detail. Step one, find a hot market. I find the market I want to be in. No, I need to know everything about that market. People come, yeah, I found one guy selling something similar. I'm like, uh, in fact, this is, I won't say names, but someone recently came to me and they're like, in a market that I know really, I'm really familiar with. And they're like, Hey, this is the first question I asked is like, cool. So who else is doing this already that you can show me? And he's like, I only know about one guy doing it. I'm like, and it was in a real estate thing. I'm like, you only know one guy. I'm like, how about this guy? He's like, never heard him. This guy never heard. I knew off like probably 13 to 15 of the real estate gurus that I know that I'm friends with, never heard of any of their names. Like, dude, I don't even know that market. I know all the gurus. I know all the people. I know what they're selling. I know their business models. I know what they're like, I know everything. Like, how do you not know this? This is your market. Do your homework. So the first thing you're going to find out everybody who's already successfully selling what you want to sell. And some markets sometimes it might be hard because you might be like, man, no one in my market knows anything. So let's just say you can't find somebody in your market who's selling it. You have to find people who are selling how you want to sell. So if you know, like, I'm going to sell through a webinar. I'm going to sell through high ticket phone sales. I'm going to sell through a trip, whatever. If you figure out how you want to sell, you got to find people that could be in different markets but selling the way that you want to sell. Okay. This is key. Like, before I get into any new business, any new market, like I have done my homework. I've probably purchased 30, 40, 50 products. I funnel hacked them to see it. Not just funnel hacking the product. I'm going deep. I'm on the email sequences. I'm taking phone calls, I'm selling people. I'm trying to figure out like, what's behind the scenes? What's the next thing having? What are they doing? Because all those things matter. If you are in a market and you're an expert, you should be obsessed with this topic. You should be in every Facebook group already. You should be on everyone's email list. You should be buying people's products. Like, if you're not obsessed with this market already, you need to become that way. Because this stuff's already happening out there. If you go like 50 Facebook pages that are similar to the market you want, all of a sudden ads are going to start popping up all around you. In your Facebook account, you should go like as many millions of things you want. All of a sudden, all the ads will come to you and you'll know exactly what everybody's doing. And then click on the ads. Take screenshots of them. Okay. I got folders and folders of screenshots of the ads and the landing pages and the upsells and the downsells and the phone call. And like every single thing that's happening in this process, I'm watching. I'm recording because those things all come back. Okay. So it's very important. That's the first part. All right. Next thing. This is a very important rule. Only sell what people are buying. Russell, I got this new idea. No one's ever thought of it. It's going to be amazing. This is what it's going to do. No, no, no. What are they already buying? Sell that. We are all entrepreneurs who are so creative and want to do all these cool things. And I get that. But sell what people are buying. This is direct response marketing 101. You have to sell what people are buying. Okay. Seems stupid. Seems easy, but a lot of you guys aren't doing that right now. Okay. Next thing. Don't sell to broke people. Guess what broke people don't have. They don't have money. Guess what you want to have when you're in business? Money. Okay. We sell broke people. Guess what happens? A million headaches. Your life will be miserable. Okay. They will complain. They will whine. They're going to want their money back. When Christmas happens, 25% of them will ask for their money back. We call it the Christmas refund. It will make markets that people have money. It will change everything. Your life will become so much easier. People that have money don't mind spending money. Next rule of funnel hacking. Don't copy people. I've seen so many of my products to look like my products. Okay. This is not about copying. This is about seeing what people are currently buying and then building a better mousetrap. Okay. When we built ClickFunnels, guess what we saw? We saw lead pages. We saw unbounced. We saw optimized press. We saw a whole bunch of people out there selling something that was good. We came back and said, how do we make it great? Okay. Same thing with whatever business you're in. Don't copy. You're looking at what they're doing as an example of where to start. Okay. Your jobs make a better mousetrap. Make something that's great. If you do that, the people will come. Okay. Understanding their offers. I am real when I say buy people stuff. People are like, yeah, I funnel hacked four people. I'm like, cool. What was the back end? Why didn't buy it? Like, why not? Oh, I saw, you know, I know what they're doing. Like, no, you have to buy stuff. Understand their offering. I'm not just like, like when I buy a product, it's not just like understanding the process. That's part of it. Right? I want to see how, like, what were the words on the sales video they got, gets people to pull out a credit card and buy? How do they structure their upsell, their downsell? I want to go into the members area and see what the actual deliverables were. I want to understand that not because I'm going to copy it, because that's my baseline. That's where I start. I got to make something better. I got to go from good to great, but I can't know what good is until I've seen what it is. Right? And so I'm buying their products. I'm consuming the courses. I'm going through it. And you're going to find a lot of times you go through stuff like, man, this is horrible. But at least you know where the baseline is. Now you can make something great. The next rule, and this is a big one, before I ever create a funnel or an offer, anything ever, the very first thing I want to do is I want to make sure I know exactly where the traffic is. Can I tell you how many times people come to me like, hey Russell, I did everything. I made a funnel. The funnel's finished. This is awesome. Where should I get traffic from? I'm like, you're asking that question now? Like, that should have been the first question. Right? I want to know where, like, if I'm like, I think I want to make a weight loss offer. Before I even put forth any more effort, I got to find out when this thing is done, where is traffic at? What are the Facebook advertisement advertising on? What blogs? What social media? What email list? Kind of like, I want to know all those things ahead of time. And as soon as I say, there is traffic, the second my offer is done, this is where I will purchase traffic from, then I will go and build my funnel. Not the other way around. Those are some of the rules. A couple of things about market. Make sure you're picking markets that are irrationally passionate about the topic. All you guys in here, guess what you guys do for fun? The same thing you do for work, right? You guys are irrationally passionate about it. Okay, saying the happens in the fitness markets and health markets, like, look at the markets. If the market is not obsessed about where their work and their play is the same thing, it's usually not good to market to get into. When they're irrationally passionate, it means they're following people. They're building fan pages. There's communities. All these things are already happening and you can just tap into those sources. It becomes so much easier. Okay. Next thing, you got to make sure the people you are serving and you want to go after are both willing and able to pay. This goes back to selling to broke people, right? A lot of people are willing to give you money. Yeah, I'll give you money for that sweet. Hey, where's it at? Oh, I don't have any right now. They've got to be willing and able. Some people are able to pay like the engineers have money. Like these guys are all making good money, right? But they're not willing to back. This is my money. I'm not giving this to you. She had to find markets that people are both willing and able to pay. If they're not willing and able, don't go in that market. The next piece is to figure out like, where do you fit in this ecosystem of this market? Okay. Every market has an ecosystem. There's other people selling things to these customers, right? And the worst thing that you can do and a lot of us do this is we come in and right, okay, this is cool. That guy's killing. I'm going to sell something very, very similar. We come in and we start competing with people, right? The problem is when you start competing with people, it like dramatically, especially if you're the new guy in town, you lose access to this whole market. But if you figure out instead of how to compete, you figure out how to compliment. So like, here's this ecosystem that guy's teaching this, that guy's teaching this. Like, here's all these people doing things. Where do I fit this ecosystem? Like, what do I have that's different, that's unique that I can bring to the table? Where do you fit in that ecosystem? And if you can bring that and you can plug in, suddenly all these people that would have been your competitors can now and all become your partners. Okay. So it's a really big key. There's figuring it out. What makes you different? Where do you fit in this ecosystem that sets you apart? Okay. So that's something that was finding a hot market, okay? What should we change this planet?
