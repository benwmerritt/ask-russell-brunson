## Transcript
Hey everyone, this is Russell Brunson again, and I wanna welcome you back to part number two of my interview with the man, the myth, the legend, Mr. Tony Robbins. If you haven't watched the first part of the interview yet, go back up in the playlist and watch that one first, because you don't wanna not watch that before you get to part number two. Now, in the part number two, I'm excited for you, because in here, we start diving deeper into the different types of businesses, and I go through two types of businesses, and I call them two expert businesses. One of them is where you become an expert selling your own products, like I was a potato gun expert. Tony Robbins is the personal development expert, right? So there's that type of business, but the other side of it, which a lot of people don't know about, is let's say you already have a business, you're selling physical products on Amazon, or e-commerce things, or you have a gym, or maybe you are a chiropractor, a dentist, or financial planner, like if you have an existing business, you can also apply the expert strategies that Tony and I are gonna talk about next into your business. Now, on top of that, you're gonna learn a whole bunch of other things, like how do you create a tribe of people? What are the three commonalities in every single tribe, every mass movement that's ever been started from the beginning of time until now? What is the new opportunity? How do you create one in a whole bunch of other amazing things that you are gonna love? So with that said, let's jump into part two of the interview with Tony Robbins. In your book, you talk about the two types of kind of expert businesses, and people don't wanna be an expert also, but just wanna grow their company, how would this work for them as well? So maybe you can give us those differentiations so people haven't understanding how to kinda look at this. Yeah, definitely. So the first kind of expert business is one I think people are familiar with, is I look at you like you are the king of this, right? They're doing books and seminars and positioning yourself as an expert, and that's like a big piece of this, which is really, really cool, and I think anybody who's got any kind of talent or specialized knowledge or something they're passionate about can do that kind of business, and you can make great money, you can serve people. But I know there's a lot of people that come into my world that are like, well, Russell, I don't wanna do that. Like I own a software company or supplement company, or I'm a chiropractor, whatever those things might be. And it's interesting, like when I launched our software company, ClickFunnels, it's just a boring software company, and we're competing against other boring software companies. But I was able to take all these principles we teach in here and kind of attach like a person to a software company, and we took in it from no members to right now, actually today we passed 40,000 active members inside of ClickFunnels. I think one of the fastest growing non-VC-backed startups in the world is because these principles, like you take it and it takes any kind of business and lights it on fire. In fact, I've got a friend who's a financial planner, and there's how many financial planners, and boy, he's the Idaho where I'm at, there's a thousand of them here, but people come and they actually, they will fly over like 30 states to get to him, they'll pay him 10 times more, and he does the exact same thing because he's positioned himself as this expert. And we understand that, it's like, man, like you can charge more, you're no longer a commodity, people will come to you, you can serve people to a higher level, like so many cool things come when you understand how to wrap these principles into any type of business. Doesn't just have to be an expert business. Yeah, and I think, you know, positioning as an expert, you know, one of the things I love about what you do is you make sure the person is an expert. So tell me, what's the pattern that you started to discover? You talk about this in the book, that, you know, every mass movement really starts with, I think it was three patterns, if I remember correctly. Yeah, it's cool, because I was creating this book, and I'm just like, I learned this from you, I model everyone, right? So I'm like, okay, I'm building a software company, who do I model, who are the best out there? And I was looking at everything. Initially, I started with business, I look at like Apple and Steve Jobs, and I'm like, what did he do? And I started looking at like Tesla and Elon Musk, and then I started taking a step back, and I looked at politics, and like, what are the people that are winning, and what are the people that are losing? And then I took another step back, and I started studying everything from like, from like the really negative like cults, and how they work, and then religion, and everything in between, and it was cool. As I was going deep in the study, and I know you've done this before, you're going through stuff, and all of a sudden like, I started seeing this weird pattern, I was in a point of immersion, where I was like, for three or four weeks, just geeking out, and it was cool, as soon as I identified the pattern, then I started looking at our company, I was like, okay, we're doing parts of this, or maybe one or two things, but now that I know it, how can we amplify it? What are the things we can do to make it better? And so we started doing all those pieces, and then we test them, and then we'd see what would happen. So the book's kind of cool, because it gives you, and I'll show you in a second, they showed you the strategy, here's the three things they all have, and then it shows, here's the practical application, that what we did inside of ClickFunnels, we did these four things, and that's what got us from 20,000 members to 30,000, within like a three month period, what are those things? And so I'll show you guys, in my books, I'm a big doodler, because that's how my brain works. But like there's tons of sketches, like this is a sketch from this, so this right here, this is the three things that every mass movement from beginning time, all has had. I'll kind of go in real quick. The number one is all of them have some type of charismatic leader, and that's the big thing, because it's hard to connect with just a brand. Longer term you can do that, but initially especially, it's a person that you connect with that gets you to want to follow. The number two thing in the pattern is, all of them had like a future based cause, that they were taking people towards. And one of the coolest ways I found, and I talk about this, I went through all the US elections from, from the one that just happened all the way back to like George Bush, or all the way back to George Washington. And what's interesting is, I was able to find most of the campaign slogans on both the sides, like Republican or Democrat. And it didn't matter who won, what party, whatever, but the ones that won, all the candidates had like a very future based cause. Think about Trump was, let's make America great again, and all the people that lost had a very present based cause. Like Hillary had, I think hers, the two or three slogans I found, hers was like, I'm with her, and like very present based things. You look back when Obama won, Obama was all about change, and Bush was. And then like, it's interesting. And so I started realizing that. And so inside of our big mass movement, we were trying to create, I realized like, we need a future based cause. Like what is that? So we created one, and then we figured how to amplify it, and we show all the examples of how we've done that. And that gets people to want to come with you. And then the third thing, and this is probably the least understood, but I think the most important is that, is every mass movement, the leader offered their people a new opportunity, which is they didn't come and try to, try to just help people become better, but they were like, look, this is a new opportunity I wanted to. I was just trying to find, so a lot of people don't make that, I don't sound simple, but how do you find a new opportunity in your mind? Yeah, so there's. So many people, so many people take something that currently exists, and they convert it into seemingly a new opportunity. I'm just curious, but your definition. So for me, I look at like, whatever customer we're trying to serve, right? They're coming to us and they want a result. So yeah, this is the result I want to get over here. And usually we're not the first person they came to. Like usually there's, they've been trying to get this result for a while, for a while, and they're in some vehicle, and I like visualized it as a vehicle. They're in a car, they're in a vehicle to drive to get that result. And so what most people do in business is they come and they sell what I call an improvement offer. So they'll come and like, oh, that vehicle you're in, well, it's like, let me set it back. So an example, let's say you're in the weight loss, let's say you want to lose weight. So the vehicle that you might be in, let's say it's the Atkins diet, or if it be whatever diet, right? That's the vehicle and they're in that thing. And so an improvement offer is coming back, and what most people do is like, hey, you're in this thing, I'm going to make that experience better for you. And we're going to, whatever, they try to make it better. But the hard thing is that, is that someone knows what that experience is like. They're in this vehicle trying to get the result and they're not happy, like, they're not happiness. No matter how hard we try to make that process better, it's going to be, you're always going to have tons of friction. Whereas if I can say, look- I'm going to compare you to them, even if you're different. Yeah, exactly. So if I can come and I can create an actual new opportunity and say, look, get out of that vehicle you're in, get in that result, come over to this vehicle, it's completely different. It's a new opportunity. This is what's going to take you over here. That's how it causes these huge changes. One of my favorites, a friend, you and I both have Dave Asprey. He came in with his movement and he's like, look, you're going to eat high-fat, put butter in your coffee, all sorts of things. And people are like, what in the world? I was going to hurt that description before you told him he was nuts. The market, he's been on that, so genius. So brilliant. And everyone's jumping from their vehicles coming to here because I don't know what they're doing, that sounds way better. And they come over and he's built a huge mass movement, huge company, self-employment company, retail stores, everything based on this new opportunity he provided people. And it was brilliant as you know. Hey, this is Russell again. Thank you so much for watching part two of my interview, Tony Robbins. How crazy is it that Tony interviewed me?
