We're gathered here today to celebrate the death of your website! Peewew! Congratulations! So happy for your loss? Oh, my website's not dead. It might as well be. It's a deadbeat that never makes you any money. Amen! As a professional gold digger and part-time grave digger, I think you could do better. In fact, you could be making six times the gold. I'll prove it. Here's your website. A confusing maze of distractions and dead ends. ClickFunnels, on the other hand, is a series of online steps that guides the customer through the sale. What happens when real business owners compare the selling power of their website to a ClickFunnel? I give you the ClickFunnel test. Each business owner sent the same number of potential customers to their website and their ClickFunnel. ClickFunnels won every time, capturing more leads and making more money. It worked for a dentist, blogger, speaker, gym owner, business consultant, and it can work for you. Go to deathofawebsite.com and sign up for a free web class that'll teach you the ClickFunnel secrets to grow your business. On average, business owners who ditch their website for ClickFunnels have made over six times the money. Imagine the money you make right now, and then six of it. If you can't do the math in your head, just imagine a lot of money. Look, it's not your fault your site doesn't sell. It's not your team's fault either. Except for you, Kevin. You suck at business. The problem is that websites aren't designed to make money. Whether they're pretty but pointless or cluttered and confusing, websites fail because they don't guide the customer to the sale. My grandmother used to embroider this on pillows in the 80s. It sounded senile at the time, but in hindsight, probably shouldn't have put her in the home. Luckily, there's a website alternative, an upper hand that your competitors do not have. It's time for your business to use ClickFunnels. The effective, no coding way to six times your sales. Unlike websites, ClickFunnels are designed around proven sales principles. They guide potential customers through the sale just like you would in person. Turning them from casual visitors into happy buyers. That means more leads, more sales, more money. It's like having a great salesman who works 24-7 for no pay. Hey, that sounds like me. Shut up, Kevin. You get paid an experience. Don't believe an intellectual like myself. Well, how about an incredibly average person named Russell? Hi, I'm an incredibly average person named Russell.
