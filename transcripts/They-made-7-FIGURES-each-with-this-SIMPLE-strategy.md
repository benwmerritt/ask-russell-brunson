Like let's say this guy's awesome, this guy's awesome, but this guy actually treats customers like crap. Guess what happens to all of your shared customers? The man, Russell! So anyone in Frank Kern's groups? So apparently he told me, and he texts me every single time he says it, everything the bad that happens to every single marketer in every single business, he tells them to blame it on Brunson. So apparently there's a hashtag, blame it on Brunson. So if you're at a counter just shut down, you blame it on Brunson. If you're not making up money, you blame it on Brunson. And he like laughs at it and sends me a link every single day, every time he says something like that. So I feel justified stealing his content. So there you go. No, I asked him if I could share this with you guys and he said yes. It's powerful. This takes like this dream 100 concept and everything to a whole nother level. Okay, so I'm going to explain the best I can and what this concept is. It's called creating your syndicate. So for you to understand the concept of a syndicate, there's a couple of core foundational pieces you got to understand. The very first thing is you have to understand one of the problems that all of us have is we have this this misguided belief that our customers are customer, right? I'm the only person. And so we have this like protective barrier. It's like they're just my customer, right? And so the problem like to make this work, you have to understand like your customers not just your customer, right? And so you start thinking about that. The second thing I start thinking about and stuff we've talked about earlier today, you look at your you look at your customer. All of our customers are going through this customer journey, right? And so you're thinking about this like when somebody comes into my world and they're buying funnels, it's usually not the first thing that they're learning about, right? Like I'm not really like the front end person, right? So my customers coming into this world, who are the like where are all the places this is happening? Who are the people and then what's the structure, right? What's the very first thing that they are being exposed to and introduced to, right? They might have learned how to make an online course. Maybe it's like run a Facebook ad, right? What's the product or the service or the person they bought from initially that brought them into this world? Who's targeting and focusing on the beginners, right? And I look at my dream 100 and I'm like, okay, this is that person they're doing like this person is focusing on beginners, right? So like Stephen Larson, for example, has been focusing on more on like the beginner side of the market. It's like showing network markers how to use funnels. I'm like, cool, have those customers. After you've convinced them funnels are great, seeing the world over here. I want to take them and convince them to shift network marketing to like changing the world, right? Then after that, then what's the next phase? Who are all the people in this customer's life journey that they're going to be learning from, right? Every single step before me and then also the steps after me, okay? And so I'm mapping that. I'm looking at who are the actual people that are selling those things. And so I'm making this like timeline of my customer's experience and I map it out and have all these people here, right? Like we're trying to build a syndicate. And the way the syndicate works starts right here. Understanding like we're all serving the same customer, right? And we all want this customer to have a great experience and succeed, right? But what if we came together and figure out how can we actually serve this person in a more holistic way? If you understand that and realize, man, how can we serve this person the highest level? Let's all come together. And so what happens? You take these people, you take them around your customer. You said right now, if you think about it, each of these people is already marketing directly to this customer anyway. So we should create some kind of relationship of a syndicate where we're also helping each other this way. This is how it works. Have you guys remember watching? This is probably, man, five or six years ago when every single month there was a launch between Frank Kern, Ryan Dice, Jeff Walker, like it was this thing that was kind of crazy, right? You guys remember this? Those two men in the industry. So what happened, the precursor of this is they did this thing to explain the full concepts. They said, look, this is the deal. Mike Phyllsen, you target the beginners, right? Everyone needs your stuff so they can get into business. Then you make the first dollar in line. After they've done that, the next thing is their persuasion. So I'm persuasion guy, then Ryan Dice is the traffic guy. And then we've got Jeff Walker is the product launch guy. And we have four or five people and I think they had six people in their syndicate, right? Instead of us all this marketing against each other and fighting all the stuff, then what if we came together and we figured out a launch calendar and we said, okay, look at this. This is our customer trying to serve them. How about this? In January of the year, Mike Phyllsen's folks on the beginners. What if all of us promoted Mike's thing and got everybody on the same foundations about Mike's thing? March, we'll do the next person, which is like, okay, now they've got a business started. Now they need, they need traffic or they need their funnel, whatever, right? And then March for you this and then two months later, everyone does this and two months later, everyone does this too much later. And so throughout the calendar year, everyone's got a coordinated launch where all of the biggest people in the market who all have the customer base are all focusing on serving that customer. The first step and then the second step and the third step and the fourth step and the fifth step and so on and so forth. Okay, if you watched what happened over the next three years after they launched the syndicate, these guys literally sucked up the entire market. For those who are around in that time, you probably have never seen it, right? Every two months, there was new launch, everybody talked about it and like you, all you saw in the marketplace was everyone talking about this person's launch and every launch they did like on the low end of a million high end, five or $6 million every single one. Okay. And so if you really want to take this Dream 100 strategy to the next level, you really want to dominate all the conversation in the marketplace. It's hard to do by yourself, right? So find the partners, find the people and then building out a syndicate kind of like this. And now you got a whole bunch of people they're working very, very close with to serve this customer at the highest level. Now one thing I'd be really, really careful of, if any of the people you pick in here happen to be like a bad person, like let's say this guy is awesome, this guy is awesome, she's awesome, but this guy actually treats customers like crap. Guess what happens to all of your shared customers? They're like, oh my gosh, this whole thing's a scam and that customer leaves the ecosystem for forever. So I want to make sure you're aware that because one bad apple inside of a syndicate can destroy your whole entire process. You can get people to flee your marketplace and can be really, really damaging, right? So make sure if you decide to do something like this, you're picking these people strategically to build it out. And that you guys is how you do the syndicate, which is the second phase of the Dream 100.
