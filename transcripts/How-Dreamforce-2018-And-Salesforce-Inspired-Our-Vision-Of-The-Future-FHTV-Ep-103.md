Good morning everybody, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome to Marketing Seekers Podcast. Today I am streaming from the Golden Gate Bridge. I am out right now in San Francisco, obviously, at Salesforce's big huge event. It's called Dreamforce. When we decided to come out here, every kid asked me, why are you guys, why are you going to Salesforce's event? What's the point of it? And so I wanna kinda tell a story to understand why we're here and hopefully help you guys as well. So. Ladies, welcome, Chairman and Co-CEO, Salesforce, Mark Seneon. We are all moving forward. We're moving into the fourth industrial revolution. We're moving from the first revolution of scheme to the second revolution of electricity. We moved into the third revolution with computers. Now we're in the fourth revolution. The Salesforce event is here. Super excited because for our kids, the first time we've ever met is here. Super excited because Photo Hacking Live every year keeps getting bigger and bigger. This year we're gonna have 5,000 people. But Salesforce, this is like, they have 170,000 companies coming to San Francisco. All of San Francisco shuts down like. Tomorrow night, my friend right here is gonna play for his baby. Have you heard of him? He's Bay of Metallica. Yeah. It's insane. What is the bedroom? I want like some either vegan food or some bacon. We want some green drinks. We're in California, so we're all hippies to eat. So we gotta eat some hippie cool food. So I've been in San Francisco this is my second time. First time is at this event that Todd and I were sharing a hotel room because we didn't have any much money. We're talking about like the big idea. We're talking about like the big idea. We're talking about like the big idea. We're talking about like the big idea. We're talking about like the big idea. We're talking about like the big idea. That was the precursor to ClickFunnels. It was called WP Undies. And we got a logo designed. It was the WordPress logo wearing little tidy whitey undies. And that was the big idea that later became ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels was a better idea though. Why do you hate money? It's one of our mini brunsonisms. Whoa! You okay? Oh man. I'm dying. We ran meetings out of Dan's story on video about last year with that cubit. He texted us and we're in the middle of a party meeting. He's like, hey I'm in a room with a hundred people at Mark Cuban. Like what should I ask him? And so as a joke I text back. I'm like ask him what it would take to get Bob for a billion dollars. He's just totally joking. So I was like, okay let's do this. Because like the room's full of like dudes in suits. And I'm okay. The other thing you forget is I'm the one guy in the room wearing a Hawaiian shirt. And dude comes over, taps me on the shoulder, hands me the mic. And I'm like, oh my god I'm the last question. Wearing a Hawaiian shirt and I'm supposed to ask how we get bought by a billion dollars. And if Tony were to own either executive vice president's sales. I'm like, alright let's do this. I kind of like set it up with this little story. Like we haven't had any funding and we just hit our first hundred million dollars. How do we get bought, how do we take it to the next level and get like sales force to buy us for a billion dollars. And that was how I set it up. To Mark Cuban. Yeah, to Mark Cuban. Everyone in the room laughs. He thinks it's awesome. Unfortunately his answer was a total dodge and he just gave me this like BS like, oh son's like you guys are doing everything right. You don't need my help. And I was like, what? Way to leave me hanging. After Dreamforce, with Mark Cuban, you're right. It's amazing what you have done. This is a celebration of you, our trailblazers. This is Takeover San Francisco on Salesforce. It's like Dreamforce takes over the city. One of the best secrets about live events is going with the right people. We came to Salesforce. We knew that if a bunch of introverts came, it would be really awkward. We'd be all excited and we'd go hide in our rooms. We are the introverts here on the team. So I have my extroverted half, which is Dave. Dave goes out, kills things and brings it back to me. And I'm like, oh cool. Todd's got his extrovert, who's Ryan, who's actually out killing something right now. What's up my man? You wanna film me? Come on, come on. Here we go. I'm dying when the weather is hot. You can just light up the fire. It's dying when the weather is fine. You got women, you got women in your mind. Have a drink, have a drive. Go out and see what you're gonna find. Get those flowers. We're in the Cabela's and Salesforce right now. We're in the Trailhead. So Trailhead is where the beginning of the Salesforce Success Path. And this is all different classes and work stops and stations to help you to go have success as a customer. There's 2700 presentations that happened during this weekend. And there's one up right now that customizes page density and Salesforce Lightning Design System. Not as exciting as funnels, but... To be noticed in the design of everything, the branding, the feeling in here is kind of like this cool, like you're actually at a campground. When you walk by stuff, you can hear like there's birds chirping and water falling down. The ambiance is amazing. Now we're back to convention space. Salesforce San Francisco. So Salesforce is bought this company right here for six and a half billion dollars earlier this year. So it's some chump change laying around. And they got that's the size of their booth. So MuleSoft is software that helps take data from one spot to the other. So they bought them for six billion and now MuleSoft is the character that made them. So the Mule out, you buy the company, you make a character, animate it, and then now it's got a big old booth showing how MuleSoft works. Oh man, this is not Russell. He's a doctor at this point. Are you kidding me, dude? Dude. Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! It's in the house, dude! Russell, Russell, I'm practicing the perfect webinar as we speak, dude. Watch this guy buy the big difference. I just, I worship this guy. This guy's like the best market in the world. Kudos. Seriously. God, where were we? How much do you think that booth is right there? 50 grand. 40. 100 thousand dollars. Okay, so if you look at the math, you're like one, two, three, four. There's a million dollars that row. A million dollars a row. Each aisle. And these are the little baby booths. There's some big booths back here that are like... So that's the booth space because we're probably all in 800,000. So we should just buy the million dollar booth next time just to be like, take that IBM. All you know we should have is a funnel that's also a slide so you can go down and just have just a little ride. What's going on? I don't know. So we started at 28 miles away from Stripes headquarters. We walked around for about 20 minutes and now we are 1.1 miles away from Stripes headquarters. So it's not working out too well. And I should probably look not down at my phone. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Hey, Russell, nice to meet you. Sales horse! This is it? This is 16 inches off. Alright, so Tony Robbins told me there's two ways to build the tallest building in town. Number one is actually to build the tallest building in town. And number two is to knock down all the other buildings around you. So right now that one's really big. I'm jealous. I'm not going to lie. I've been saying this for hours and saying but even the lobby is like it's wrapped in LED walls. Alright, we found out how much this building actually cost to build. What's the guess? We all know. $1.1 billion to build this building. They just put their cloud on every building like... All these buildings there? Holy! Is it? Why else would it have a huge logo on the side of it? Sales force transit center. You have your own like metro station. Dude, that's insane. Whoa. ClickFunnels Transit Center. We'll funnel you to wherever you need to go. That's right. So, sales force is the biggest company in my world, right? I think they said last year they did $13 billion in sales. My little funnel hacking live that I thought was so cool and so big is tidy in comparison. As we were talking about coming out here and thinking if we should come, I remembered a story that I thought was really important. So, when I got started wrestling, there was the state tournament. My dad took me to the state tournament and I remember sitting up in the stands and watching the people in the state of Utah, the best of the best, wrestling and competing. I remember seeing them watching and I was like, oh my gosh, there's these guys from my high school who won a state title. I remember going back home and I was like, I want to be a state champ. I said that as my goal, I said that as a target, I started going and started running, started moving. Fast forward now a couple years, well, I won the state title. And it was awesome. It was amazing and everything. And in college, I never went to the NCAA tournament. I never went to the Nationals. I never saw those things, right? I had as a goal, I was like, I want to be a national champ. But I never actually seen it. I missed my goal every year. I actually had a friend, he was like, his dad used to always take the national terms because he didn't care about being a state champ. He just wanted to be a national champ. He was going to be trying to be a national champ. I remember thinking, gosh, like, because I never had seen the national term, I didn't even know what it looked like. It's hard to run towards something you haven't seen. And so fast forward now until this event, right? Last year, a bunch of guys from my team came out and they were telling me, it's a whole different level. And as they were telling me about it, I was like, oh my gosh, that's the next level. I need to go and witness and I need to go see it just like I would go to the national tournament. Because as soon as I see it, then I can like, it becomes real and I got a goal, right? But when you start thinking, I want you to open your vision of like, what's the platform I could create, right? In fact, a little while ago, we were doing the math on how many jobs have been created because of ClickFunnels and it's fascinating. Like, there's like the jobs of our employees, right? And then there's the jobs of all the 65,000 customers, all their employees. And there's like, then the extra jobs, there's the copywriters, the designers, the programmers, the, like all the other things. And like, a conservative guess of about 250,000 jobs have been created because of ClickFunnels. We've created a whole ecosystem of people, right? And it's funny because coming in yesterday, I was a little intimidated. But after sitting in that room with, I don't know, 5,000 other businesses and watching Mark Benioff deliver his keynote, seeing the people, seeing the software, seeing the innovation, seeing the ecosystem, seeing all this stuff. I was watching it, I was like, this is just another tournament. Like, it's on a bigger stage, but I can compete at this level. Like, I wish I would have seen this five years ago because I would have shifted everything. I would have had more belief when you believe you can actually accomplish, right? You create something like this, we could do it, we can do it. Like, the path has been trodden for us. The first lesson is for you is to go see, like, whatever you're aspiring to become like, go and find that and like, experience it so you can see it. So it's not the scary, weird thing, but like, can do it. Like, that's what it is. Like, I can do that. Alright guys, with that said, my fingers are frozen. I'm going to go and watch the sunrise here. You guys have taken this company to a whole other level. Like, I know that there are companies that are bigger and make more money, but this is a family owned business and like, although you guys aren't related, you guys have always treated each other as if you're brothers. I think that whatever you guys touch your mind to, it absolutely can happen. You don't have to hook me on it. You guys are all in agreement with, like, I will be the cheerleader and I'll say, rah, rah, both click, but I'll wear the t-shirt. I will trash talk lead pages. I ain't even gonna say that. So it's the last day, we've been here a couple days and we decided to go on a walk and talk and just kind of brain dumb. It's been so cool because there's all these businesses who started like us. Like, we went to Stripe, right? We saw this company that was an idea that somebody had. We saw Voxer, we saw Optimize, we saw all these companies, tech companies in our same space, doing amazing things and just helped us to see the vision of like, what's actually possible. Like, I think sometimes we're in our bubble where we're in Boise or in our hometowns. We don't see like, we don't see what happens in the tech capitals of the world like this and you see something like this, you're like, oh my gosh, this is what's possible. How many more people could we serve when we have infrastructure like this? And now we know and we've seen like the other side of that, I guess we pumped. We're excited to head back home, start implementing some of the stuff with my ideas. Can't show them to the community yet, but you'll see them and I promise you're gonna love it. So, let me know which adventure you're planning going to and we can meet up at down in the comments below. Subscribe, but that's it, I'm gonna get some sushi and we're heading to Metallica.
