## Transcript
Hey everyone, my name is Russell Brunson and in a few seconds from now I'm going to actually show you an interview recently I did with my friend Tony Robbins and I talking about how to start a business online. But before we get into the interview, in case we haven't met yet, I just want to introduce myself. My name is Russell Brunson. I started a software company a few years ago called ClickFunnels.com. You may have heard of it. This year, I did over $100 million in sales, which is kind of crazy. But this interview with Tony was all about you and how can you start a business online? And what a lot of people don't even know is that when I got started initially, the first thing I sold, I talked about it with Tony, was the DVD teaching people how to make potato guns. Yes, potato guns like this. And so that's how I got started, selling things like this. So for you, it doesn't matter what you're selling. If you have a product, an idea, a service, something, this interview is going to help you understand how to actually sell your products and services online, which is exciting. Now this is the first of a three-part video series. Each part is going to walk through part of this interview with Tony. And the first part you're going to learn about how I got started and how you can get started as well. You're going to hear stories about people like Brandon and Katelyn Polin who were just like you initially didn't have a business, but they were excited. And now they've launched this huge company that sell products internationally all around the world. You can hear some of those stories during this interview. So I'm excited for you. I hope you love this. You're going to learn all the tools and techniques you need to start your own business online and how I've done it. And you can have Tony actually interview me about the whole process, which is a ton of fun. So with that said, let's roll the video and check out the first part of the interview. I've known Russell for about, I think about 15 years, 14, 15 years now. I've gotten to know him really well over the last decade or so. And what I love about Russell is, you know, so many people are looking for ways to maximize the business or to find a way to produce a secondary income. And most of the stuff that you see online is disappointing would be the nicest word I could give for it. There's so many scams. There's so much BS. And what I love about Russell, the reason I wanted to introduce him to you briefly today is he has a new book out called Expert Secrets. Sometimes it helps you find your message, build the tribe and change the world. He has told that out so we all see that. There it is. And it just, what I love about Russell is just he's the real thing. Why don't you share with my audience a little bit here about how you got started in this business and a little bit of your approach to how it differs from so many other people out there. Yeah. So I actually got started in this business. It's been, feels like yesterday, but it's been, you know, 10, 15 years now. And it's funny because I was the same way a lot of people were. I didn't know a lot about business. I was trying different things and learning from different mentors. And one of the very first things I ever created, in fact, I sent you the first one I made actually was a potato gun. And we're making those for fun. And we had so much from making potato guns and shooting them and having just like the time of our life. And then one day I had the idea like, I wonder if anyone else besides me is interested in information about potato guns. And there was nobody else selling any plans or DVDs or anything. And so I thought there's my first opportunity. I'm going to become a potato gun expert. We went and made a potato gun DVD. My friend and I recorded it, put it online and started selling it. And it never made me rich, but it was the first thing I sold online. We started making the $20 or $30 a day. And it was like the coolest thing in the world. And to see people like take what you knew and actually do something with it. And that's for me, it's how it began. And then obviously I didn't want my rest of my life to be known as a potato gun expert as much fun as that is. And I'm still into that business or into that, that hobby. But that's how it kind of began. And then I started branching out. And kind of my next steps, I started finding other people who were really good. And I was like, man, these are like one of my friends. I don't know if you know Howard Bergen, the world's fastest reader. We partnered with him and I was like, you're the world's fastest. Let's create information. Like selling what you do. And we did projects together selling his information and other people's. And I started getting obsessed with helping other people to take what they knew and what they were good at and put it out there and sell it. And then out of the most recent years, obviously we've been teaching a lot of people doing that. We've got software that helps people with it. But that's kind of the back story. Well, you've grown so massively. You've got a service. Have you served almost a million business owners in the last 10 years? Yeah, we've been over that now. Yeah. That's amazing. And you've created quick finals. We'll talk about it as well. But tell me about how do you differentiate yourself from so many people online? Everybody on the line jumps online. Everybody's got some hook that they're trying to use to sell somebody something. You really differentiate yourself. I've found over the years. What do you think has separated you from the others? I think a lot of people get into business initially because they want to make money, which is a good thing. That's usually spurs entrepreneurship. But for me, what I found, I talk about this action in the very first section of the book to kind of give people context because I know sometimes people feel guilty about that as well. But I know for me, I was learning. I was growing. And there came a point in my life where no matter how much I kept learning, eventually you kind of stop. It's hard to keep progressing just by learning itself. And I had some big wins. I had successes. And I was like, I love celebrating them. Then the first time I started helping other people, I was like, hey, the stuff I've learned, let me help you with it. And I'd help people and they'd see their success. And I'm sure you're the same way. Like when you see someone else have success, it is a million times cooler than your own success. And for me, I got addicted to that. I'm like, OK, that was awesome. Like who else can help and how else can I help? And my whole focus shifted from like, how do I start a business, make money? It's like these people have messages. They've got things that they know that they can change other people's lives. And I might not be the world's fastest reader. I might not be someone who's good at personal development or finance or any of those things. I might not be the best there. But if I can, like my gifts, my tools, if I can help them to get their message out, man, like how many more people can we impact? And so that's why I love working with entrepreneurs because it's like one entrepreneur can change hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of people's lives. And it's just it's so much fun. What's been one of the biggest campaigns that you've run to give people a sense of what the economic opportunity is? And then I want to follow up and get into a little bit about the different types of you know, expert businesses. But tell us a story of one of what's been one of the big surprises. I know the potato guns where you started, but what one of the big hits you've got? What kind of return did you get? Just to give people a sense of what's possible. And I remember you telling me how crazy you were over several of these stories. We give you one. So many cool ones. So I'll share one of one of my favorite there. They're a younger couple. They are I think 22-23. They just got married, Brandon and Kaylin. In fact, when you spoke at our event, she was one of the Prada person you kind of teased. Oh, yes. I remember that. So she's the coolest couple, the newlywed couple. And the first time they met me, they messaged me and they're like, we're completely broke. We have nothing. Someday we're going to be a success story. And I was like, all right, cool. And then a year later, they came to our event and they came up to me and they're like, hey, right now we're doing, I think it was 80 grand a month right now, helping women to transform their bodies to weight loss. And I was like, that's cool. And then they started going deeper and deeper into this. And one of my favorite things is they did a Facebook Live two months ago, following kind of the process we teach in this book. They did the Facebook Live and went live and two things. Number one, that Facebook Live they did, they sold over a million dollars with the products, 22, 23 year old couple. And number two, right now they're adding 500 women a day or coming into their programs and they're taking these women's lives and radically transforming them. And the case stays are just insane. So for me, it's like the money's cool because a son entrepreneur just want to know that. But like 500 women a day, every single day are coming in like clockwork into their programs. And they're having this huge impact on people's health that it's like the coolest thing in the world to watch and to see. Well, the crazy thing is so many people have beautiful ideas. I knew early in my career, my biggest thing was I had these skills, these abilities and talents, certain things, God gives you certain things you develop along the way. And but I realized my ideas were going to die in my lips unless I learned how to market. You know, I was not going to change millions of people's lives unless I could figure out how to do that as well. And you know, mine was so much trial and error and there was no internet per se. That's an age and I am. Hey, this is Russell again. I hope you enjoyed the first of the three part interview with Tony Robbins.
