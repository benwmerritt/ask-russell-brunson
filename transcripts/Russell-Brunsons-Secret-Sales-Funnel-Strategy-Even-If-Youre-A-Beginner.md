Hey, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome back to my YouTube channel. I'm so excited to have you here today. In today's video, I'm gonna be talking about a secret funnel strategy that's literally taking new business owners from startup phase to two comic club winners in a very short period of time and that's what we're gonna be talking about. But before we get into the training, really quick I wanna make sure that you are subscribed to my channel. If you're not yet, click on the subscribe button and also click on that little bell. That way you're notified when new videos are coming out. All right, so with that said, I wanna share with you guys this funnel strategy. If you know anything about me, my name's Russell. I own a company called ClickFunnels and I'm obsessed with sales funnels. What is a sales funnel? A sales funnel is a simple, easy way to sell stuff online. We start figuring out how to use it and make selling stuff online so easy. So this is the big secret funnel strategy. What we do is we use a concept called funnel hacking. So what that means is you can find people online who are making thousands or millions of dollars online. Let's say they have a sales funnel. Let's say page one looks like this. Maybe on page one they have a headline and they ask for your email address and the submit button. From there, they take you to page number two where they're selling something. Maybe there's a video up top and maybe there's some headlines down here and then there's a big order button. From there you're taken to a page that has an upsell. It's called upsell. There's a video with an upsell with a page and then from there it takes you to a member's area with a whole bunch of cool stuff. You guys have seen this before. If you've ever bought anything online, you've gone through a sales funnel. But a lot of times we look at a sales funnel and we buy the thing, oh, that's really, really cool. But what I want you to do is I want you to slow down next time you buy something and look at the process. We call this funnel hacking. Look at what happens on page one and page two and page three and page four. These funnels are not just made by happen chance. There's people like me who are obsessed, who geek out on us all day, every single day and every single piece is like art. So when you start looking at that, you say, okay, what did this company do? Like let's say there's a company online who's selling supplements and they're doing really, really well and they're selling things and you look at the sales process and say, okay, let's say they're selling this and on the homepage there's a bottle of this but they have, you know, on the upsell they're selling more bottles and over here they're selling something different. Now if you're selling a supplement, you can look at that as a business model. Okay, I look at funnels as models. I like to funnel hack something, I buy their product, I look at what it looks like and then from there you can map out your business model saying, okay, when I build my funnel, I know that I'm gonna need a page like that as well. Okay, now they're selling maybe, let's say it's a keto supplement or they're selling a supplement about for dogs or whatever it might be. Like I look at that and say, okay, how would I change it? Like I'm not gonna copy anything but I'm gonna model it, right? I'm gonna model the look and the feel and the layout. So I look at that and say, okay, what's my headline gonna be? And I'm gonna ask for an email address as well. And then from here I'm gonna look at the second page and obviously they have their sales video but I'm gonna put my sales video there. Okay, and then I'm gonna have my copy. I'm not gonna copy anything but I'm gonna model the layout of things, right? So I model the layout. Now look at the upsell and I model the layout of that as well and I model every single piece of the process, right? I think a lot of times people who are trying to start a business online, they struggle because they're trying to be creative and trying to figure out a business model and a business plan. People submit to me all the time, like here's my business plan, Russell's like 500 pages and I'm like, but do you even know what you're selling and how you're selling it? Okay, the hardest thing about making money online is figuring out what you're selling and how you're selling it. And the best way to figure out how to sell it is to look at someone else who's selling something similar. Look at their sales funnel, funnel hack it. Look at it, map out what it looks like and then now you know what you need to build. This is your business model. I always tell people that like, if they wanna submit a business model to me, this is what I wanna see. What is gonna be on your landing page? What's gonna be your sales page? What's on the upsell? What's on the downslide? What does that look like? And then you go back and you create it, okay? And that's what funnel hacking is. That's what the whole secret funnel strategy is. They want you to share with you. It's getting people from start up phase to two comic club winners practically overnight. Now I'm gonna be doing a live training this week.
