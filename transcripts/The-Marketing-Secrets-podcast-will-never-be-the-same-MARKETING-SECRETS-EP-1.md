## Transcript
What's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson. I am actually podcasting today to announce the death and the rebirth of the Marketing Secrets podcast. All right, that may have sounded kind of dramatic and it is, but actually in a really, really good and exciting way. When I first started this podcast, my business was on top of the world. We had like 60 employees, we had sales teams and marketing. I thought it was the greatest thing in the world and then everything crashed and collapsed. But for some reason I felt this pulled like you should start doing this podcast. And so Gary Vee talked about documenting your journey, but that's literally what I was doing was documenting the journey of us rebuilding our company. Man, it was like the most amazing, for me, like the most amazing time of discovery of my life. And I remember I was like, Marketing Secrets is like, for me, is this an umbrella brand of like all of the content stuff we're doing. And then I've done three, four, five hundred episodes of the Marketing Secrets podcast and it's been fun. But if I'm completely honest, over the last little bit, it's been more mature. It's been, you know, my brother messaging me like, Hey, we have podcast episodes. I need two this week. And like, Oh, like, what am I going to talk about it? And that's what brings us to where we are today. Hey, this is Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the YouTube channel. This episode is actually taken from a longer form podcast. I have been shifting my podcast. This episode will actually talk about why we're doing it. And it's going to be longer form episode talking about the transition, which you guys have a chance to see here as well on the YouTube channel. So it's a little longer form video, but I hope you enjoy these. If you do enjoy it, please comment down below. We're going to be watching the comments. I'll be using those comments for future episodes of the podcast. But that's the thing. You guys so much for listening and I hope you enjoy this very first episode of the marketing secret show. You're listening to marketing secrets with your host, Russell Brunson. So me as know when I first started this podcast, the podcast is free and all you got to do is subscribe to iTunes. Man, almost a decade ago, which is crazy. And what's even crazier is even probably seven or eight years before that. I remember podcast and became the cool thing. I'm sitting at Armourmore and big seminar in Atlanta and they had some speakers come up and talking about this weird thing called podcasting. And everyone in the audience was so excited. I was like, that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard of. I own the podcast. I'm never going to say the word podcast. It's embarrassing. And then my buddy, I remember Josh Anderson was my friend who was there at the time with me and he's like, no, like this is the future. And I was like, well, if I'm ever going to do a podcast, I'm going to call it marketing in your car. So remember, I bought marketing in your car.com. And then the guy who was speaking about podcasting, I remember hiring him to do a jingle for me. This is the very first jingle for my podcast. So here we go. It's a proven technique in your car. Ever week in your car. Make a perfect plan. Let's get you a clip. Give me the tips to market in the fast lane. Take that trip. Okay. So that was the first jingle. It's pretty bad, but I had that jingle for like six years before ever actually did a podcast episode. Um, at the time, man, my business was on top of the world. We had like 60 employees. We had sales teams and marketing. I thought I was the greatest thing in the world and then everything crashed and collapsed. I remember we moved from a 20,000 square foot building to a 2000 square foot building. One from 60 employees down to like six. And it was one of those times where it was like emotional and painful and just it was a, it was, it was tough. The new office we got was about a five or six minute drive from my house. And when the first two times I was driving there, I had this impression like, Hey, you should start your podcast now. You know, you have marketing your car. You have the jingle. Um, you should, you should do this podcast. And I remember I was like, this is the worst possible time that I could do a podcast. Like I just lost my entire company. I'm in debt. Everything's horrible. But for some reason I felt this pulled like you should start to do this podcast. And so we figured it out. We set it up and we launched the very first episode of the marketing in your car podcast. Hey, everyone. This is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to the dot com secrets marketing in your car podcast. And it was literally me driving from my house to the office. And sometimes I would drive back and I was doing it three or four or five times a week, just kind of, it gets funny. Like Gary V talked about documenting your journey, but that's literally what I was doing was documenting the journey. And it's funny because if you go back and listen to those old episodes and I recommend go binge listening. In fact, if you go to marketing secrets.com and go to the content hub, there's a section that says marketing your car. You click on that. You can actually go subscribe to the old feed that has all the old marketing your car episodes. So much like the creation zone and me learning marketing again, right? And I was learning how to do things. And like, I remember there's an episode where I was like, you got to be a moron to want to make more than $10 million a year in a business. Like I've never tried that again. You know, it's funny things. Like I was, I was sworn to back then that, that now are funny. There were things I was discovering. We're discovering different way to write hooks. They're discovering different marketing funnels and campaigns. And like, man, it was like the most amazing for me, like the most amazing time of discovery of my life. And we did, I think four or 500 episodes of the marketing your car podcast. About that time is when I think dot com secrets book could come out, click funnels has come out, maybe even expert secrets. And about that time, John Reese, I bought pretty much everything that he's owned in the past, but I remember he messaged me and said, you wanted to sell traffic secrets, which is like, you know, I was like, Oh my gosh, I have dot com secrets book, expert secrets book, like traffic secrets book would be the third book in the trilogy. I'm so excited. And then he was like, you can buy all my domains if you want. So I bought traffic secrets and also about marketing secrets. And I remember I was like, marketing secrets is like, for me, as an umbrella brand of like all of the content stuff we're doing. I was like, it makes logical sense to rebrand the podcast and the marketing your car podcast, the marketing secrets podcast. What's up, everybody? I want to welcome you to today, the very first day of the official marketing secrets podcast. And then I've done, I don't even know if we even know like three, four, 500 episodes of the marketing secrets podcast. And it's been fun. It's been fulfilling. It was really kind of probably the next season of my life where it was like, Hey, we have this click funnels company, you know, two or three million dollars a year and we, you know, I podcasted the journey up to a hundred, $150 million a year beyond and it's been fun. But if I'm completely honest, um, over the last little bit's been come more mature and I think the reason why I was like, I don't know what to share on these podcasts. Like when I was discovering new things, it was all like, that was what was exciting. But then like we get more to the optimization, you know, of businesses and ideas and building teams and stuff like that. It wasn't ever like, it was harder for me to find like the thing I was excited about and I wanted to share that I wanted to give you guys. And in fact, I remember in Fiji, it was when I was doing my intervention with Tony Robbins, I remember JLD raised his hand and he was like, he's like, do I listen to every one of your podcast episodes? And I can hear you like just trying your best to squeeze in that time, like on your drives to work or wherever it can be. And it's always gold. And like, I always do kind of leave those episodes thinking like, what if Russell just had more time to create, to write, to do what frankly you do best? He's like, I wish he would slow down and just like share more cause like, I love them, but like, I always feel like you're just kind of hurrying to get them out. And if I'm honest, that's what it's been. It's been, you know, my brother messaging me like, Hey, we have podcasts episodes. I need to this week. And like, oh, like, what am I going to talk about it? And I was trying to bring really good stuff, but it hadn't been as thought through and planned out as possible. And I still want to go with it. So we kept doing them, kept doing them and hopefully you've gotten value from them. But about a week ago, I was just like, what's the future? It's like, what should we keep doing it? Should we not keep doing it? And if we do, do keep doing like, what would get me really pumped and really excited? And that's what brings us to where we are today. In fact, recently, as you probably heard me talk about, I've been acquiring old rare books from all of my favorite genres, like whole bunch of old Mormon books and personal development and business and like all those kinds of things. And probably conservatively in the last year, we could count the books in here, probably four or 5,000 books I bought. So yeah, I have a little of addiction called bibliomania. It's, you know, it's, it's a thing from that we, you know, we're building this big library, but we needed a place in the interim. So we kind of rented this office to store all the books. And one of the rooms we called the Napoleon Hill room had all the Napoleon Hill books and it was here to like, but it just didn't look that good. I filmed a couple of podcasts from here and it's like, now we should make this room look really cool. And so we painted it. We got some curtains. We got a bookshelf and then we put just the best books in here from Napoleon Hill, but also some of my other favorite authors and mentors. And this room became like, I don't know, it became special. Like you come in here and the energy is just different. I don't know. There's something really cool about it. And so for me, I started coming here. I started writing and I started spending more time and just a lot of my own right creative and energy was happening in here. And it's just, it was really special. And then we thought, man, like we should do something. And we kept trying to figure out how do we build YouTube videos and all these different things. And anyway, over the last week or so, I had an idea of like, I know what would get me excited about doing the podcast again. Number one, it'd be fun to do it in here in this room where it's just like, you have like, there's something special, something magic in here, you know, being in this room with, with some of the greatest minds of all time. Like obviously they've passed on, but their work is here and their legacy. A lot of these things are like first edition signed by the authors, which is just such a cool, I don't know, something cool about it. And that's something like, what would get me really, like, what would I be excited to share? And as I start thinking, there's a lot of things, you know, I, I did a podcast episode a little while ago talking about how we're buying different businesses, which has been, you know, it's fun and you guys are all geeked out. Like, oh, I got a lot of feedback from that episode, but I didn't tell you what businesses I bought or why I bought it. What the plan is, what's the strategy, what's working, what's not working, the ups and the downs, like all the journey of those. When the first business I bought was called Zoom and Juice, it's a green drink company. And I did it cause like, I, not that was bored, but I wanted to challenge. I wanted something fun. I want to be creative again. I wanted it to be in the business, right? Like the first decade of my life, I was in the business. I was launching tons of companies and stuff. And then when we launched ClickFunnels, I wrote the books, kind of retired from that. And I coached other people's businesses, but I wasn't in it anymore. I wasn't doing it. And I missed it. So I bought Zoom and Juice as a project to go and to, to get my hands dirty. I want to build a business and just make sure that I'm sharp. I know what's happening. So we bought that. I bought a bone broth company called Aubon Bone Broth. I partnered with a friend on a supplement line called Blackout and Phoenix, which is an energy thing. It's something to put to sleep. One of my original co-founders at ClickFunnels, Dylan Jones, creating a software company called OnePager. And we partnered on that. We just recently bought John Reese's company, Gearu.com. I also, I don't know if we publicly announced this yet, but here maybe is the public announcement. I just bought Lady Boss from Brandon and Katelyn Poland. I bought Magnetic Marketing from Dan Kennedy. I bought Dudely, Vumley, Tunely from Brad Callan. I bought Startup Drugs was a t-shirt company. I'm launching a company called Understand.me. I'm launching a new brand called Secrets to Success. I'm writing a book called Secrets to Success. I'm republishing a bunch of these books that are in the public domain. And like, there's all these things that I'm so excited to share and to talk about, but I've never had a place to talk about it. Like I would share a principle I've learned along the way, but how many is like an episode where I just go for 30 or 40 minutes telling you guys what, like why I bought Aubon and why I bought Vumley and the strategy and the things that I was working with, not working like what we're testing. Like, oh, crap, this didn't actually work. It's almost like going back to the original marketing secrets today, but instead of just sharing you as the journey of this one rebuild and business was click, you know, eventually became click funnels. I'm sharing all these other ones. That sounds like so much fun. And so that's part of the new updates is going to be. You'll notice when the new episodes come out, it'll be Zoom and Juice Part 1, Part 5, Part 12. And over time, you have a chance to like keep updating the things and Aubon, bone broth and Startup Drugs and different things. You can hear the journey behind these companies. I think it'll be, it'll be fun and fascinating and a lot of fun for me. You know, I think I can go more long form system in eight to 10 minutes on a podcast. I'll spend 30 minutes going through and maybe an hour. I don't know who knows how long these things will go. We'll find out today. I'm going to record a couple today. That got me really excited. Internally in the company called these virtual real estate. These are little real estate properties that we're creating. We're building a team. We're putting them out there and hopefully they'll make money for us. And some are some aren't. And I want to share these ideas with you and share the stuff I'm learning because I'm learning so many good things. There's, there's a magic in being in the business and getting your hands dirty again. It makes for me, makes me a better coach, makes me better trainer, makes me better teacher, makes us so we can build better software because I'm, I'm playing the game. I'm not just someone who, I mean, so many of the marketing gurus did a thing once and then they spent the last decade or two decades talking about like, I love this game, probably more so than anyone I've ever met. Like I want to be in the game again. So there's that. Also, I used to do decade a day calls, my inner circle members, why do consulting calls? And it was just for them to hear and for a long time is one on one. And then I start opening up where I let other inner circle members in to listen in on it. And I was like, man, what if I started doing these consulting calls, but like, let you guys listen to where they become podcast episodes. So I kind of want to launch a sub channel on the podcast, not sub channel, but just a sub show on the podcast called decade a day where I'm sharing these consoles. Funnacky Live has so many amazing presentations. I want to bring some of those back for you guys. I've never really done an interview show. There's people I want to interview. Like we just signed a deal with Damon John. We're doing a really cool project with him. Like I want to do an interview with him. We just, we're doing a project with a coal arbor. Like I want to do an interview with her, you know, like just other cool people that we're working with. I've never had a spot to do interviews to like get the marketing secrets in their brains. There's a lot of stuff I'm doing in the biohacking world. Last time I knew with personal development, like there's just more stuff I want to talk about. And so the thought was like, well, do I cancel the show? Do I do a new show? Do we do something different? And I think I still want to keep it under the, under the umbrella of marketing secrets because that's the lens. I want to share these ideas with you. I don't want to share like just like, here's a, here's a personal developments thing I learned. I want to do it through the lens of like, how can you use this in your business, either for yourself to become a better entrepreneur or how to use it as a tool to help the people that you're serving as well. And so that's kind of the, the, the game plan for the future of this podcast. It's going to be fun. I think we probably won't launch two or three episodes a week. Like we done the past might be one longer for an episode a week and then maybe some of the short forms. I still want to do some of these, you know, the similar marketing, your car, marketing secrets style where I get an idea and I'm in my car and I have an idea I want to, I want to share with you, but I want to do it when I'm actually inspired to share the idea, not just like, Hey, we need three episodes this week. Russell, what do you got? You know, um, one more Q and a calls. I think our team's going to reach out to a lot of you guys for answering questions. In fact, um, we're setting up a thing on, uh, marketing secrets.com. If you go to marketing secrets.com, you will scroll there and you can leave them a question and we'll pull those questions in and we can do Q and a shows where we have a chance to answer your specific question. Um, so there's a lot of fun ideas and things, but it, as we started talking about this, I got re inspired of like what this show could become and how I could serve and how I could lean into you guys and give you guys what you want as well as helping me stay sharp and like helping me to analyze what we're doing at a different level. Right. A lot of times these, these things are happening in my head, but when I can talk about loud, um, it helps me think through it a lot of times as well. And hopefully my team will listen to these more. So like the team working on zoom and juice, they should be listening to zoom and juice episodes to know where my mind's at so they can, they can run with it as well. A lot of times I'm a vision. I'm not always the best at articulating it to my team. So hopefully it's become a good tool for them as well. So anyway, that's kind of the vision, the plan of the future of the marketing secrets show. I hope you guys are on board. I hope you get excited. If you do, please let me know. Hit me up on Instagram, Facebook, wherever you're listening to these things. You can do it on your phone. You can take a screenshot of like the actual, if you're listening on your phone, like take a screenshot is and go to Facebook or Instagram or whatever and tag me in it. I see those all the time and just let me know. Like you just Russell's a good idea or, um, hopefully by the time this episode goes live, you'll be able to go to marketing secrets.com and like leave a question. If not, it'll be there in a week or two, but let me know your thoughts and your ideas and, and what you think about it. On top of that, like if you enjoy the show again, please go to iTunes or Spotify. We're at and like rate and review and leave the feedback. Uh, that way I can see those things as well. And it'll be, it'll be fun. I guess you can say that the, my podcast is growing up. Uh, but I don't want to lose any of the energy, the excitement from it, but I do want to, uh, how they build, I can spend more time and really think through things and give you guys stuff that's going to be super beneficial. I want to, I want to take this podcast from good to great. You know, uh, I've been talking to some of my friends, talking to my wife about this a lot recently, like just the concept of good is the enemy to great. Right. Like, why do people not have, um, great businesses? Cause they have good businesses. Why do people have great marriages? They have good, good marriages. Why people will not have great podcasts. They have a good podcast and I want to turn this podcast from good to great. I want to make everything in my life that I'm, that I'm touching. I want to transition from good to great because yeah, as long as we're here, might as well, might as well do the greatest we can, right? I had a conversation at the unlock the secrets kid event with all the kids and I talked about attitude and it's like, look, you have to go through this experience anyway, right? You have to go through school. We have to go through work. You have to go through the experience. The only thing you can really affect is your attitude. And so say the same thing, I'm in a podcast and might as well make it great. Like I'm doing it anyway. Um, might as well step back and make it great. So that's the goal. I'm going to try to make this great. On top of that, we're also using this as a platform where the podcast is going to be the top, the top level of all of my content strategies for you guys to understand this. Like I talked about this in the traffic secrets book about the chapter conversation domination where it's like, instead of doing what a lot of people do, or like they say, make a video and repurpose it on 50 different platforms. It's not that way. It's creating a show that then you can pull pieces out for different platforms. Right. And so that's kind of the game plan here as well as this marketing secrets show podcast. You recall it. I'll be recording it for the podcast and that's going to be the top like you guys in the podcast. I'm my number one goals to serve you guys. And then from that, we're going to take things and we'll pull pieces out to use for YouTube and use for Instagram and use for TikTok and things like that. So that's the game plan. So this is the death of the old marketing secrets podcast and rebirth of something amazing internally. I've been calling it season two, which is kind of funny because for season one had whatever 300, 500 episodes, whatever it was season two or starting over. Um, and, uh, this season, maybe the only a second season, uh, if we like enjoy it, but this is the game plan for the process moving forward. So thank you guys so much for listening. They can be part of the show excited for the future, excited to share some really cool things with you guys. I hope that it serves you. Hope it changes your business and hopefully it changes your life. Uh, thanks again for listening and, uh, we'll see you guys on season number two.
