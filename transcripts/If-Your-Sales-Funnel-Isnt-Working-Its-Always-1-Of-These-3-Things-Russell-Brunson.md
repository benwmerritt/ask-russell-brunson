## Transcript
Hook Story Offer. This is one of the coolest things I've ever discovered when it comes to marketing and sales and persuasion. And it's something like I literally was working out, I was going to the gym, thinking about a whole bunch of different things. And all of a sudden it just popped in my head. I was like, oh my gosh, this is the key to everything. I started looking at my own funnels. I looked at other people's funnels, looked at everyone I was consulting and what was crazy was I realized after I discovered this framework and started using it, I realized that no matter what is wrong inside of a business, on an ad, on a landing page, up sells down, whatever it is, if you're having a problem, it's always either the hook, the story or the offer. Now I got so excited by this, afterwards I went back and I was writing the Traffic Secrets book. And so I wrote a whole huge section about Hook Story Offer inside the Traffic Secrets book. But then I was also rewriting dot com secrets and expert secrets. And so in both those books, I also wrote different things about Hook Story Offer. And so it's the only framework that's in all three of my books right now. And then shortly after I updated all the books, we had a Funnel Hacking Live event. And at Funnel Hacking Live, this was the very first time ever I had a chance to share this principle I like to call Hook Story Offer. And so right now I'm actually preparing for Funnel Hacking Live. Normally I don't show you guys video clips of me at other events on the YouTube channel, but because I am working on like 12 different presentations right now, I thought how cool it would be to show you guys one of my favorite presentations from the past. The very first time I ever taught this concept called Hook Story Offer, now you can use it inside your business to grow your funnels, to make more sales, to hire conversions, and be able to serve more people inside of your community. So with that said, this video presentation from Funnel Hacking Live teaches you guys the principle of Hook Story Offer. How many of you guys are gonna have gone through the One Funnel Way Challenge? Yeah. Okay, those who have gone through it, if you know I stress a lot about one simple thing, which was Hook Story Offer. I talked a lot about that. And I wanna talk about that for the next hour or so because throughout this week, you're gonna be learning about a lot of different types of funnels, right? About challenge funnels and summit funnels and all these different things. And some of you guys may get confused, I wanna understand the core fundamental foundation of what you have to become good at as an entrepreneur is understanding this one concept, which is mastering Hook Story Offer. And so I'm gonna spend some time going on with that. Hook Story Offer. I gave everybody a handout that came with your, should be on your seats, you guys take notes on and stuff like that. But one of the things it says in there, I think on the very front page, is that something's not working in your funnel, it's always either your hook, your story, or your offer. Every time. And it's like, my funnel's not working, or else what should I do? I look at it and I'm like, oh, your hook is horrible. That's why nobody's clicking on your ad. Or, hey, your hook's good, people showed up, but your story's boring, that's why no one's buying. Or it's like, you hooked and you told a good story, but man, that offer was horrible. No one would ever give you money for that. And I've learned as I broke it down, consulting to three things, like it's always one of these three things. Okay, so I'm gonna spend the next hour or so going over this, giving you guys ideas and opening up your mind to becoming better at that. If you become better at that, this framework fits into any funnel. Okay, if I'm selling a book, I gotta be good at hook story offer. If I'm selling something through the phone, hook story offer, if I'm selling something through webinars, hooks, this is the framework that we all have to become masters at. So I wanna lead with that today, and then as everyone else starts training on different funnels and strategies, you just remember, if my funnel's not working, it's because of one of these three things every single time. Okay, if you were to hire me for my insanely high consulting race, like Russell, my funnel's not working, what should I do? I'd just be like, thanks for the check. It's either your hook or your story or your offer. So next time you're like, man, I wish Russell was like my funnel. Just sit down and be like, huh, what would Russell say? He would say, it's either your hook, your story, or your offer, okay? It's always one of those three things every single time. Okay, so with hook story offer, that's, it goes hook story offer, but I'm gonna start with the offer first and then move backwards just because that's kind of the framework how it works, okay? So the offer, excuse me, a lot of you guys have gone through like my training with perfect webinar so you see this thing called a stack slide. How many of you guys are familiar with a stack slide? Good, okay, the stack slide is like, hey, how we create an offer, okay? And even if you're not doing a webinar, you still create a stack slide. There is no circumstance when I ever sell that I don't use a stack slide. If I was emailing somebody and they were like, hey, what is the cost to hire you as a consultant or hire you to do whatever? I would literally send them an email and I'd have a stack slide. I just have like 4.1 value, two value, like I would use this in everything, okay? So, and I'm gonna show you guys some examples today. It doesn't matter if you're selling coaching or supplements or physical products or services like you should always have this, okay? Now to begin with, I wanna talk about one of the founding fathers of our industry. A lot of you guys may not even know him or heard of him. His name is Claude Hopkins. How many of you guys have heard of Mr. Claude Hopkins? All right, all my old Gs, all the originals. Okay, this is your marketing history lesson. So Claude Hopkins was the father of modern advertising. And what's interesting is way back then in the early 1900s, what they called, what he was called, what his job was, he was what they called a ski man. Okay, he was a ski man. What the ski men did is they came into a company and their whole job was to come up with the offer. That was it. The most important part, which is the offer, okay? Now to show you the value, even in like the late 1800s, early 1900s, the value of becoming a ski man, the person who actually creates the offer, Claude Hopkins back then was paid $52,000 a year, 1907. Okay, now the equivalent of that, that's $1.39 million a day's dollars. They paid this dude over a million bucks a year to come in and be like, this is where your offer is. Okay, and most of you guys never even think about this. You just kind of go off and like do whatever. And I'm not gonna, I'm excited, Stephen Larson's gonna be talking in two presentations. He's gonna go deep into like how much really cool offer stuff for you guys. But we understand like this is the value of like the most important part of offer. You have to understand that. This is so valuable that back then they paid people that much money to come create offers for them. Okay, so it's worth your time to start figuring these things out. Okay, now I wanna kind of talk about when offer isn't for a minute. Because most people in business, they think about like what's the product I'm gonna create. And the biggest problem when you create a product is that when you have a product, it is a commodity and anybody else can create it, right? And if you have a product and it's commodity, when you're trying to figure out how to sell it, the only thing you have to like as leverage is price. Okay, that's why when you go to Amazon, like someone's selling the thing at this price, it's like, oh, if I'm gonna beat him, I gotta sell it for less. I gotta sell it for less and less and less and less. And like it's a race to the bottom, which is the worst type of business to be in by the way. Dan Kennedy told me when I first got started and 14, 15 years ago in this business, he said that there is no strategic advantage of being the second lowest price leader in town. So if you can't be Walmart, like there's no sense of being the lowest price leader in town, but there's a huge strategic advantage of being the most expensive person in town, right? So if you're creating something like, you can create a product and become a commodity and you're racing to the bottom, or you understand how to create an offer which decommoditizes you, I'll show you here in a minute, and it makes it so you can charge whatever you want. Okay, so that's kind of the key you have to understand. So a product is like a one singular thing. And offers, we take a product and you bundle with a bunch of other things to increase the value and to make it unique and separate and different, right? If I were to sell this as a digital marketing event, there's like 800 digital marketing events you could have gone to, right? Why did you guys fly here in the middle of the rain? It's because it's different, right? It wasn't just a product, it's not a marketing event. It's a whole bunch of other stuff. When you bought ClickFunnels, most of you guys didn't buy it because it was like, oh, here's software, it builds websites. There's tons of software that builds websites, right? We created irresistible offers and bundled them together to make you go crazy to come and buy and to come here and do things, right? I spent a ton of time focusing on how to create an offer. Now one thing you have to understand, there are basically there's two ways to make your product cheapest in town. The best way to illustrate this. The first way is obvious, right? If you want to be the cheapest product in town, you have to decrease the price, which again, funnel hackers don't do that, okay? We don't, we should make a T-shirt that says that. Funnel hackers do not decrease prices, okay? If you decrease the price, you become cheaper than somebody else. The other thing is if you increase the value of what you're offering, then you become cheaper, right? Okay, because if I sell you something and it's worth a million dollars and I only sell it for a thousand, that's cheaper than the person who sells you something for a thousand bucks, it's worth a thousand bucks. Does that make sense? Okay, so I can either decrease the price or I can increase the value to increase the value of the thing. And if you look at this, it's interesting. I had this conversation with my kids the other day. Like how much money you make is 100% tied to how much value you give. It's 100% correlation. It's my kids were asking me, my kids are cute because they're the age where they're trying to start figuring things out. And one of my sons, Bowen, was like, dad, it doesn't make any sense. This guy over here is one of our friends. He's a doctor and he's way better than you, but you make way more money than him. How come? And I said, well, you get paid based on how much value you offer. He's like, but dad, he operates on people. That's way more valuable than what you do. And I smile, I said, it's definitely more difficult. Like that's, I can't imagine that. But I said, you don't understand. He's only able to operate on one human being at a time. So he's offering insane amounts of value for one person. So because of that, he gets paid really, really well, but it's, it's fine. It's as big as it can be. I was like, I'm able to offer value to 4,500 people or 76,000 people or a million people. So I create something of value and I create itself so many more times. And so I said, that's the reason I'm able to make more money than doctors because of how that works. And I kept explaining this to him. And so I told him, I was like, look, if you want to get a job, you get paid based on how much value you have, right? Okay, so like if you could job at McDonald's and they're paying, you know, whatever, what's minimum wage nowadays, eight bucks an hour, I'm like, that's how much value you're getting. I was like, but if you go and you can create something and you can do something bigger, the value is so much higher and you can get paid more money for that. Okay, and I was trying to explain this to a kid which is really, which is really fun. So the whole name of this game is you're creating funnels and you're figuring out, hook your store, your offer. You're trying to increase the value. Okay, so the offer increases the value of whatever it is you're trying to sell. Okay, so I'm gonna show you some practical life examples. The first one here is dating. Now, when I met my beautiful wife, Colette, the very first time, there were tons of men who wanted to date her and I was just a product. I'm like, hey, I'm like wearing baggy pants and like I have a shaved head and glasses and like, that was the product. That's the best I had, right? They were much better looking like dudes who dress nice, all sorts of stuff. And I was like, looking at me in like a lineup, it's like, man, there's much better offers out there, much better products, right? Because I was a commodity at that time. So it's like, okay, if I'm gonna convince my wife to marry me who's way more beautiful than me, what do I gotta do? It's like, I have to create an offer, I have to make this better, right? And this is true for any of the single men who are trying to figure out how things work. Like, you gotta bundle, right? So if I'm like, hey, do you wanna go on a date with me? She's like, I got asked by four of the people this week. I'm like, hey, this is the deal. I plan a date, it's gonna be amazing. What we're gonna do is we're gonna go to dinner and what's your fair place to eat? Oh yeah, we're gonna go there. And then what do you like to do? And when you plan an actual date and make an amazing offer, then she's like, she's not judging me versus somebody else, product versus product. She's like, oh man, that experience seems amazing, right? And the offer's better, okay? And so when you're dating, it's the same thing, right? When your business partner, when Todd came to me as a business partner, he had so much value. It wasn't just like, oh, I'm a programmer. I'm like, I'm a programmer who can turn your dreams into a vision, into reality, right? I can do this, I can do this, I can, and it also becomes this amazing offer. It's like, oh my gosh, I can't say no. The value gets so big, right? Okay, so it works in dating. It also works for movies. How many of you guys are pumped to see this movie next week? How many of you guys have no idea what movie this is? Okay, so if I came up to you and I was like, hey, Captain Marvel's coming out next week. Who wants to go with me? Yeah! This room is fine. If I walked into normal, I'm like, who wants to go with Captain Marvel with me? They'd be like, ah, but if I'm like, this is the deal. Okay, Captain Marvel's coming out. I'm so excited to come see this movie. So I'm so excited. What I did is actually, it comes out on my birthday. March 8th is my birthday. That's the day it comes live. But the night before, they're doing a private screening in Boise and I saw it in commercial for the other day. And on the commercial, it said, hey, the movie's coming out. Make sure to book your tickets now. And I was like, oh, so I went to the little app, the Fandango app, and I looked at the theater. There's only one theater playing it at 7.30 night before. And the half of the theater's taken. I was like, oh my gosh, half the theater's taken. So I bought the other half, okay? This is a true story. Clutch's like, why do you keep buying all these tickets? I'm like, I don't know. Someone's gonna wanna hang out with me. So if I was like, this is the deal. You can come to Boise with me, and we're all gonna go together. We got half the theater just for funnel hackers. It's gonna be amazing. You know, I went from a movie, like a $20 movie, to like this experience, right? And then ahead of time, we're gonna do, we're gonna go to my favorite sushi restaurant. There's a roll called the Rattlesnake Roll. And it's like this little podunk like strip joint in Boise that seems kind of weird, but they literally have the best sushi on planet Earth. I always bring people in there like, oh yes, Boise, sushi in Boise is gonna be great. And then they have it and they're like, oh my gosh. This is the greatest sushi I've ever had. I'm like, I know, how many of you guys have been there with me? A couple, yeah, it's insane. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna go sushi first. I'm gonna introduce you guys to the Rattlesnake Roll, best roll on planet Earth. Then we're gonna go, we have a separate funnel hacker section. We're gonna watch Captain Marvel together. Third thing is I'm gonna buy costumes for each of us. And all of us gonna pick somebody. It's gonna be amazing. And it's gonna be awesome. And then fourth off, after it's done, we'll come back to my house and then we'll like, we'll just goof off, we'll play in the wrestling, we'll play on the tramps and stuff. It'll be amazing. How many of us wanna come to that movie now? Yeah. So you see how I increase the value? Like going from like, oh, I'm gonna go to the movie to like, oh my gosh, I'm gonna book a plane and we're gonna fly there tonight, right? Just by increasing the offer. Okay, so if someone's not buying your thing, it's cause your offer's not good. How do you increase the offer? How do you make it better? Okay, always saying how to make it better, how to make it better? Okay, we have a product we sell right now. It's two pieces of paper that we sell for a thousand bucks. How many of you guys are giving me a thousand bucks for two pieces of paper? My die hards, thank you. All right, well, we literally do. So I have two pieces of sales scripts, our high ticket sales scripts, two pieces of paper we sell for a thousand bucks. And if you look at it, you're like, I would never pay a thousand bucks for two pieces of paper, Russell. And most people wouldn't, but I'm like, these two pieces of paper, guess what they are? This is our high ticket sales script, okay? Today we've done just short of $30 million in sales with these two pieces of paper. You, someone pick up the phone, you read this one, and then you read the other side, and then they give you money. It's amazing, it just works every single time. And I didn't make it up. People have been using it for years. There's been billions of dollars in sales track back to these two pages. And the person I know in the world who's the best, this is a guy named Robbie. In fact, Robbie's here in the room, where's Robbie at? He's here somewhere, he's probably out doing it. So Robbie is the one who showed me the script initially, and he trained me, and they trained ourselves guys and brought the whole team, and he did that everywhere, we're not, okay? So for a thousand bucks, I'll give you two pages, but then I'll also give you Robbie in a box. So how do you guys like Robbie to make videos to train your entire sales team just for you? It's amazing, right? So you hire sales people, you give them these two pages, and they say, watch the videos of Robbie teaching you. They watch those for like three hours, and they come out ruthless sales, people can sell anybody, anything, right? And then you're like, but that's cool, but I don't have any ads. I'm like, okay, how about this? I will give you the ads that we run, and I'll give you the funnels I run, I'll just give those to you as well, right? And then how about I can hook up a call, where you can jump on the call with Robbie for 30 minutes, he'll train your sales people one on one to make sure it's customized the script specifically for you. Now how many of you guys pay a thousand bucks for that offer? Okay, you see how it works? Like it went from two pieces of paper, I bundle it all the time, it's like, oh my gosh, I have to have that, okay? If people aren't buying, again, it's the always hook story offer. If it's your offers, because you don't have, you gotta figure out how to make it better, how to increase it, okay? One final way challenge, the same thing. This is a challenge where you get to jump on a coaching call every day for 30 days. See the energy like, oh. Now let me tell you all the stuff you get. The first thing you get is you get the big old box in the mail, inside the box is a book called 30days.com, where 30 people of our two comic book winners each wrote a chapter about how they got in the two comic book. And then there's videos I'm showing behind the scenes of each of their funnels. And then on top of that, you're gonna get 30 days of video from me. Then you get 30 days of video from Julie Stoing, and then on top of that, Steven Larson will come on every single day and yell at you and make sure you actually get the stuff done. By the time they're done, your funnel's gonna be finished. We go on and on and on, all of a sudden, like this is like the most irresistible offer of all time. Okay, the first challenge with 7,500 people signed up for it. My goal is to get 10,000 people a month signing up for this challenge, and we keep making the offer better and better and better. If you wanna sell more stuff, figure out your offer and make it sexier, increase it, make it better. So the question is like, well, how do you do that? Some of you guys are like, I sell this thing, how do I make it sexier? How do I make an offer? So the fastest way to increase an offer is to bulk up by adding other types of information products. So I'm gonna go through a couple ways to you guys create quick information products to bulk up any offer without actually having to write a book. Does that sound like fun? All right, cool. So I'm gonna go through three different things you can do, number one, there are written words, I'm gonna show you how to do it without actually writing any words. Number two is audio, and number three is video. This will give you guys ideas so nobody will ever say, well, I can't create an offer, Russell. With these things I'm gonna show you, you can create millions and millions of offers. In fact, if you start looking at everything I do, you'll notice there's always one of these three things I'm using to bulk up my offers every single time. Okay, so the first are written themes. So the first thing I wanna show you guys is, how many of you guys would love to have a book but you don't wanna write a book? Books are the most painful part of everything I've ever done ever, by far. So this is a book, there was a crowd source book called Chicken Soup for the Soul. How many of you guys have read Chicken Soup for the Soul? Okay, how many of you guys have read one of the eight million versions since then? Okay, the most amazing thing about this book is that the authors who wrote this book didn't actually write any of the words in the books. Isn't that great? Yet they still made millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars. The other day my son came into my little office, it was Boan again, he came in and he saw this book and he said, dad, is that your new book? And I said, yeah, he's like, you wrote another new book? I was like, well, kind of. He's like, what do you mean kind of like? Why wrote the title? And that was it. He's like, did you cheat? I'm like, no, I didn't cheat. I said, I have 30 people who got two Comic Club awards, right, how they would get a two Comic Club award, they could do it again. And he's like, and then they just wrote the chapter. I said, yeah, and I put it in a book and then we sell the book. He's like, but you didn't write anything. I wrote the title, it's a really good title. And he's like, I don't think that's a real book, dad. I'm like, no, it really is, okay? How many of you guys decide whatever business you're in could find a whole bunch of experts and whatever it is and you could write a book like this? This book alone, we did the very first launch of the One Fun Away Challenge where we gave this away and we closed it down for like four months. People were auctioning these things off. Someone sold one for over $500 on eBay. People were going crazy for this book, right? Now when we launched One Fun Away Challenge, we were like, you guys get this book and people flip out. People buy it just because they want the book. I didn't write a word of it, okay? So I don't think about this like how could you guys, like Chicken Soup for the Souls, Trailblaze it for us. I've trailblazed it for you. How could you guys do that same thing in your market? Find people around you and say, hey, let me interview you. Let me interview you 30 of you or 20 of you or 10 of you and put it together and make a book. Make a, like there's a million things you can do with that. But it's a fast, easy way to create a book. You actually have to do it. Okay, number two way to get written books really fast is to compile examples of stuff. How many of you guys read my 108 split test book? Okay, this is literally just screenshots of 108 of our split tests and people go crazy for it. Okay, how many of you guys are doing stuff in your business or whatever it is you do that you have like this by-product? We weren't planning on selling this. We were just doing split tests and it takes screenshots of the split tests and eventually like two years later, like we should just put these all in the book. We just compiled a whole bunch of examples and we sold it. Okay, this right here, how many of you guys remember the Funnel University? Every month we find a couple of funnels and we compile them and talk about them and we show them to people. They're not my funnels, they're other people's funnels. We just find the cool ones and we show them and we put them in a newsletter. Okay, how many of you guys have seen this book? The 74 Funnel Swifile. None of you guys have seen it yet. Another product coming out soon to a funnel near you, right? Same thing, we're just compiling cool stuff. How many of you guys have seen cool stuff before? All right, you should just compile it then and then break a book and then it's amazing. More people will probably rate this book than my other books that I spent years slaving on to write and they're like, oh, this is way better, okay? One of my favorite ones, this is kind of a tricky one. Have you guys ever heard of the public domain before? This is where Walt Disney got all of his ideas, by the way. He never wrote anything. He just went to the public domain, he's like, oh sweet, someone wrote a story about a beauty and the beast or about the snow princess or about all these things. Found these public domain stories and produced movies out it. Okay, anything that was written pre-1923 in the United States is in the public domain you can republish it as your own. Okay, one of my friends, Matt Fury, he took this old 1914 wrestling course, Farmer Burns, published in a book, made over a million dollars selling that course. Okay, have you guys read Thinking Girl Rich? Master Key Systems, tons of the books that you guys are know and you are aware of are all in the public domain, you can republish them. So there's two places I go for public domain stuff. Number one, I go to Gutenberg.org. Everything on Gutenberg.org is in the public domain. They just published, there's like 50,000 e-books there. You can find it when you're market, you can take it and republish it as your own. The second secret, I go to eBay and in eBay in the non-fiction book section, you can search by years. So I search by year and I start typing keywords in my market and you'll be amazed at how many amazing books have been written that people are selling on eBay for $1.50. You can then republish and sell for whatever you want. Bundle inside of your offer to quickly get amazing books. Okay, so those three fast ways to make books. Crowd source them, compile a bunch of examples or go in the public domain. Okay, now here's the concept I know you guys understand is we'll move from the first three to the next three and beyond. This will make this whole process simpler for you. Okay, the concept is this. People will spend more money for the exact same content packaged in a different way. Okay, say it again. People will spend more money for the exact same content packaged in a different way. Okay, when I first started this business, I remember going to events like this and the speakers, every single time some speaker would say, who here's your thinking girl rich? By the way, how many of you guys have your thinking girl rich? Which is in the public domain by the way, so yes, and I'll republish this, make thinking girl rich for Dennis, thinking girl rich for surfers, thinking girl rich for whatever. Anyway, it's there, ready for you. But anyway, so I kept hearing that, so I went and bought the book and I was like, I'm so excited to read this book and I put it next to my bedstand and it sat there for months and months and then years and every time I go to events people are like, who's your thinking girl rich? I raise my hand and I'm like, oh, I actually read it, I have it. Someday I'll read it. And one day I remember feeling guilty, I went on eBay and I typed thinking girl rich CDs and someone was selling the CD course of it. And so I bought the CDs, got it in my car and for the next like three weeks I started reading thinking girl rich in my car. Now what's interesting about this is the book thinking girl rich cost me $9.97 on Amazon. The CDs cost me $97 on eBay. So I literally paid 10 times more money for the exact same thing packaged in a different way. Like was there any difference in the book and the audio? Literally word for word, some dude read the book and then it became CDs and I spent 10 times as much. Okay, this is a lesson for you guys. How many guys read the dot com secrets book? Let me just read the expert secrets book. Why are you here then? Everything I know is in those books. Like it's, I got nothing else. Oh, because it's packaged a different way. Does that make sense? We all understand that like what you have, you can package in so many different ways and because of the experience, how it's being fulfilled, all the things, it shifts the value of it, right? This is way more valuable than a $10 book. This experience in being here. He's got a foot. All right, so I'm gonna shift over to audio now, okay? So this is a book that we republished. This is in the public domain called Life, Work, and Farmer Burns. I had my father log it a microphone out, he read it. We turned it into a CD and we started selling, this is probably 10 years ago, started selling this book on CDs. So you can find a book and you can read it. You can have somebody else read it. You find the book in public domain. You can find somebody that and you can make an audio book. Very simple, easy way to do it, okay? Number two is you can interview others. So this is a book, how many of you guys have read this book by the way? I know all of our two Comic-Con X members, I sent you guys a copy of it. Everyone's like, this thing is bigger than the phone book. It's one of the best books ever. And I remember when it first came out, David Fry, where's David at? Yes, so David got it and he's like, this book's amazing that he called it Vince James, the author and he interviewed him for a whole bunch of stuff and he made a whole audio course out of it. And Dave's a genius and I was like, I should just do what Dave did. So then I called him up, I was like, hey, can I interview you too? And he was like, sure. And so I interviewed the guy who wrote this book. The guy made, he was a 20 year old kid, made $100 million through direct mail selling supplements. And so I called him on the phone and I interviewed him and he let me interview him for six hours. When it was done, he's like, you can have the rights to the audios. I have the rights to them, you can do everything with them. I'm like, sweet. And so then like two years later, I launched it and this actually became my very first ever two comic club funnel. I made a million dollars selling the interviews of the interview I did with this guy who wrote the book. Isn't that amazing? So how many of you guys have ever read a book before? How many of you guys could call the author and be like, hey, can I interview you? And some of you guys say, oh, he's too famous. He wrote all these big books. He's never gonna interview me. Can I tell you the life of an author? If you guys really wanna know how it works. They geek out on a topic. They spend their whole life writing this book and they're so proud of it and they're so excited, right? And then they tell their spouse or their family, their friends, they're like, okay, that's weird. And they're like, oh, nobody cares? And then there's an audience who gets a book and they love it and they read and they're like, oh, my people, they read it, right? And then somebody calls and they're like, hey, that book was amazing. Can I interview? The person's like, yes, you can. Just so you know, they want you to talk to them. They want to share the stuff. Doesn't happen enough. You went to Amazon and find the top 10 authors of books in your market, I guarantee you, nine out of 10, you can get on the phone for free that fast. Or you could actually, I don't know if Jason Fladlone was here this year, but Jason gave me an idea that was brilliant. He was doing an offer. This kind of ties back to the story we'll talk about here in a minute, but. He was doing an offer where he was selling a funnel course and he was like, I want to interview someone who did e-commerce funnels. So he was like, well, Trey Llewell has got the highest grossing e-commerce funnel right now inside of ClickFunnels. I want to interview Trey. So he calls up Trey and he's like, hey, can I interview? And they're friends. And Trey's like, sure, man, you can interview me. And Jason's like, well, I need to wire you some money first. And Trey's like, no, don't worry about it. I'll do the interviews. Like, no, no, no, I need to wire you the money because otherwise there's no value in this interview. He's like, what? And Trey's like, whatever. So Jason wires him like $5,000. He does the interview. And then when you see, when Jason's selling his product and does the stack, he goes through a stack. He's like, number one, number two, and three. He's like, number three right here. You see this right here? This is the guy. He is the number one e-commerce seller in ClickFunnels. He had a funnel to $20 million in six weeks selling flashlights. And I wired him $5,000 to interview him. I wanna find out the, I mean, he does interviews, but I wanted to find out the real stuff. So I paid him $5,000 to interview him. And that interview you guys could have. All of a sudden that bullet point in this stack slide went from, oh, it's an interview. That's worth $5,000 now. The value instantly shoots up, right? So, interview people is huge. In fact, when I launched the 10X Secrets course, I had my offer and it was good. And I was like, how do I make this sexier? So the first thing I did is, I interviewed a bunch of people. I interviewed this man right here. Where's Myron at? Everyone loves Myron. Yeah. Anyway, I interviewed Myron. I interviewed a bunch of people who I learned how to close from stage from. I interviewed all of them, plugged that into the course, increased the value of the course. Okay, so interviewing people is huge for any product. I don't think it was a product I put out that I would interview people. I do it, even if it's my product, I'm like, who were the 10 other people I could interview who have done something similar? Because all those things increase the value of what it is I'm selling. Okay? And then the last audio one is compiling hard to find podcasts and audios and things like that. Okay? If I told you guys, I'm like, hey, my favorite podcast is Mixer G. I should go listen to it. How much value is in that? Not much, right? But if I was like, okay, there's this one interview that Andrew did. And in the interview, he started talking to the guy and he literally, the guy showed three different websites that were the key to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I listened to those things. I found the websites. I never knew they existed. I started doing the thing and that's how we got ClickFunnels to do whatever, right? If I tell you that, you're like, oh my gosh, I wanna hear that podcast. Like, cool. When you sign up for my thing right now, I'm gonna give you a link directly to that podcast so that you can find it. Okay? You curating stuff for people, there's value in that. Okay? YouTube videos. I've done tons of times with Optin's who were like, Optin here to get a free video from Robert Kiyosaki teaching, the number one tax strategy for middle-aged Americans. And I just found a video on YouTube of Robert Kiyosaki teaching, the number one thing on whatever. And that's what I get people when they opt in. Okay? So you curating stuff you think is cool can be bundled into offers as well. Okay? So there's the audio ones really quick. So audiobooks, interviewing other people and compiling hard to find audios is a big thing. Last time I'm gonna go through really quickly is video. Okay? There is a program. How many guys here use Windows? How many guys use Macs? All right. Holy cow. All right. Okay? There's a program. If you are using, if you are using, if you're Windows, you should be using Camtasia, if you're using Mac, you should be using ScreenFlow. This tool has made me and probably most people more money than ATLs on Earth. It just records whatever's happening on your screen. So you make a presentation or slides or literally, the very first version of the Funnel Hacks training, the one that got us from zero to 10,000 customers, I had a Word document open on the screen with my notes. And the right hand side, I had a little picture. I just clicked record on ScreenFlow and I talked for an hour as I read through my outline. We did like 10 million plus dollars in sales and that was what the product looked like. For real, so I'm a professional video studio. You don't need one. Just get a microphone, ScreenFlow or Camtasia, record your screen, have a presentation and just teach it. Okay? It's super easy. It's simple. It's like the easiest thing in the world to do. Okay? Number two video thing is just get your iPhone out. Um, literally you can get your phone out and just make videos. Where's Rachel at? She in the room right now? We were on a, did you finish the course by the way? Can I talk about that? So Rachel, we were on this like little cruise thing after the 10X event and she came to me. She's like, I have an idea. It's gonna be a course called Selfie Secrets. Am I gonna ruin this? And I'm gonna record the whole thing on my iPhone and then she like the next day recorded an entire course on her phone teaching the entire course, which is amazing. And it was all on her phone. Okay? So how many of you guys have a phone? You have everything you need. All right. Okay. And you just all buy her course when it goes live. All right. And the last thing is like, you should throw a workshop teaching people stuff and you only have to speak and bring other speakers to teach for you. Okay? When I first got started, I didn't have any product to sell. And so the first thing I did is I threw a workshop and it was really exciting to have a workshop. I was pumped about it, but I had nobody coming. And so I emailed my tiny list of time and said, I'm doing a workshop, it's $5,000 a ticket. And then the first day nobody bought and second day nobody bought and third day one guy bought. And first I was like, yeah. And I was like, oh crap. Now I have to do a workshop. There's only one person coming. This is awkward. And then luckily two other people I saw three people buy. I was like, okay, now we have a workshop with three people. And so I called everybody I knew, my friends, my family, everybody. I was like, okay, I'm doing a workshop. People paid to be here. You have to come and just sit in the audience and don't tell them you didn't pay because I need to look good on video or it's gonna be super embarrassing. And so we set it up, we had it all set. And it was like not like this. It was really bad. We literally had the windows behind me were too bright. So we got sheets from the bedrooms and electrical tape sheets. It's so bad. But we recorded and that became the very first course I ever sold was the videos from us at the Holiday Inn with the electrical tape over the sheets, literally behind me the entire video. And it looked amazing. Okay, so throw a workshop, even if nobody comes to or just invite your friends, do something at your house, bring people in, just record them teaching your thing and you can butt a lot in really quickly. So for videos, we've got screen captures, high iPhones and workshops. So here's a real quick recap of the nine ideas. Crowd sourcing books, compiling examples, public domain, audio books, interviewing, compile hard to find audio, screen captures, iPhones and workshops. Tons of easy ways to do that quickly. Okay, so what we're doing now is I wanna actually, I'm trying to think if we should do this or not. I'm gonna let you guys do this on your own. But in your paper that I handed out, I have this little section here for you guys to figure out what are potential products I could bundle inside of my offer, okay? And this is something we do all the time. Every time we have a new product comes out, we talk to slash, we have bat meetings where like, we literally send out a bat signal to Vox or if everyone on our marketing team, we all come on zoom and wherever that from around the world we get in front of Wipe-O-Rite. Okay, what can we create for this product? We can put this in it and this in it, we start just dumping out as many different ideas as we can. Okay, so now you guys have like, let's say I'm selling this product, what else can we do? Oh, we can interview this guy, I can compile these things here, I can do this, I can make a video, I can do a workshop, we can do it. And all these things you can quickly create to turn this into an offer, okay? Now really quick, I guarantee you, I know the number one thing going through some of your heads right now is like, well, that's cool for all the coaches and the consultants and the info product people, but not for me, I'm different. I sell real stuff, right? I sell physical products, I have a local business or whatever your excuse is right now. And I wanna shadow these excuses because the biggest thing that's gonna keep you guys from having success over this week is the thought of like, oh, well this doesn't apply to me. Okay, I'm excited, I think either tomorrow or the next day we're gonna have Jamie Cross who's gonna come up here and speaking, yeah. Jamie's amazing because two years ago she came to Funnel Hacking Live, she was sitting in the audience and she sells soap, okay? And I was on stage talking about webinars. I'm doing this usually about webinars and stories and this whole thing, right? And every other e-commerce person I'm guessing in the audience is like, this is not for me because I sell physical products. And Jamie said, how can I make this work for me? 12 months later she was on stage and she was giving two common couple of words. 12 months later she was on stage sharing her store with you. She took this concept of the webinar and made an e-commerce webinar. She didn't say this isn't gonna work for me, how can I make this work for me? And shifted some things and made it work for her and blew up her company. I'm so excited for her tell a horror story. But I want you guys to think the same thing, okay? So I'm gonna do some example right now. This is a product that I sell. This is a physical product called Viagon. How many of you have ever seen this before? The three people on my team. All right, so back in the day when I launched 15 companies in a year, which is a horrible idea, don't do that. One of them was this thing right here. I had a friend who had this company and he was getting in trouble and this little machine here, if you start getting a cold sore, how many of you guys get cold sores? You feel it tingle, you pull this out. If I can open it. This is a new one so the seal hasn't been cut yet. All right. Then you peel the seal off. All right, so when you open this thing up, when you feel a cold sore coming on, come on, there we go. All right, you open it up and there's these two little electrodes, okay? And you take it and you push the button and then the same cold sore you put on your cold sore and somehow, I don't know how, some scientist figured out something. It's actually patent everything. It goes in and like zaps the cold sore, destroys it, kicks it in the face and destroys it and the cold sore never shows up, okay? Isn't that awesome? How many of us want one of these right now? Really? Gotta get my funnel back up. Anyway, so this is the physical product I sell, right? And you're like, well, Russell, this is, I don't sell information, this isn't gonna work for me. But imagine if I did this, how do I turn this into an offer? This is a physical product, it does what it does, it's just a thing, okay? And the guy who I buy these from, he sells it to other people, so it's not like, I'm not the only one, it's a commodity. There's like 30 other people that sell the same thing. Oh, mine's better. Okay? So for me, how do I compete against everybody else? Well, everyone's got the exact same thing, it does the exact same thing. So I have to turn this from a commodity into an offer. Because if it's a commodity, I gotta be like, okay, well, he's selling for 150, I'm gonna sell for 130 and then the next is also 120, crap, 110, 19, 15, boom, boom, boom, students, this thing's like $19.95, right? Retail, okay? That's the problem with products or commodities. Or I can say, okay, this is amazing, this helps with cold source, but what else could do with cold source? Okay, what else can I do? What else can I do? I could go on Amazon and be like, cold source, cold source here's and remedies. And I guarantee there's people on Amazon who have written books on how to do cold source. I can message one of them, like, hey man, you are the definitive expert in cold source. Can I interview you, talking about all the tricks you know how to prevent cold source from happening? I'm sure there's stuff in your diet and exercise, right? And like, oh yes, so I get them on phone, I interview them. Now it's like, hey, when you buy from anybody, you get the same thing, but you buy from me, you get the cold source inhibitor, plus you also get the interview with this dude over here who's the number one highest stars on Amazon writer of a cold source book, you get his book as well, plus my interview where I actually interviewed him. And then number three, there are seven supplements I found that help get rid of cold source, seven. There's a whole bunch of people who claim the supplements, there's actually seven that work, and there's two that work almost instantly. The second you feel cold, you pop, and you need these two pills, gone instantly, okay? And I wrote a report about those, because I wanna make sure you get the right ones, if you get the wrong brand, you get the right product, you get the wrong brand, you are screwed. So I'm gonna show you the seven supplements as well. So you get this first, plus you're gonna get the interview with the number one expert in the world, plus you're gonna get the seven supplements, the actual brand names, where to buy them, how to get the discounts, all the seven supplements. And next thing you're gonna get is blah, blah, blah, blah, all right? I just take a physical product, and I'm bundling information around it to increase the value of the thing, okay? So it doesn't matter if you're selling information or not, if you're selling physical products, the same thing, information is the easiest way to bundle this, right? The problem with infomercials is the only way they bundle, is like, if you call now, I'll give you another one for free. Right, that's what almost all e-commerce people do, it's like, oh, that's good, but like, that's, it's like, now I got two of these things, so if I have cold swords, I can have one in my house and it in my office, that's kinda weird, right? But if I bundle with information, it probably doesn't increase the cost to you at all, but dramatically increases the value, okay? Now when I'm competing with the 30 other people selling this, I can sell it for higher, and people will still buy it from you versus everybody else because my offer's better than theirs. Okay, another good example of this is my friend, Mr. Steven Larsen. How do you guys know Steven? So this is a good example for any of you guys who are like, I'm here Russell, but I don't have a product yet. So Steven, he has his own product, but he's also an affiliate for ClickFunnels, he's an affiliate for a bunch of other things, right? And so we did the one Funnel Away launch and the 10X launch, a couple other things, he said, okay, Russell already created an amazing offer that he's selling, but there's like a thousand other affiliates who are all selling this product as well, right? He said, so everyone's doing it, so how do I compete against this? He said, okay, well here's Russell's offer, how can I make my own offer to make it better? People ask me, how do you make money as an affiliate, Russell? The first thing you do is you don't sell the product that they're already selling, that's like a buy Russell's thing, that's like number one on your list, and it's like now I need to make my own offer, okay? How many of you guys bought the one Funnel Away challenge from somebody and then bought it again from Steven later because you wanted his bonus, okay? How many of you guys bought twice from Steven because you wanted the new bonus the second time? Okay, there's a lesson in this. So even if you don't have a product yet, it's okay, find some else with a product and then how can I now make an amazing offer? What can I bundle together to increase the value of this offer so people buy for me versus somebody else? Or if they did buy for someone else, they'll also buy for me because my offer is so valuable, okay? All right, so this is kind of the exercise for you guys to start doing is going through here and listing out all the ideas you can have, okay? So tonight, this weekend, with that paper handy out, start writing out these things, start putting them out there and start putting as many as you can think of and make it, like the biggest problem you can have is you're kind of putting in your potential products that are gonna make an offer, it's like, oh, that's not gonna work, that's not gonna work. When you start to be creative, like when we first did this, man, probably 12 years ago, we sat in front of a whiteboard and we were doing this and we were like, we were at a point where we needed a funnel to save us from everything, right? It was like the bottom of everything, like we had to make the most irresistible offer ever or else we were shutting the doors. So we sat in front of a whiteboard and we were like, okay, what could we give them, like, okay, they can fly to my house and I will give them a massage and feed them food and then we're gonna do this and we're gonna do this and we're gonna, like, we made all this crazy stuff, we had all on the whiteboard and then when we started to say, okay, what's the offer actually gonna be, we're like, well, pretty sure my wife would be mad if I hadn't put it in my house and I give them a massage just let's not do that one. But it was there, right? And it's like, what if we did this? What if we, and then it gave us some time to brainstorm and then from there, we start pulling things over to actually make an amazing offer, okay? Anytime I create a new funnel, a new thing, I'm always looking at creating an offer, please make potential things as possible and then I can know what am I actually gonna create, pull them into my little stack slides, like now I know I need to create to increase the software, okay? All right, now one thing I wanna mention as well, the reason I have a whole bunch of things as well is because there's more than just one offer in every funnel. You guys understand that? And so I need a lot of stuff that I can give away, right? If you look at this right here, there's an offer on my ad. I'm trying to get someone to click on something. So I'm like, click on this thing and I'm gonna give you a free report, right? There's an offer happening there. Luckily that was one of my ideas I already created because I can now pull that down and it becomes this, right? Then they land on my landing page. I'm like, I need their email address, I'm trading them. What am I gonna have? Oh, well, I have something up here. I've already created potential products. I'm gonna give them my interview with so-and-so. Give me your email address, I'll give you the interview with so-and-so. Boom, right? There's the next product. Now by this product, I'm gonna give you these five things. Then my upsell is these three or four things, okay? I think so many of us go into this thinking like, okay, here's the product I'm gonna sell and then we're trying to build a funnel around it and it's like, no, no, no. Understand this, like, you're looking at more like, how do you serve your customer? And like, what are all the things you could possibly give them to do that? And then you're breaking down to the different parts of the funnel, okay? All right, so come back to the hook story offer. So that was the offer section of this part, okay? It's the offer. Now we're gonna move backwards to the story, okay? So the question then is like, why are stories so essential to this? Okay, stories also increase the value. Okay? Now, couple of things I wanna understand. Number one, for someone to change their destiny, they have to make a decision. Okay, this is true first off for all of you and second off, it's true for all the people you're serving. Okay, for someone to change their destiny, they have to make a decision. Number two, for them to make a decision, you have to change their state. Okay, and then the best way to change their state is through story. So if we take that backwards, I gotta figure out how to tell stories so I can change people's states. If I can change their state, then I can help make a decision that's gonna empower them. And if I can help them make a decision that's gonna empower them, I can change their life. I can change their destiny. That's why stories are so important, okay? An offer without a state change is completely useless. If I was like, hey, who wants to go to the movie Captain Marvel this week? Oh, like three of you, like, yeah, remember? Then I tell the story and you're like, oh my gosh, I will mortgage my house to fly there for that experience, right? The story is what makes it valuable, okay? So the big secret is storytelling. We've talked a lot about this in our community. This is not unique. But I wanna kinda go through this because the story's being weaved into every single thing we're doing, okay? You have to come better and better at better story, okay? For all of you guys who read Expert Secrets, you know the next part of this, I wanna share it for those who may not or are new, okay? This is a concept we call the Epiphany Bridge story. So the Epiphany Bridge is the thing what you're thinking about as you're trying to figure out how to tell your stories, okay? So the Epiphany Bridge, this is you, back before you were whoever you are now, right? This is back when you were in your normal life before you like figured out whatever it is you're so passionate about today, right? So for me, before I learned about this whole funnel thing, I was just at my house hanging out doing nothing, like that was me. And then something happened, right? We're all sitting here, you have this aha moment, you're like, oh my gosh, this is the thing. This is the thing I was meant to do. This is like what I was supposed to be doing, right? And then what happens is you get so excited by that thing, you have that moment, okay? So for me, it's happened tons of times in my life, right? I think about when I was wrestling, like, you guys are my parents who were here in the front row. I used to come home from school every day. I would eat rice, crisps, and cheers and watch TV, right? And then in eighth grade, my dad made me sign for wrestling. I was like, I don't wanna be a wrestler. I just do like too much work. I just wanna watch TV. And he made me go, made me go, I had a good time wrestling. I was like, okay, in the next year, I remember my very first, it was ninth grade, I had a chance to, I made it to the JV team. And I remember I went to Wayne's, I was so scared, so nervous, I go to Wayne, and the guy that I'm wrestling has a mustache. I still to this day cannot grow a mustache. I don't know why. Anyway, I can't. And I remember looking at this kid, I'm like, he's got a mustache. He is gonna destroy me. And I got so scared, I went to the match, and we're getting in the stadium, and it's the JV match. So the only two people in the audience, were my mom and my dad. I'm like, God, I get out there, I shake his hand, I'm like, how does it grow facial hair in eighth grade? Like, oh my gosh. And so we start wrestling, and somehow, I don't know what happens, but at the end of the match, I win, and I stand up and my hand gets raised. And I look over the guy with the mustache, and his head's down. I look at my mom and my dad, and my dad's like freaking out. And I was like, this day is the day I became a wrestler. That was my ha moment, right? And then only thing I thought about for the next decade and a half of my life was wrestling, right? Same thing happened in business. I remember like, I was trying things, trying things, and all of a sudden, like I remember when it hit me, I was like, this is my thing, like this is what I'm gonna do for the next decade of my life, okay? My guess is most of you guys have had that moment. That's why you're probably here, trying to figure out the rest of the story, right? So that happens, then we go on this amazing journey. We're like, this is amazing, and we start studying everything, we start learning, we start geeking out, and the worst thing in the world happens to us. We start understanding why this thing's amazing, right? And then we have a chance to try to sell somebody on this thing that we love, that we care so much about. We're so excited, and the first thing we do is we get a technical babble, all this technical stuff we've learned, and we spew it out upon them. And they're like, oh, they get buried in this thing, and they freak out, and they run away. We logically try to sell them because we're so logically invested in this thing right now. But the reality is that people don't buy logically, you didn't buy logically. My dad didn't convince me, you're gonna love wrestling because it's gonna be good health for you, you're gonna get stronger muscles, you're gonna like, it's gonna help you become more resilient in life, you're gonna, you know, all these things, like, that was the logic, okay? What sold me on wrestling? Oh my gosh, that felt amazing. I'm in. Something happened to each of you emotionally that got you in, okay? And so for us to be able to convince other people, we have to get rid of all the technical babble, and you have to remember, what was the thing, what was the story, what was the reason that got me started on this journey? And as you tell that story, and you get people the same epiphany that you had, that's when you're able to change their destiny, that's when you're able to help them, okay? So that's the epiphany and the big stuff. If you wanna go deeper now, I talk a lot about an expert's secrets, but that's the core of story. And so for you, it's not coming back and trying to logically convince anybody of anything. It's remembering like, what was the reason that I got so excited about this? And sharing that story is what's gonna get people to connect with you, and then they're gonna have this epiphany you had if you do it right, and now you can change it, now you can affect it, now you can move them, okay? All right, so there's the story framework. Now, the next part of story is you have to understand that when we are telling people a story, everyone already has a story, right? About whatever it is, and so if their story is positive, it's a really good thing for them, but the story's negative, it's holding them back, okay? So our job as marketers, as funnel hackers, is to look at that and say, okay, this story they have, is it holding them back from what I know that they need to be doing? If so, that story is the chain of false beliefs, it's holding them back, right? So they have this chain of false beliefs. Now, some experience, something happened to them that made them have these false beliefs, okay? So there's this experience, and because of that experience, they've been telling themselves the story over and over and over again. So for you, this is the people you're coming in contact with. They're seeing your Facebook ads, they're coming on your webinars, they're hitting your landing pages, they're reading your emails, and they have these things. And if you don't break these false chains of beliefs, no matter how hard you try, you will never convince them to follow you. It's impossible, right? Because they have this story. So the only way for you to break them from these false chains of belief is to tell them your story, and if you do this right, then your story trumps their story, and then your story becomes theirs, okay? So let me give you an example. So this is my friend Devon, he has met him a little earlier today. By the way, did you love his socks? That was amazing. Anyway, so Devon, last year, he was like, Russell, this is amazing, I got an opportunity for you. It's gonna be ground floor opportunity, it's gonna be amazing, it's gonna change the world, it's gonna be awesome. And I'm like, wait, man, I'm in. So Devon signs me up, he's like, all right, your first thing you need to do, see Jim and Pam over there? You gotta get them signed up. I'm like, okay, let's do this, okay? So now I'm looking through this lens, okay? So I'm gonna sign Jim and Pam up. Now I look at Jim and I'm like, okay, Jim has got some false chains of belief. There's some reason I'm not gonna be able to get him to believe that he should join my network marketing opportunity, right? What is that? He's got these false chains of belief. So I gotta think like, what did he experience that probably kept him from doing that? Like, did he have a friend or a family member who came in annoyed or someone who like, or did he have a bad, did he already join a program and he just felt uncomfortable? What was the experience he had? Okay, so Jim's experience, what happened is he had a friend named Michael Scott who just tackled them and forced him to be in this program, right? He's like, oh, that was a horrible experience. I did not feel comfortable. I did not like it. And so because of that, he created a story inside of his mind. And the story he created inside of his mind is that all network marketing programs are pyramid schemes, okay? So that's the story he created. So I can come in here, I can tell him everything I wanted about ground floor opportunity, the best product, the best technology, the best everything, no matter what I do, logically sell them. He will never break that story. It's not worth doing. Okay, now I'm sharing the story for network marketing. It's true for every single one of you guys. I don't care if you're selling fitness, finance, products, services, like whatever it is, it's what's happening. Customers have a story already, okay? So if the only way for you to break their story is you have to come in, you have to tell a better story that Trump's theirs. Okay, so if I was going to Jim, I'd be like, hey man, so why are you joining? He's like, oh, this annoying friend, you bugged me. It was horrible. And if I joined, I got to bug people. And I just don't want to do it. And like, no, that makes sense. I was the same way. But what's interesting is that I found out about this really cool thing called the funnel. And I used the funnel. There was this network marketing program. I believed it was pretty cool. And they were giving away a Ferrari. And I was like, what if I won a Ferrari without ever talking to anybody ever? That would be amazing. And so I set up a funnel, I launched it. And in 60 days, I became the number one money earner in the company and I won this Ferrari. And the best thing is I didn't talk to a single person ever. Isn't that amazing? Now, if I tell Jim that if my story Trump's his story, he's gonna be like, oh my gosh. She's saying I could actually have the benefit of this thing without talking to people. You'd sign me up. Okay. That's what you have to understand. That's all this whole story things about. It's about trumping someone else's false belief. I can trump their false belief. Their story shifts and now your story becomes theirs. And now they're free. The chains of false belief are gone. Now they're free to go pursue whatever it is you're trying to help them pursue. Okay. All right. So the question is then, what stories do I tell? Now this is gonna change. We talked about Hook's story offer. Depending on the complexity of the product depends on how many stories you tell and what stories you tell, right? If it's a very simple product, you tell us story and that's all you need. For more complex things, you have to tell multiple stories. I'm gonna kind of walk through that. So the first thing you have to understand is that in every sales argument, there is what we call the big domino. Okay. Again, if you're an expert, secrets to talk about this. There's one thing that if I can get them to believe that one thing, all the other concerns just disappear instantly, right? Okay. So when you guys came into my world, the whole funnel world, okay, everyone had false beliefs and things and things you believed on everything. But if I could somehow convince you that the only way for you to get your goals was a funnel, like you have to just kind of like, all right, well, I'm in. Like I gotta do it, right? Everything else just falls away. Okay, so for me, it's like, if I can convince people that a funnel is the way, is the only way for them to actually get the results they want, then it knocks down all the other dominoes. All the other dominoes fall away or they become irrelevant, okay? And every sales argument has the same thing, okay? When you're selling something, it's not about trying to answer every single concern possible. It's figuring out what's the one big domino. If I can address this in my ad, in my video, in my webinar, in my whatever, if I can address this, if I can prove that this is true, then all the other dominoes fall down and they have to believe me, right? And so for all of you guys who have that, I'm excited, Jamie's gonna talk about hers tomorrow, I believe, like in hers, she figured out, what was the thing she had to get people to believe? And boom, it all fell down, okay? So you gotta figure that out. Now, after you know the big domino, for your product, your service, then it comes down to there's four stories we typically tell. Now I'm gonna show you guys this in a framework of like a webinar. And so I'm gonna show 15 minutes, I'm gonna show kind of how we do it in a 90 minute webinar. But the same thing happens on a five minute webinar. It's the same process, just shorter times, okay? So the first story we tell is what we call the origin story. Again, the origin story is basically your Pifty Bridge story. How did you find out about this thing? Like, why do you care so much about it? Right? So you tell your story. So if I'm doing a webinar, the first 15 minutes of my webinar is me just telling my origin story, okay? My Pifty Bridge story about how I fell in love with this thing. Okay? So if you're watching any of the webinars, these are the slides from the Funnel Hacks webinar that most of you guys have probably seen. The first 15 minutes I'm going through this, I'm just telling my Pifty Bridge story about, oh my gosh, Funnel is the greatest in the world. Let me explain to you why they are. And I tell you my whole story, okay? And that's the first goal. Now what happens is after I tell that story, for some people, that was it. Domino falls over and like, I'm in. I need, here's my mic. In fact, I'm curious, how many of you guys, when you first heard me talk about potato guns and funnels and I told the first story, you're like, I'm 100% in. Right? My hyperactives are like in, okay? Now click for all of this is a more complex cell. On a simpler cell, it's easy. How many of you guys, if I just told you my origin story with Vigon here, if I told you, and I've never had a cold source, this isn't actually true, but if I told you like, look, I've had cold source in the past. I've used a brief, I've used things, nothing ever works. They always last for two or three weeks at a time. It's horrible, it's painful, like the worst thing in the world. When I found out about this the first time I tried it, I clicked on the thing, I pulled it out, and I felt it tingling like the first day, but it never came out, never became a cold source, it was just gone, that was it. And ever since I keep this in my pocket, I take it everywhere I go, and as soon as the cold source comes out, I hit it, and I had my cold source actually hit surface since then. How many of you guys, that story alone had been like, sweet, I'm in. Okay? If someone who suffers cold source, like our cell's video for this is literally that. That's it, this is a $150 machine. It's a video, two minutes long telling an origin story, the person who actually mentioned it, and that's it, that's all it takes. Okay, so for simple products, one story, the origin story is all you need and people are in. Okay? But as you get more complex offers, you need more. So what happens is there are more complex offer, they push the domino over and they're all excited, all of a sudden, they push it, but then like, oh, these three things block it. It's like, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, I'm in, but, and all of a sudden, these three things block it, okay? So these are the three things. So the first thing, the first thing, these are what we call the three core faults, please. The first thing is their beliefs about the vehicle. Okay, so the vehicle is the thing you're trying to put them into. So for me, the vehicle is funnels, like this is the world I'm trying to take you guys into. For some of you guys, it's a ketogenic diet, some of you guys, it's a product that can help you with your coles, it's like there's some belief about the vehicle they have, they struggle with. The second belief is their own internal beliefs, like that may be cool, but like, I don't think I could do it. Have you guys ever heard that voice in your head before? That's cool for them, but I don't know if I could do it. Right? And then the third fault's belief is like, well, that's cool, I think I could do it, but like, I know that if I started this diet, like I could do it, but my wife's gonna buy cookies anyway, they're gonna be in the house, there's no way, like they always blame it on some external source besides themselves. Okay? So these are the three things that keep people from buying from you. Okay? So for me now, now I move into it, I tell a story to try to trump all three of those. Okay, and if I can trump all three of those beliefs, their beliefs become my beliefs, then they have to buy, they have to follow, you have to do the thing you need them to do. Okay? So story number two then, which in a webinar, is the next 15 minutes, is the story about my vehicle. Okay, so Sandy, I come back here, I say, okay, what's the chain of fault's belief they currently have about the vehicle that I'm putting them into? Okay? Then what's the experience, like why do they believe that? Then what's the story they're currently telling themselves? And I think, okay, what's my story? Okay, so, oh, you guys will see this video tomorrow. So I gotta show them the websites are dead, right? So for me, if I go back to this for myself, right? The fault's belief is like, why don't you have a website? I'm good, right? Or, my stuff's on Amazon, I'm good. Why do you believe that? Well, I tried to build a funnel, it was really complicated, I didn't work. I flew myself on Amazon and I make some cells, that's pretty cool. So story is like, I don't need any complicated stuff, I can just use Amazon, right? So I gotta come back and the story I tell you is like, no, websites are dead, I tell the story, and if I did a good job, boom, it falls down. Okay, so in my funnel hacks webinar, the most you guys have seen, these slides right here, all me telling the story about why this vehicle is the greatest thing in the world. My epiphany bridge to about why I believe that. I tell that story, and the end of it, my goal is something like, oh my gosh, I do need a funnel. If I get to say that in their head, I do need a funnel, boom, the internal belief, or the vehicle belief is gone. Okay, oh my gosh, I could have success here. Oh my gosh, I could do that thing, okay? So my story's Trump's there, it's once again the Domino Falls, okay? Now, the next thing, so the first one's the origin story, second one's the story about the vehicle, the next one now moves down to the internal beliefs. So they say, oh my gosh, your right, a funnel is amazing, but I can't do it, it comes internal. I can't do it, I don't have any technical skills. I don't know how to build something, I don't even know what a funnel is for crying out loud, right? So that's the second story, so now, excuse me, the third story. So now I come back and I say, okay, what's the false belief, why do they believe that? Well, they believe that for me, again, I'm talking about why a product would plug in your product for this. For me, it's like, well, I've tried technical stuff in the past, I can't even use Microsoft Word. I'm like, I'm gonna build a funnel. That's what they believe, well, it's the experience, I tried to do the thing, it didn't work, it was confusing, like I waste time and energy. The story is like, I'm not technical, I can't build a funnel. So I gotta come in and be like, no, like it's actually really easy, here's Grant Cardone, this guy is the least technical guy on earth, he built an entire funnel, 40,000 beneath, it was super simple, super easy, and they see that and they're like, oh, that actually is really easy, I guess I could do that. So now, boom, two things have happened, right? And then here's my slides where I tell that part of the story, okay? So now it's happened, hopefully a nominal fail. If not, then the last leg, so first they say, cool, the vehicle, funnels is amazing, I think I could actually do it, but I don't, they find the external thing, I don't know how to drive traffic, so I actually, I probably couldn't figure it out. Okay, they have some kind of external belief, okay? So for me, the external belief is, even if I had a funnel, what would I do with it? I don't know how to do, like I can't get people to come to the funnel, what's their experience? I had a website before, I spent a ton of money on it, bought some Google ads, nobody showed up, and I'm broke, I paid an agency, 5,000 bucks, and we got like three visitors, I never made any money, right? They have some experience, the story is, this doesn't work, so I gotta tell them my story, so for me, I tell a story about how do we get traffic, and boom, I go through my slides, I tell that part of the story, and if it works, boom, the domino falls, and then they follow me, and for all of you guys who are here, obviously domino fail, that's why we've got 4,500 amazing people here, because I was able to break the false police that are holding us back, that make sense? Okay, so after you've told the stories, then the last thing is that you move over to the offer, so I tell the stories, I break all the false beliefs, I move to the offer, I go through the sack and the clothes, make the special offer, and boom, we got them, okay? So the framework is simple, there's one big domino, I gotta convince them that's one thing, for me, I gotta convince them that funnels is the greatest thing in the world, for you, whatever your thing is, like you gotta convince them that this type of diet, this type of lifestyle, this type of product, is the greatest thing in the world, what's the big domino? If you can give them to believe this, then they have to follow you, figure that out, and then it's come back, hey, why do I believe that? What's my origins, why do I actually believe that? And if you don't believe it, you're in the wrong business. Okay, you have to believe it at your depth of your soul if you're gonna get people to move with you, okay? So then you tell your story, and then you're like, okay, no, what's the reason, like, what's the vehicle I'm putting, but what's the false beliefs about that? What's the false beliefs about themselves being able to implement this? What's the false beliefs about the extra? You tell those three stories, and then you make them the offer, okay? That's kinda how it works. All right, now I wanna do something for some of you guys who are watching this, and it's like, well, Russell, that's awesome for you because you click on Facebook Live, and you just go, and you have all this energy, and you're amazing, and you just sell everybody every single time. Have you guys ever felt that way about me before? You're like, I hate that, Russell Brunson. Okay, so I have a special message for all you guys. We're all gonna laugh at me together. So I shared this on Instagram, and this is kind of embarrassing, but how many of you guys wanna see the very first time I spoke on stage? Look at that good looking dude, his bald head, and his puffy shirt, and his tie. All right, so this is the very first time I ever spoke on stage, it's like a 30 second clip, and I'm going through this humiliation to hopefully have some of you guys look at this, be like, oh my gosh, that guy can do this? Gary and Jack can do it, so here we go. But what I wanted to talk about tonight is kind of a broad overview, hopefully to help you to better, to get better information out of the whole internet marketing business. This is a lot bigger group than I had planned on. So embarrassing. All right, so that was the first time I ever spoke. The next day was the first time somebody let me step on their stage, except for it was like carpet, there was no actual stage, and they're like, you can sell something, I'm like sweet. And so the next day, I had a chance to make my very first offer on stage. And I'm not gonna show you guys the whole thing, because it's really like, the very beginning, as I transitioned to me trying to sell, I was like, how much do you guys think I'm gonna sell this for? And some guy was like, a thousand bucks. And I was like, oh crap, I'm actually selling it for a thousand bucks. I was like, well, it was so bad. Oh, anyway, so. You guys are gonna see my closing abilities round one. Here we go. Okay, I've got, am I getting close on time? If you do join the affiliate bootcamp, it'll give you lifelong training. It's a $47 a month value, you'll get it for free. Who would like a piece of that? Here's my irresistible offer. And I hope you guys learned a lot from this presentation. I'm a standing ovation, you did a great job. Look at this, nobody stands up, not one person. Who wants a piece of that? The greatest close of all time. All right, so I share that for any of you guys who are just like, I don't know if this is gonna work. I'm shy, I'm awkward, I'm nervous. Like I promise you, I was shy, I was awkward, I'm nervous. I still am, I still struggle. But when you believe in what it is you have to sell, you believe what you're doing, like you just keep doing it and keep doing it and you get a little bit better and a little bit better and a little bit better. And it didn't take 15 years, right? Every single time I got better and a couple more people started listening, a couple more people started listening and started growing and started growing and started growing. The biggest thing you have to start, you have to start telling the stories, you can't wait. Like, oh, I'm gonna start stories next month, next week, next year. Okay, it's like, no, start today. Can we just have a phone again? No one's raising their hand. How many of you guys have a phone in your pocket right now? Okay, you have no excuse. If you wanna do a podcast, there's a podcast app, you click on it, you talk and then you click a button and it's on iTunes that fast. You wanna do a video, you click a button and then you're on Facebook Live in five seconds. Or Instagram, like, you have no excuses. But Russell, no one's following me. Like, exactly, that's the best thing about it at the beginning. Who was there for that event when I spoke? None of you guys were there. Ha ha, other than all you guys now saw. But none of you were there, right? Do you guys understand? Like, just start. Your people will find you. As you find your voice, your people will find you. But you cannot find your voice until you start, until you begin, until you start moving forward. Okay, and if I would have started that journey 15 years ago, none of you guys would be here today. Okay, and if I could go back to that awkward, nerdy Russell with a shaved head and a tie who was scared to death of getting on stage, sitting behind like scared to death. And I could go back to my now-adagrabe and say, look, dude, I know this is uncomfortable and it's horrible and it's miserable and you are scared and you are gonna fail and you're gonna fail and you're gonna fail and not one year or two years. It's gonna be like a decade of this. But in a decade from now, you're gonna have a chance to come on stage and for the 4,500 people, you're gonna have an opportunity and a voice to be able to change their lives if you don't stop. I would hope that I would have listened. Thank you. The biggest thing is I can't have you guys stopping. Okay, I was telling Brandon Paul in this yesterday, I saw him at the Inner Circle Dinner. Four funnel hacking lives ago, the second funnel hacking live, he was sitting down inside, never met him before. And during one of the roundtables, the other roundtub came over and he was like, hey man, really quick, I need to interrupt. I'm like, what's going on? He's like, just so you know, you've changed my life, you changed my wife's life. I was like, oh cool, thank you. He's like, no, no, you don't understand. He's like, we're helping people, we're making money. Like everything's changed for us. Okay, I was like, that's amazing. And Brandon was one person in the audience, him and his wife were sitting there. Fast forward four years now later, Katelyn's unfortunately not here, she had her first baby, which congratulations to the Poland family, it's amazing. Fast forward four years later, because Katelyn kept talking and sharing your message over and over and over again. And then like 1.5 million people have come into their funnels, over 130,000 women's lives have been changed because of them. They're making a sane amount of money, but the impact they're having on the world is huge because they were sitting in the audience, they heard us talk about this and then they just did it. So for me and for my team, I had to talk to them yesterday before we got started. So look, there's a sea of people out here. Every single one of them has a voice and the ability to change somebody's lives. And if we can't affect them, then everything we're doing here is a waste. This event's not about me, it's not about us, it's not about my team, it's about each and every one of you guys. And we're trying to give you the tools and the things you need, but you have to listen and you have to be willing to try it. And it's gonna be scary at first, I promise you that. It's still scary to me, I was backstage here freaking out a few minutes ago. Okay, I feel a little more comfortable now, luckily. We have to understand like it's gonna be scary, but if you don't do it, if you don't take that step, you're not gonna be here next year. Okay, I don't want you to just here next year, I want you up here next year. I want you telling your story, getting your awards, that's why we do this every single day. Okay, all right, a couple more things. All right, just so you guys understand again, if you're selling a product, you don't have to do this huge thing, the simpler the product, the easier it is. For example, do you guys see that picture right there? You see that marker in my hand? Okay, if I was gonna say, how many of you guys will give me, I don't know, five bucks for this marker right now? Yeah. A couple of you guys. Okay, I'm gonna tell you guys a story about this marker. I'm gonna tell you a story and the story will increase the value of this marker, okay? So, a couple of, when we first were starting new events, I remember I would show up and they always had those like little narrow white boards and they're like, horizontal or vertical. And we draw funnels, funnels are vertical, right? So you're like, page number one, page number one, you're like, I'm out of space. Like, you flip it and it's like horrible to diagram with funnels, right? And I would do that, I would flip them thing over, flipping it over, I had these little tiny markers and they're like little tiny and like, you can't see it very far and it just felt weak. And then I went to Tony Robbins' event and Tony had a board like this. And then he pulls out this marker and Tony's hands are like this big anyway. And he pulls out this marker and he unsheaths it. Whoa, he walks over to the white board and he starts doing this thing and he's like, just like doing X's and like circles and like, it wasn't making no sense whatsoever but it looks so cool. And I remember I was like, oh my gosh, this is amazing. And so, when we started in funnel hiking lives, first off I wanted to, Tony had a board like this white, we need a board like that. And I tried for like years to find one. I remember one day I was like complaining to Melanie, who's my assistant, I was like, Melanie, like how did he, he must have custom built this thing. And then she's like in Google or doing some magic and like five and six, like found it, like what? And next thing we know, we have this board here. And then like I do the board the very first time I had these little tiny markers and I'm like, I feel so weak, I want to feel like Tony, I need like a man marker. And so she starts Googling and she finds some markers, ship them like, no, these are good, but like I need like Tony man markers. And so finally she finds these things and look at this thing like, this thing is amazing. And so these are now my man markers. And I only like, I will not speak at events. When I travel to events, I bring my man markers because I don't want to be on stage like little dainty ones. And so I had these huge man markers. And so I've got red man markers, blue man markers, black man markers, and I only have three of them here right now, how many of you want a man marker? Okay, I can't sell these, we have to have these for the rest of the event. But do you see how a story increases the value? That's what I'm talking about. Like you tell a good story increases the value whatever you're selling. So you have to come better at telling stories. You have to be better at making offers, better at telling stories, because both those things intrinsically increase the value of what it is you're trying to sell. Now when you're selling more complex offers, that's when you need to have a bigger thing. We're having internal beliefs, the vehicle, internal, external, the more complex the product is, the longer the sales process is. All right, so for you guys, your homework as well in your paper here, is to start right now, you just need to start building a story inventory. What are all the false beliefs that my customers have? And start writing those things down like, and then why do they believe that? What's the story they're telling themselves? And then what story do I have that would trump their belief? Okay, I've been telling this, ever since the expert secret just came out, almost two years ago, I've been talking about this over and over and over again. Very few people do it. But guess what? I know the people that are doing it. I'm watching them, I'm watching the story, telling them, watching what they're doing, I'm watching the process. I do this all the time. When I got started, Dan Kennedy told me this, he's like, you need to build inventory of stories. And I heard that, instead of doing it, most people didn't say that's a good idea. I said, Dan said it. I must do it. Got a pad of paper. I was like, what stories do I have? And I had nothing. I had a potato gun story, that was it. So I wrote down my potato gun story, I'm like, ah, that's all I got. But now I had my notebook with my potato gun story and I started thinking, okay, as I start talking, as I start doing my thing, something amazing happened in my life. I'm like, that could be a story, write it down. And then the next thing, something's happened, something's happened. And I was like, oh my gosh, that could be a story, write it down. It could be a story, write it down. Could it be a story? The next thing I know, I can stand in the station for 90 minutes and I have 400 stories without even knowing about it. It comes down to just telling story after story after story. But you have to start that now. So if you have your phone, open up a note, say my story inventory. And as you are living life, every time something's happening, nobody's like, oh, that was cool. They're like, oh, that was cool. How did that relate to my customers? Oh my gosh, if I sold this, that's how it relates, boom. How many of us thought I could tell a story about a marker and make it relevant to you somehow? Yeah, I did, right? It's all about that. Okay, hook story offer. Okay, I'm gonna go to the last steps. We're talking about offer. We're talking about story. The last piece in this is the hook. Okay, so what is the hook? To understand this really well, I want you guys to imagine what happened right before you probably came into this room. You were in the bathroom and you were sitting kind of like this. And most of you had your phones and you're going like this. So what a hook is, it's the thing that makes you stop. Like, whoa, that's a hook. This is how I judge my hooks. I imagine all of you guys swiping and what's gonna make you like, whoa, hold on. All right, I gotta finish so I can find out what that thing is, okay? This is literally what's happening. In case you're wondering like, oh no, my customers don't do that, they do. I was in the airport two days ago. I walk into the airport and for the women, I'm so sorry that you have to find out about how gross and disgusting men are. But there's the dude swiping while he's, and I was like, seriously, like putting your pocket for 30 seconds, it doesn't take that long. It was just amazing. Like, that's what they're doing, okay? And so you gotta imagine, this is what's happening in today's world. Okay, so now they're seeing their desktop, like studying you and reading things. Excuse me, and researching, what's happening is this. And so they're flipping through their phone and they're seeing their friends and their pictures and their profiles and their cat videos and thing after thing after thing after thing and your ad has a shot in there for like one second, probably less, in the middle of the scroll, okay? If you don't stop them right there and they don't say, hold on, put the phone down, I gotta come back and check this out, you failed. Okay, the hook is the key. Without a good hook, nobody will ever hear your story. Without a good story, no one will care about your offer. Okay, now the hook in and of itself does not provide, does not increase the value. Okay, the hook does not increase the value of what it is you're selling. What the hook does is it grabs your attention long enough that it'll listen to your story. The story increases the value and then the offer increases the value. The hook grabs them just long enough, you can tell them the story, okay? So every story you have has multiple hooks. Okay, it's so important for you guys to be publishing and putting things out there all the time because I have no idea what hooks are gonna land, which ones are people gonna resonate with and which ones don't, okay? I was at a retreat, like a mastermind group with Brendan Bouchard and Dean Grasio, seen a bunch of really cool people, both of who are gonna be here this weekend speaking with you guys. It's gonna be amazing. And we're sitting on the campfire and Dean told the story that was so good. He said, essentially he said, if you look at a comedian, you see them on the Tonight Show and they pick up the microphone, they do their thing and they do the thing and they land it. And everyone's like, oh my gosh, this is the funniest person on earth. And so the guy who understands, the comedian just get up there and do his thing. What happened is two years prior, he went to a dive bar over here, he wrote 10 jokes, got in front of 30 people, and he tried his thing and he tried it. And he told joke one, two, three, four, five, like one of the 10 jokes landed. He's like, okay, that joke was good, the rest were horrible. Goes back to his department, writes nine new jokes, got 10 new jokes, goes next to the dive bar, gets in front of it, boom, he does it. Nails the first joke, he knows this amazing. Nails the other nine, like two of them, the other nine work, right? Now he's got three good jokes. Then he goes back, rewrites the other seven, comes back the next night, boom, he keeps doing it, keeps doing it, keeps doing it, keeps doing it, he knows he's got 10 of the most amazing jokes in the world. Then he gets on the big stage and performs in every single joke lands. Okay, it's the same thing what we're doing right now. I have no idea what hooks are gonna work, right? So what do I do? When I hear a story in the morning, I jump on my phone, I get my phone out as I'm driving to the office and half you guys are like, Russell, don't drive while you're podcasting. It's like a block and there's no anything anywhere. I wish I could show people that. I get anywhere, whatever. So I'm doing my thing, talking, and I tell the story, right? That's my first time. Then I come in, I see Dave, and Dave's like, oh, and I'm like, oh, I tell your story. I tell Dave the story, right? I tell a little differently this time. And I'm like, okay, that works. Like, it made sense, you got excited. And I go out to the bullpen and all the marketing teams and I tell them the story, right? And then I jump on a Facebook app, I tell the story, I tell it four or five times so I know how to tell the story. I see what lands, I see what hooks, got people interested. Or if I tell a story and Dave's like, oh, that's really cool. I'm like, crap. Dave's not flipping out is not a good story, right? And that's how we know. So it's testing these things, testing it, testing it. Okay, so when you have a story, it's like you're putting out different hooks. Like which of the hooks that people are grabbing onto? What are the ones that are interesting? What ones do people actually pay attention to? And I'm like, cool, now we'll build things bigger on those. Okay, but you gotta be practicing stuff all the time. Cause if you're like, I gotta get this business has to work. It's gotta be perfect. It's gotta be, I don't wanna screw this up. So I'm gonna wait until I tell my story, I'm gonna wait, I'm gonna wait. It's the equivalent of walking up on this night showing me like, I never tested this material. Let's go. You would never do that, right? Yeah, we do in our businesses all the time. You can't do that. You gotta be telling the stories, telling the stories. Okay, every single one of you guys in here should be Facebook Live-ing your experience today. Like seriously, if you're not, like why did you waste that experience? There's some story that will impact you today. If not me by somebody else that affects your life and your customers directly. And you better be talking about that tonight when you get home. You have a podcasting video, Facebook Live-something to start practicing. It begins tonight. Doesn't begin, manana, cause manana never comes. Okay, all right, so how do you find the hooks that you wanna model? So next time you guys are doing this, and you shouldn't do this, like it's really disgusting, but maybe you're your desk doing this. As you're scrolling through, look at the stuff that stops you. Okay, look at the stuff that stops you, like why did that hook work? What was it? Okay, the 30 days book was not my idea. Someone else had a 30 days thing in another industry. I was like, that's a good idea. He hooked it over there, I'm gonna hook it over here. Cause it made me stop. Okay, now after you find an ad, instead of just looking at it, like that's a really good ad, then you go to the ad and Facebook is on the coolest thing in the world now. There's a little tab here, it says ads and info. You click on it and it literally shows you every single hook that that person is running right now. So you click on that right now, you would see here's a couple of the hooks that Russell and John and the team are currently running. Russell, that's a lot of ads. Yeah, worth throwing out insane amounts of hooks every single day, okay? And you can do this with any advertiser. You see their ad on Facebook, you click on their thing and it'll show you here's every ad that they are actively running right now. And you can see all the hooks. So every time someone hooks you, stop, pay attention, go look at the thing, look at all the ads. You start studying and start looking and start geeking out. Okay, that's a lot of ads. How many do we have on here? All right, now this is, I was doing this last night like one in the morning I used to work on slides. I was like, how do I really sink this in? And I started thinking about the two comic club winners and two comic club X winners. I was like, I wanna show you some examples of some of these, right? Cause you hear these people all the time, right? You see their pictures, you hear the stories, you're like, this is amazing. I want two comic club. But how many guys have actually looked at the hooks that they're throwing out? Okay, if they're in the two comic club, two comic club X means they are insanely good at hook story offer, otherwise they would not be here. Right, so we should be looking at, so I started looking at them. I'm gonna pull a couple random people. So the first one I pull here is Drew. Is Drew in the room right now? I think he is. All right, so this is amazing. So Drew is coming out fit to fat to fit. Have you guys seen his ads before? So Drew is a personal trainer. He was ripped and amazing. I might be telling the story wrong. It's awkward, these are in the room. So hopefully I tell it right. But he was like ripped and amazing. And his clients are like, well, you've never been fat so you don't know what it's like. And he's like, oh yeah, this is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna get fat, super fat. So he gained a whole bunch of weight to prove to everyone who went from being fit to getting really fat and then losing all the weight again. Okay, probably not healthy, like in retrospect I'm guessing, but that is an amazing hook. So you see, here's every, a thousand different weight loss offers out there. They're like, hey, I'm sexy, I'm ripped. And you see Drew sitting here with Jay Leno. He's like, I went from being fit to fat to fit and shows it before ads like, that hook is amazing. Okay, boom, two comic books, okay? This is Natalie, have you guys remember Natalie Hudson from last year? There's Natalie right here. Okay, two comic book winners, she's getting close to two comic book X. Same thing, right? No, it's interesting. So Natalie's business prior to this was a good business, right? She had good hooks, good story, good offer. It was like, it was doing well, but never like amazing, right? But then she came back and she's like, hey, what's the hook, what's the strike, what is it? And she shifted from her other business that was doing okay to this. And you guys remember Natalie's story? She talked about vulnerability last year. She talked about she was doing this live video and she peter pants during it, which is like the most humiliating thing ever, right? And then she turned that into a product teaching women how to control that and went from zero to two comic book winner in four months. Because the hook, right? Find a better hook. Again, if your funnel's not working, it's always either hook a story or an offer. Okay, that hooks amazing, her story is insane and the offer was amazing, million dollars in four months. Okay, Garrett White there in the middle. Here's the landing page I found of his, one of my favorite landing pages. How's this for a hook? Attention, married businessmen. Learn how to unlock, okay. Learn how to unlock nearly unlimited sex, power, money without having to cheat on your wife, get a divorce, ignore your children, leave your church, date with drugs or part of like a rocks to her in Las Vegas. What? How do you not click on that as a man? I can have everything I want in life with not all the bad stuff. This is amazing, right? He's a master at hooks. If you look at anybody in this clubs, right? Anyone who's on stage, people that are doing what they want to do, you guys, they're amazing at hook story offer. If you want to be on stage, you have to become better at hook story and offer, okay? So as you're telling your story, you can start building inventory. What are the hooks I can test out? Test out this, test out this. And my question is how many hooks are you guys actually throwing out? You need to be throwing out a lot, okay? Hook story offer. And then one last thing I want to show you guys, if you look at this hook story offer, this is happening at every single step in your funnel. Okay, your ads, there's a hook, a story and an offer in your ad. Someone's scrolling, there's a hook, you're telling a quick story, you're making an offer. Click here, there's the offer. Then they come to your landing page, there's a hook, there's a story, there's an offer. Then they come to buy your product, hook story offer, upsell hook story offer. Like this framework is essential for you guys to master. It's so simple. If I want to start today, it's so simple, but it's the most important thing. You do it over and over and over and over again. If something is not working inside your funnel, it's always either your hook, your story, or your offer. Okay, I don't care what funnel it is. We're gonna learn about a ton of funnel types this weekend. Okay, you're gonna learn it out. Challenge funnels and summit funnels and book funnel, all the hundred funnels, doesn't matter which one it is, this framework fits into every one of these funnels. Okay, and the last one that it mentions, the hook story offer, this is the key. Hook story offers are the thing that grabs somebody, brings them into your world, and after you have them, the next phase then, is how do we increase the value? How do we help these people along the line? Okay, in the books you guys got yesterday, I actually printed out a copy of our value out. So you guys see, this is our value ladder. And the person speaking after me is Stacy Martino. I'm so excited to have her. She's gonna be, yeah, you guys are gonna love Stacy. But she is a master at taking people up to value. Like how do you take people? After you've hooked them and you got them into your world, how do you love them and give them enough value they wanna continue to progress to do throughout everything else you're doing?
