Hey, my name is Russell Brunson. I want to welcome you to my channel. I'm so excited to have you here. If you could take a moment really quick and click on the subscribe button, that way I can send you really cool videos like this in the future. But today I'm going to be talking about a five-part video series I'm doing right now. It was actually an interview I did with this man right here. Go! His head got really big. Ty Lopez. And I was actually in California. This was a couple months ago. I was out in California. And I actually had met his tie. And he said, hey, come on over to the tie mansion. Hang out. And we'll do an interview. So I got there super late. And I was like 11.30 at night. I'm like, well, there's no way we're doing this interview. And sure, if we showed up, he fed me. And then about 1 o'clock in the morning, if you've ever been to Ty's house or seen it, he broke out like 400 cameras. He had cell phones, a glor for Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, networks I'd never even heard of. And we did this interview and turned out really, really cool. And I wanted to share it with you. So the very first part of this interview, Ty's asked me about how we built ClickFunnels from zero to $100 million. And the first thing we talked about is how you actually build a movement. I talked about the movement that ClickFunnels has built. We talked about some of our success stories, like Lady Boss and the movement they've created and a whole bunch of other stuff. So with that said, let's jump into part one of this interview series with me and Ty Lopez. Russell, take me back. Three years ago, you decided to launch this company, ClickFunnels, which are you now number two? I mean, number one competitor was Shopify? I think so. I don't know what else is in close. So pretty sure. And you did this. You have five kids. You live in Idaho. For all of you who live in smaller markets and you don't think you can make any money. So what was the feeling to go from zero and three years later, we're doing $100 million a year? That was never the goal. I mean, the goal is to try to do whatever. But it's funny, because about four years ago, when we had the idea and we're like, okay, can we do this? Like a lot of people tried it before. I had tried it before. Luckily, I had a co-founder, Todd Dickerson, who was technically able to build it and spent about a year building it. And then it came back and it was just amazing. And so I'm like, all right, let's sell this. And so that's my job to be the guy selling it, talking about like how to sell, how do people excited about it? And then when it started working and then starting success stories, people have success a bit more and start growing and growing. And yeah, the last three years has been nuts. So let's go through this marking because a lot of people who listen or listening in are people who have an idea and they wanna grow it. One of your secrets is not just selling a product but creating a movement. It's telling me about that. That's cause that's really your number. I asked you, number one thing you think is responsible for growth and those of you listening should emulate. You've written this book called Experts Secrets. You got Robert Kiyosaki on the front cover recommending it and the underground playbook to find your message, build a tribe and change the world. So why do people need to build a tribe? How do you do it? The market we're going into, there's a lot of competitors, right? And all of them are like, they're brands but they're kinda nameless faces. Brands trying to do this thing, right? And I remember about that time I went to a network marketing thing cause I had some friends in it and I was like, I wanna see how these guys do their stuff. I show up in this room and there's like four or 5,000 people in this room and everyone's going on stage and they're crying. I'm so confused. I'm like, this is a software company. Why are people crying? And like first step to personal truth, three days and I'm so confused and finally I look over to one of my buddies tonight and I'm like, and he said to me, he said, do you know what they're doing here? And I was like, I had no idea but everyone's crying. I'm confused. He said they didn't build the software companies. Like they created a movement. That's why people are here. That's why they're coming. And this is the time of the year. So they're saying they built the movement before they even brand in this concept. Yeah, as they were doing it and so we were launching ClickFunnels and I was like, if we're just a software company, like everybody else, then we're a commodity, right? And if you're a commodity then it's like everybody's fighting for like the lowest price and eventually you price yourself out and then it's just like, that's how a lot of businesses happen and I was like, we need to build something bigger where people are part of this movement and they're part of our tribe and they belong to this thing. And so about that time we were launching ClickFunnels and again, at first it didn't take off like I thought it was. And I remember about two or three months into it I did a presentation about a concept we called funnel hacking, which is like, go we find somebody else has a funnel, you look at it and then you model inside of ClickFunnels. And our people started calling themselves funnel hackers and I was like, okay, this is like the thing we can, so I was like, hey, we're funnel hackers. We're start making t-shirts and everyone that's signed up for our software, make them watch a 10 minute video showing how to use ClickFunnels, we mill a t-shirt to say funnel hacker. Almost every week since we launched ClickFunnels there's been like, the next ClickFunnels killer that's coming out and everyone, I get all the emails from everyone forward and they go, oh, the competitor's coming out. And so far I think it's been like 30 something that have come out and all of them have just kind of fallen by the wayside and didn't do much. You think that's because they weren't movements like yours? Yeah, well I asked some of my members, I'm like, how come you guys don't try their software? Why aren't you switching over? And they said, because we're part of, like this is not your company, Russell, this is us. Like we're funnel hackers, ClickFunnels is our tool. Like this is who we are. And they said, one guy I remember told me, he's like, I look at the ad in my Facebook feed just long enough to laugh and then I scroll on because I know that I'm a funnel hacker and I'm part of this movement. And they don't even, and so it's like, everyone's coming trying to beat us on pricing and things like that. It's like, no, we built a community, we built a tribe of people who have a belief they're going somewhere, there's a vision of what they're all trying to do. And that has been so huge in propelling us to this growth. They also share, I mean, we get organically about 1,000 people a day, they're signing for ClickFunnels. And that's not coming from our paid ads. These are paid customers, by the way, 55,000 paid customers. Not the free ones, like most offer. Your free email list is probably, how big do you share it? Over a million. Over a million. And we probably had about 500,000 or so that have actually created an account, but yeah, 55,000, they're actively paying you. And it costs between what? Between $100 and $300 a month. $100 and $300, and then you got some upgrades people can do. So, it's interesting you're talking about this because I was just reading this, it's like, I like to read textbooks, even though I didn't go to college, this is how I do my version of college. So, I was reading this book on, it's just a psychologist, Dr. David Bus' psychology book. He's actually coming here tomorrow. It's one of the most interesting guys in the world. And he's talking about the rise of gang membership around the world. And he said, it completely tracked the breakdown of the old family unit tribe, right? You gang started to get big, let's say, I mean, there's always been some form of gang, but people wanna belong to something. And so now if you could build a business, you see that with Lady Gaga. She called her fans, like the little, wasn't it little monsters or something like that? And Justin Bieber, what do they call, Beliebers. So, one of our top successors, I talk about in the book a lot, it's a fitness there, she's in the weight loss space. And her last name, her maiden name was Tool. So, she always was like, was tool time trainer. And it was tough because people didn't like self-identify with that. Right. And so, she heard this the first time, she went to the event we did, and on the flight home, she's like, I need to change this to something that like, that my people will associate with. And it was tougher because her business at that point had been her name. And she's like, that's not big enough for everybody else. And so, on the flight home, she's like, she was thinking about ideas, and also she had this idea, she's like, I'm gonna rebrand it as Lady Boss Weight Loss. And my women are gonna be Lady Bosses. They went home, they completely, like the leader of their whole business, which was doing well, rebranded it, launched this thing called Lady Bosses. And if you look at her movement right now, they have over 100,000 women who have purchased their programs, who are in this thing, and every single week they do these swag drops. They come in and she's like, I got my Lady Boss swag, and she'll come in and she'll reveal it, and they'll have it in a set for a short period of time, and I'm not allowed to share their numbers, but they will sell so much clothing in a finite period of time to all the Lady Bosses, because they have these shirts, I'm a Lady Boss, and they have all these quotes that people self-identify with. And when they took it from a brand, like their name, to this thing that's bigger, like people can identify with it. I just wanna reiterate, I've seen this over and over. Even what I do, people, I have Knowledge Society as one of the names of one of my companies. And it's not even something I tried to brand, and I see my employees latching onto that because you can't latch onto being Tylopiz, that's just one person. But being attached to Knowledge Society is this higher purpose. And if you look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs, there's five levels of needs. Physiological is at the base foundation, and you have number two, you have safety. And then number three, you have love. And number four, you have status and respect. But number five is self-actualization, or actualization to a higher purpose. And that's where people find God, and they find, you know, they find, like Mohawk McGonvey and his movement to kind of gain independence for his country. Martin Luther King, Jr., Abraham Lincoln. And so what you're doing is you're applying those same principles to a brand. And you've took you from zero to $100 million a year. Think about the big brands. The ones that have done a really good job in the last generation have done that. You look at Apple, like people. Biggest company in the world, Apple. People self-identify with that. Oh yeah. Like there's Apple users and there's everybody else. Like there's that thing, you look at shoes, you look at clothing line, you look at, like the best brands have done that. For some reason, most businesses, like we don't think about that, it's like, oh, well I sell this, or I'm a financial planner, I'm in real estate, or whatever, it's like, those who start, looking at the pattern, I'm a big pattern guy. Like you see a pattern, it's like, okay, now I know the pattern, how can I amplify that? So we realize this is the pattern. And the book goes through like how to create those movements. But you understand the pattern, it's like, okay, how can I do this in my business? And when I became aware of it, then it's like, okay, now I know what it is, I can amplify this. And I know these are the pieces of how to make this movement happen. And like, what are all the elements of a good movement? And how to be the leader of that movement? One of the things, when you understand it, you can amplify it. And most people never know, they're just, oh, I sell this thing, this is my business. And they tell us a little more, like what's the, what did you build, was it just this hack funnel kind of idea or funnel hacks? Or like what's kind of, what have you identified with? You know, I think the majority of our members, they're small entrepreneurs, they're people who, they're still involved in like their business, they're the marketing of the business, and they're passionate about their idea. I was our customers like five or six years ago, right? I had ideas, I had things I wanted to get out, but I didn't, I don't know how to do that. I don't know how, I'm not a website designer or developer or anything. And so I had to like hire people, and they're just so slow and just frustrating. So for me, it was like, when we had click funnels, I was able to like, as a, as a, someone who's passionate about my product or my service, I could just go and put it out there really really fast. And I was talking to your partner earlier about MentorBox, and he was like, back in the days, like I had a hundred developers here to build all of our software and our things. He's like, I guess I'm gonna work for a company now. Two, and they logged in to click funnels and they edit stuff. Like that's all we do. So it gives people like us who are passionate about a product or an idea or whatever, it gives us, I always hope people, it makes entrepreneurs free to like share their message and not get logged down to all the tech stuff that keeps people from doing it. And so our people are funnel hackers. Like that's their thing. It's like, I don't get stuck down all the tech. I can just go share my message. I can sell products. I can do whatever it doesn't want to do. So people have an idea, you're no longer constrained by technology. Thanks so much for watching part one. I hope you enjoyed the interview so far.
