Okay, let's do this one more time. 10X growth con. It's quickly becoming one of the biggest marketing conventions in the world. Some call it transformational, some call it a pitch fest, some say it's life changing. The one thing you can't argue with is that it's growing. First was your ride of 2018. They said, hey Russell, we're going to do an event next year where we're trying to get 9,000 people in the arena. Do you want to come? And I was like, I don't think that's possible. But somehow they pulled it off and every seat was filled. Every stop was pulled, lights, sound, rooftop entrances, parties, and an engaged audience. So my team matched the effort. We spent weeks coordinating new speech, new slides, stories, videos, and a few theatrics. The result was one of the worst standing ovations of all time because no one was there. The table rush was massive. Photoshoots were endless and within a few hours we ran out of order forms. The next day we went up again for a repitch. The result was a $3.2 million presentation in 90 minutes. Which got us some attention. But what followed was thousands of people asking how we did it, how is that even possible? So we launched a course teaching people the art of sewing from stage. Eight days open and the course hit the two comma club. So naturally Grant called us back for round three. Now I thought it was crazy before, but this time I knew it. He said we're going to have 35,000 people, more people than the city that I live in. He'd read the Marlin Stadium in Miami and put on a show so ambitious, so over the top, it'll go down in history. You have no idea of the size of this place here. There's 3,000 seats between second base and home base. There will be more people on this first section of seats than were in the entire Mandalay Bay. And the goal became to hit $10 million in sales. No pressure, right? Hello everyone. So excited to have you all here with us. We're going to talk about 10X today. This event is the biggest event we've ever been a part of. There's 35,000 people coming to this event in Miami. So comfortable shoes will be on our feet a lot. We'll be running around a lot. We have a lot of stuff to do. 3,000 FBS buyer packets and 2010 X secret ones to the hotel. We will have temporary employees handing out order forms as people run up to the sales tables. Let's move on to the scorecard. Our critical number for today is 74,021 active users. Hi. Yeah, so great. That's 18 months record breaking type of stuff. So crazy, crazy stuff happening. All we're focused on right now is 10X and making sure that everything goes as it's supposed to go. So 10X, 10X, we're going to crush it this weekend. Let's get out there and make it happen. It's all starting. It's starting. I fell asleep five last night, but then I forgot this morning we had dentist appointments for the kids. So I'm laying there at 6.30, she messed up through the first alarm. She shakes me. She's like, what's the deal? I'm like, what? She's like, go ahead and go to 10X. I'm like, what? That's today. I'm like, oh my gosh. I was sitting up like, 10X. We were packing, we were like, no, no, the dentist. I'm like, oh my God. Anyway, so thank heavens it wasn't 10X, it was the dentist. So I thought I lost a whole day, so I'm so grateful that I have today to finish all this stuff. Very grateful. I'm plugging in hopefully the most embarrassing video of all time. My very first stage presentation ever. I'll try to show how bad I am on stage. It's kind of a broad overview, hopefully to help you to better, to give better information of the whole internet marketing business. This little nerd right here is going to be doing this on stage in two days. They're giving me 20 extra minutes for my second pitch. Dude, Fred in Miami, so excited for you. It's not going to lie, it's pretty cool to be friends with the high-space speaker of all time. Just crushing, man. Just by lack of sleep and everything else, we've got the first presentation, almost completely nothing I need to export it from Google Slides into PowerPoint and hope that all the fonts don't get jacked up. We're about to export from Google Slides to PowerPoint and pray that all the fonts don't get destroyed and ruined. Of course you're good. Everyone go home, we're done. Everything's over. Oh, it's so stressed out right now. Downloads awesome. What if it's more options? Yes. You're saying there's a chance. What's next? Yeah, I hope it's going to work. Me too. What are you guys looking at? What are you doing here? I'm going to try and do the thingy. If we do the thing, then it might work. Hopefully we did this right. All images are blurry. What? Why is that blurry? Other than some images being jacked, fonts look amazing. The good thing is this is only in front of 35,000 people. Six-story monitors are all see every pixelated image. What is that? I don't know. It's been the vibe of the office in the last couple of days leading up to 10X. Possible. Like yesterday, there was a ton of, I don't know if this is going to work. Today everyone's like, man, we got this. We totally own this thing. This is ours. This office is like the most amazing. Everyone's all hands on deck to make sure whatever has to happen, happens. I think there's some real uneasiness in the office right now for 10X. A lot of the big decisions and stuff have already been made. They're done. We can't change. It's just too late. We can't print more things like it's done. I think with half the team already on the way to Miami, it's just kind of surreal. It feels weird. Todd, tell me where we're going. We're going to the 10X event. We're driving right out of the airport. We're flying to Miami and watching Russell speak in front of 35,000 people. Are you ready? Yeah. Let's do it. Let's do it. All right. So just landing in Miami, the team is just about to arrive. These are the guys who are going to be setting up everything early. We have a bunch of supplies, bunch of t-shirts, bunch of stuff. All of us are sweaty and soupy might be a good word to say, but we have someone that thinks we're a band here. Oh, sweet. What kind of band? Rock band. Yeah, that's what band is. Yeah, this is punk rock. You thought he was the guitarist? We're the guitarists. The bass is always heavier, just kind of like nush or jing. I think the plan, as we know, we'll go to the hotel like eight in the morning. We'll head straight over to the stadium and then we can get the order forms out to every single lemonade stand. You know, I haven't seen Russell very often, but you know what's funny is that I've got access to our security system. I've got the eye in the sky, if you will, and I have seen Russell here at night. So he's like coming in after hours where he can't get distracted and he's getting his stuff done. Now, the countdown is, it's literally like we're hours away from taking off. Yeah, I have a lot of concerns. First off, like, I have new shoes that are really slippery. Like, what if I slip? Plus, like, we launched the Tenant Secrets course early this year. We're kind of like Babe Ruth and Caller Shot, you know? It's like, hey, 3.2 million last year. Look how great we are, the best public speaker in the world. If I don't do good, everyone's going to, like, they will mock me publicly online. It'll be hugely embarrassing because not only will 35,000 people see it live, then it'll go to the interwebs. And once it's the internet, everybody will be like, oh, Russell sucks. He's not as good as he said he was. Like, that's nerve-wracking. Then this time, like, the first 10X event, it was just me and Dave. Dave showed up with a box of order forms and pens. They didn't give us a sales table. We had almost a million. Year two, we, like, coordinated this whole thing. We only had probably a dozen people from our team. And this year, I think we're flying out, like, 50 or 60 people, plus, like, 100 plus 10. 150 people that just, like, process orders, which, like, if I don't get very many orders, it's going to be really embarrassing. And a huge waste of money, like, probably $100,000 plus dollars worth of waste of money. So there's a lot more in the line this time than the first time we walked in there with a box of order forms and pens. How many order forms do we have this year, Jess? I think we have, like, 15,000. 30,000 order forms. So hopefully we sell every single person in the stadium. We don't. 15,000, yeah. That's what I do. We're really going big this year. You're a 6% sale. Not from Miami. Start backing up slowly. Dude, this is great, guys. I just went down the wrong way. 10x essential supplies, what do we need? Trying to save a life with some fresh breath. What else do we got? Energy drinks? Lots of energy drinks. I think they're coming. I think we got a palette of... You need copious amounts of caffeine. You need gum so your breath doesn't stink and you'll hurt people's faces. You have terrible records. Should we place bets? How much Russell sells? Yeah, let's do it. 14 million. 8.1. 16. I'm going to guess just 11. He's going to do 18.9. The numbers are 15, so that's the bets we're taking over under. But if this isn't an eight-figure event for Russell, something's gone horribly wrong. I reckon it could be 14, though. So I reckon, yeah, maybe like 15, 16. 15, 16. I'm sticking with 14 because I reckon he'll do that easy. So I don't actually see myself speaking again outside of my own events, like Funnel Hacking Live. I can't even imagine myself doing another event like this. This may be the last giraffe in that standpoint. I've been kind of the all-star, being out there doing all the things, getting in the limelight, but to go from zero to 100 million, I needed to be the all-star. But to go from 100 million to a billion, I can't get 10 times better, you know what I mean? Like, that's probably not going to happen. For us to get to a billion, it has to be the I-stop being the all-star and become the coach. So to do that, like, we have an entire speaker team we're flying out. We've been training a team of 20 on my pitch, on my presentation, and they're coming here to learn it, to watch and to master it. For the next year, we're sending them out on the road to do this presentation. So in the future, it's not going to be me doing a bigger stage. It's going to be 20 of me doing 1,000 person stages all around the country every single week of the year. So I kind of look at this as my final run, and then my retirement is shifting from all-star to coach. Oh! I'm going to see it. Russell wants to see this. I don't know if I should let you watch this or not. Just to say it even more, it will probably. What is that take to do? Seriously. Why is it called freeing? This is happening right now. Yeah. This was yesterday. This is freaking insane. That's crazy. In an audience that large from a strategy perspective, if you have a smaller audience, a lot of times you're conversing and be a lot higher, right? There's more, obviously there's more reports. So what are you doing? Are you doing anything to bridge the gap? Or are you doing anything that you think can up the ratio at that level of people? Hopefully. I don't think it's going to be easier to sell this stadium because the one in Vegas was tough because it's like it's Manila Bay. If you're in this section, you go to section 138 up there. And over here, it's like so confusing to try to get people to run to move and everything. This is like, can you see the 17 tables go and get everyone moving? And anyway, we'll see. It'll be fun. Is it 30 minutes or 45 minutes? Is it the airport? Yeah. 30 minutes. The plane leaves when you get there. The good news is it's not going to leave without you. Yeah. Yeah. Exercise and being in here. Okay. All right. I'm sorry. Face it. What's up, everybody? All right. So we are about to jump on. So this is Brian Underwood. So Brian decided that he wanted to come hang out with us and go to 10X. So he flew his private plane here and literally just picked us up. Like, who does that? What are you guys looking at? Order of farms. Well, now remember, I went to a couple of like these, like, were they all or trying to sell from stage? Most of them still don't do it, right? This will happen. So, okay. So rewind. Like when I got started this game 15 years ago, like it was, it was a science, right? Like people were awesome at it. And then the recession hit events guide for like four years. And then all the people who were doing like motion retired, John Childers, a couple of guys who were teaching public training, they all retired and ended. And then we were like, what's the next thing? And then I got retired, John Childers, a couple of guys who were teaching public training, they all retired and ended. Recession happened. I kept doing it through webinars for four or five years and then events came back and literally it's like, it's just a dead art that no one knows. I've been trying to re-teach it to people and people are learning, but it's just like, it's, I'm not special. I just learned it from the old dudes and the old ones still doing it. So it's like, it's really fun. I'm trying to get a adjudicator here for a world record tomorrow. Last minute. Yeah. Most order forms collected in 24 hours. No. I'm trying to get a Guinness world record for you basically most order forms collected within a 24 hour period of time. Guinness book of world record? So you didn't know you were sitting in the presence of Guinness book of world record bubble soccer players, did you? Now he knows. We just landed in Miami. Russell is working on his slides because we're afraid that he doesn't have time to get them finished up by 6.45 his soundcheck tonight. So we're going to head over to Neiman Marcus because we need to get him a shirt. I can have it ready for him by tomorrow morning. Is there an arm and so let's start shirts with Taylor wise. We can do this one as a backup. They don't have any other buttons. I don't know if the camera will like that or not. So that's pretty right there. Then I've got some other stuff. But each time we have a t-shirt. Russell's head right now. Well, I heard that he's got to go shopping. And I think he's trying to distract himself from being so worried about 10 X and yeah. We just got through the speaker entrance and we are walking around about to walk in. It's amazing. It's not even real. It seems fake. It's like we're at a Metallica concert or something. You know what I mean? So crazy. It's amazing. It's insane. Dude, this is loud. Like it's loud. You can't talk to the person next to you. I'm right. When the music is playing. So great. And I think that there's a bit of a bounce on the sound. So I think that once we get people in the seats, that'll go away because it won't be, it'll be bouncing off for people and it won't be bouncing back. Yeah. Crazy. You're amazing. This is brilliant man. I'm his follow up. I warmed him up. I'm the court nester. No you're not. So Grant, what's your response to people who say. First of all, Russell Brunson says he's the greatest salesman in the world. Let me just say this because I've been wanting to know. I didn't say it. I just heard it a lot. Russell needs to remember the biggest sale he ever made. First of my audience. That's all. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it. But Russell needs to remember the biggest sale he ever made. First of my audience. That's all. All you did, all you did dude was feed him dinner. I got him to my house. It was a big house. Look at this thing. It's insane. Check, check, check, check. Russell Brunson to the stage. There goes your weapon. What's crazy is like I started this journey 14 years ago when the internet was just getting started. Pre Facebook, pre MySpace, back when Google was getting started. And we were learning all these techniques about marketing and driving traffic and funnels. But a lot of people thought it was dishonest or scammy or weird. Most of the world just brushed it off. Like the big brands could be on the internet, but there's no room for the little guys like us. And it's just fascinating how 14 years later this little thing that I've been so passionate about and talking about every single day now is the chance to go mainstream. I wore a baseball stage for crying out loud talking about funnels. And sure, it's me. Tomorrow I get to walk out on stage. But really, I feel like it's a reflection of our entire community. A whole bunch of entrepreneurship people didn't believe in. People thought they were lazy or they weren't smart or they struggled in school or whatever it was. They were just different. They were excited. They were trying to create things. And they've been pushed down for so long and finally we're getting this chance for all of us collectively to go into the mainstream. Like what we're doing may no longer be seen as weird. So in 90 minutes, if I can prove that on behalf of our community, I feel like I've done my job. All right. The Echo. And then just to direct that something, they have a different song note and they're going to get on the... It's not going to be this bad, but it's going to have an Echo style. Like when I go to a baseball stadium, it's now batting, batting, batting. Darrell, Kyle, Kyle. Number one. Number two. Number three. Number four. Number five. Number six. Number seven. Number eight. Number nine. Number nine. Number nine. Number nine. Number nine. Number nine. Number nine. Number nine would number CDDRCZ. Number eight. Number nine. Number eight. Number nine. Number seven. Number five. Number nine. Number seven. Number nine. Number nine. Number number five. Number nine. Number seven, number nine. Number nine. Number nine, number, nine. Number of power. What. Number nine. Number nine. 100. 100 tens of millions of. Critics of power. 100. Oh my gosh. I couldn't get back to sleep. Seriously, I finally took a snapshot of like 440. It's 447 in the morning. I've been laying here for 45 minutes. I'm so worried. I'm just going to go. I need to go. So we're going to go. All right, we're heading out the door. This is the click funnel staff is going to be taking orders. If I don't screw up today, don't screw up today, Russell. What's the sound of one-hand clapping? Right there. Thanks, bye. So Blake, how are you feeling about the experience right now? I feel great. I got all my slides done. I just don't want to fall. Let's see how many people. There's a lot of people who would be like, hi. And they will. Have a back to you. We need to get more filmmakers on video. It's fun. All right, it is 7 AM. It's a big day. It's a big day for everybody. Lots of build-up to this. It seems like since last time we were at this event, as soon as Russell Crust did on stage last year, within moments of him stepping out of stage, Grant's like, you're coming back next year. And so from that moment, we're like, OK, this year, it's just going to be bigger. We're trying to do three times that. And then the other thing is when Grant plans the whole thing, they were like, we're going to stay in 35,000. I'm like, what? And they're like, can you do 10 million? I'm like, yes. But you always say yes. If I screw up, anyway, it's not good. I think they said over $10 million just in cost to run the event so far. Oh, so he's the happy man. What's his last business name? Bronson. Bronson. How do you spell it? B-R-U-N, best go-ins. R-U-N. Best go-ins. Bronson? Yep. What's the first? Russell. Russell? Yeah, all right. We're going to be in some. Oh, my gosh. Here. Heat it up. Oh, yeah. I have a more ketones in my body than any human. Should ever have it. You didn't give me 10. I'm feeling good. Freaking out. Are you ready? No, I'm not ready. I guess I am ready. I guess I'm ready, technically. We're a software company. This is crazy. Do we sell software? Do we sell software? We sell software. We sell software. We sell software. You've been in there? I haven't in a while. I feel the energy like building out. Seriously, can't. He's waiting for the rest of the. We allowed in? Yes. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I need my own security guard in real life. That'd be so cool. Holy cow. I just like so many nerves. It's insane. Like, I just wanted to go away. I bet you do, honestly. I was going through slides. You taste it. The first intro's new. And I'm like, this is like a past the intro. This is like everything I know. You know what I mean? Are you feeling, are you getting nervous? Or are you just excited? No, I just want to shake my hands. Be security guys. I'm afraid that they'll crush me. People are starting to file in. It's just crazy. I don't know how they're going to get 35,000 people in the next hour. But I'm just so grateful that that's an our logistical nightmare to figure out that somebody else's. We just have to show up and do our thing, which is really nice. Yeah. Grant just jumped out of the plane. We're going to bring catch him inside the stadium coming in. I mean, there are a lot of infestates. I bet there's stress now right now. I was granted. I'm so stressed out right now. How many are you in right now? You think? How many people are in right now? I'd say about 10,000. My name is Philip Robinson. I'm in a duty cater with Guinness World Records. We are here at Marlins Park. We're here to measure Guinness World Records attempt at the most paper order forms collected in 24 hours. Now Russell Bronson and the team have got 40 people here distributing these order forms for software that's really going to change people's businesses. So the excitement and the appetite is here to buy the forms. We just got to verify to make sure that at least 2,000 have these forms processed later on this afternoon. And then we will have a new Guinness World Records title. So we shall see. I know. I know. I still. Yeah. You can ask more people to get in. You can see you're kind of going down. Is it better with the roof on me? One was my brother. One was my brother. And one was my brother. I see Grant's head right now. Every nice person is a guy. Two lovely girls. A one in one. I compare out the way. Time to go. Grant's almost finished and they gave me the call. Tapped me on the shoulder and said let's go. So kind of freaking out but walking down the hallway now. And then we'll get mic'd up. And then the whole party begins. Our next presenter is a company over a million hundred thousand copies of the book. And he popularized the concept of sales funds. Which led him to co-founding a software company called ClickMarkers. And he just crossed a hundred million dollars and saved it to be number 73,000 hundred thousand dollars in an accurate amount. He has became a model. He is the key internet's favorite entrepreneur. Ladies and gentlemen, stand on your feet. Bring to the stage with a thunderous 10X applause Mr. Russell Ransom! Ransom! Ransom! Ransom! Ransom! You know the hardest thing about being an introvert? Is it sometimes when I get nervous? I tend to talk pretty fast. Something like this. Specialists are there. Well, my top of the class is going to be a couple of years, but I don't really know. We need to finish the challenge. We're still going to see what we can do to try and get to our record grade in 2000, workforce. I don't know what we're going to do yet, but we're in the process of looking to get into some boots and getting us back on stage and doing some other things to make that happen. Regardless, it's been a massive successful event and it wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for all of you, your positive attitudes, your willingness to work around the clock. And I just want to thank you again once one more time. I think for right now, I'll probably dismiss you guys and let you guys go get some breaths, a shower, whatever you guys may want. And just pay attention to the Vox channel and we'll kind of figure things out as we go. Does that sound good? Awesome. Thank you again guys. Super good. I have no idea. I need some dirt plus to take a break. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, we're good. It's a game plan right now and I'm going to get off the end of the road. I'm going to get off of Jared and find out if he had the boots and had the boots there the whole weekend so we can just pick up ones of the orders. The logistics would be so hard. The logistics are so hard. We had this event. We had two boots that nobody knew existed. The boots didn't have to put on this branding on them. They're going to be as upset as we are because they were depending on you. See if we can get everyone to drop down from the third level down to the mezzanine. Yeah. The higher up you go, the worse you can hear. Yeah, for sure. All right. What are we going to do next? I think Dave's working on meta plans. There's always opportunity. There's lots of good stuff happening today. Lots of good stuff. Part of the thing is our expectations were so like, because we know what we did last year. But there's so much opportunity out there. I think we're going to reach out and see how we can help. Tonight right now until we figure out what we're doing tomorrow, I'm trying to get two boots. They're working on right now getting us tables. The idea was to have Phillip and Grant and Russell get on the stage before he spoke for the last pitch to award the Guinness World Record. Because that will set the stage for what we're selling tomorrow. But it'll work. It's just a matter of how we win. That's a wrap. All right. Due to fire marshal restrictions, we cannot add any more tables, which people can certainly go into the next offer tables in conjunction with ours. I don't know why it's an issue, except it was pretty crazy when they went for lunch. Cheers. I like the butter man. Thanks bar bar yesterday. I know. I thought it really went well with the jacket. It was like a towel. I'm ready to retire. I'm always sleeping. I'm always ready to be good at the world. So like, you don't have to do anything. Just like, you know, whatever someone comes to meet you, they need to come back. We're on the reverberating microphone. I know right. It helps you so much. It's crazy. Dude, I was just like, when you got done and I'm just walking, I'm just, I sat in a section and grabbed nine towels. I'm like, you know, like towels. I'm like swinging. Swinging, which was kind of fun. Then I'm like looking at just the walk, just the chaos. So much chaos. How is it? And the other thing, like last 10 X was dark. It's like you get your rhythm because you don't see much. You know what I mean? You're so like, I can see everyone's face looking at him. It's like, oh my God. It's like, it was way different. Like, so weird. Anyway, You're amazing. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. You're so great. That way or that way? Yeah. All right. So, How can I help? Thank you. It's just a success for you guys. We can't bring sound up. But what we could do is figure out a way to tell them what they missed. That would push us back. Do we go back for the three or do we go start for the 25? I think we go for the 25. Yeah. I think we go for the 25 grant. Man, you got the bull. Okay, good. I'm with you, man. Let's roll. Heck yeah. We're ready for that. Okay. I'm there. You guys, anything I can do to help? You just let me know. Awesome. Thanks, man. We appreciate it. Okay, man. Anything I can do to help? I want to make sure we're both together. We will. We'll make the, We want to return the favor to you as well. Okay, yeah. All right, guys. Thanks. Take care, guys. That's what happened. That was Grant. He was nervous his day one cells were kind of like not as good as normal. And he was getting us out. We wanted to just sell the same thing again. But we said, nope, we're going for 25 K. He seemed relieved. Oh, he was totally relieved. Okay. There's no stupid dog joke. So I told you, I'm totally slaughtering these jokes. I'm not good at jokes. All right. So, uh, uh, crap. Why does stupid dog get nervous to go out when it's cloudy? No, that's not it. Something about the drizzle. Something to do with the drizzle and the drizzle. I don't know. I suck at this. We got a high light. And it's been a long day. And a very interesting day. But we're going to strategize and come up with something awesome tonight. Because the audio is so bad, you got to talk slower. Could you hear those speakers better as it went on? It was definitely better when they opened up the windows, cracked ones. And the mic helped a lot. And I think a lot of people who came up and then they opened the order form, like the graphics on the order form. They're like, so they said it was software. And then we opened up and they were like, but now I see there's all this stuff. And so then we started talking about all this stuff. And every single person that came to our table was just like, we could not hear anything. What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this? But there were some people who honestly, I was watching the crowd and I feel like the demo video, people started getting up to go back. Like that, like because they couldn't hear it, but they were watching like what was happening on the screen. And I think that was like, and Steven and I were together and we were like, oh, right, right. It's hard to take to be serious. I realized with this all right now. This is really important because it gets that off his mind and he's relaxed about it. So I think this is actually good for him right now because his thing to do. This is part of the process. Yes. It's totally part of the process. I got him right where I want him. We're going to get some. Arm parts. Arms are so long. I was just, it's forced confidence for the speech tomorrow. I just really wanted him to do that. Thank you for sacrificing your body. You're welcome. Thank you. Day three. Grandestine tackled the sound head on. Microphones were switched out. Sound blankets were hung around the rows. They opened up the roof of the stadium to let some of the echo out. Now, sound wasn't perfect, but it was drastically better. Today's going to be V-Day. We learned it. We came back, came back playing all night. Now we're here to the attack. We're going to change lives today. We're going to go downstairs, set up all the 10 X order forms. That's a rock and roll. We're back for day number two. Lunch has ended and I'm on in like two hours, I think. So right now we're watching Bethany Frank speak. Whoever will end up telling my wife that she looks like her. So this is called stunt double. It's kind of cool. Dave, rented, bought, bribed. One of the 10 X employees. And now we got a jersey. We were in a lot up on stage and we had a lot of people going up on stage. And this is art. This is our time. So I'm going on the cover. I'm going up. I'm going to get the shots. It's not going to smile. Try not to look lazy. Try to look like I blend in. You know, these people have seen me. Oh, the hat. Bang. Bang time. It is, I don't know, five, almost five? Or, yeah, it's five on the dots. So we're up in like 15, 20 minutes. So it's about to begin. Crazy. You're going to do amazing. Up, go, go, go. Woo! Woo! Woo! You're gonna dance. We are on stage. We are on stage. These are Breeze. I need you to talk a lot slower. So you say a sentence. And then you say something else again. When you get going and you're hyped up, you're word, word, word, word. And it just starts bouncing around really, really bad. So be very conscious of that. That would be awesome. Team, welcome to the most important meeting of our entire lives. Russell. Do you know why I'm here? I'm here because I believe in you. I'm here because of you. You're called to do what you do. I was not called to do what you do. Without you, I can't do what I was called to do. I'm here because I'm in your military force. I'm on your team. I'm in your unit. You're the general. Today I'll go to war with you. But for something that you have seen long before I could see it, it's not flowery speech for me to talk about how click funnels did something for me. Hey, what can I get from this? People follow you because of who you are and what comes through you. The software is the weapon. The frame is the game, but you're the reason. And I love the reluctant hero. I do. I love it. But there's a piece in you too that's ready to click. This is the piece that you've got in an army just waiting for that little click of fire and it's game over. There's no one that will stand on this stage that can harness the power that you have access to right now because you built an army and you weaponized them. And I know that all of us here are doing something bigger than we actually understand. And so out there was a circus yesterday and it happened on purpose and it set up what's about to happen. From the beginning when you walk on to the begin when Marlon and you finish it up, every single one of us have an important role to play, which is get into the state that's required that when you start speaking, the thing that comes through him comes through you. So that this is seen not as a Russell show. It is not even a ClickFunnel show. It is a movement of people being called to lead movements all centralized on one thing, which is waking people up. So I'm here because I follow you to support you and your calling. And I needed what you had to be able to take this that I feel and take it to literally hundreds of thousands and soon millions. Thank you. Individual, entrepreneur, business owner, engineer, policeman, fireman, nurse and teacher, you have something you need to get out to the world and you need a funnel that sits on the Internet and works for you automatically. I want to bring back to the stage a genius. Okay, my friend Russell Brunson. Russell come out here and tell them. I am so excited to be back with you guys tonight. How are you all feeling? When Grandi were on the plane a couple months ago building his funnel, he said, I would love to have you come speak at 10X growth con about two things. Number one, I want you to explain to everybody how funnels work. And he said some of the people have known the record you say. He said you did $3.2 million in sales in 90 minutes. How many of you guys were there for that experience? All right. He said, would you be willing to break down and show everybody in this room what you do and how you do it so they can sell like that from stage as well. Okay, so the title of my presentation is actually 10X secrets. And I'm going to show you guys every single person here how you can instantly 10X your sales and also your time off by mastering the lost art of platform selling and how to do that without actually becoming famous. What I learned in this journey was something very interesting. I learned that there's two ways to make money as a speaker. Number one is you become famous and you get paid to speak. The second way to make money is to speak for free and you get paid to sell your products and your services at the end of your presentation. Now, yesterday, despite the fact that nobody can hear me very well because of the echo, we still did well over a million dollars in sales. I want to understand that this is a lot easier than being famous. Okay, when you master this skill, it'll dramatically increase everything you do from this point forward. Every business we've tried this and we attempted it with this work. And I started sharing this process with people close to me, people I love, people who are creating products and businesses and movements and try to change the lives of their customers. In fact, I brought a few of them here today because I want you to meet them. So my name is Garrett J. White, founder of Wake Up Warrior, the number one training company in the world for married businessmen with children. We believe that we could empower people for the first time in the conversation of money. And we're in a mission to save marriages and to help people with good marriages divorce proof them. I thought this work for me for my soap business. I was broken at that time in my life and I knew I had to do something different. I had to make a change. And we were stuck in a world that was built for one-on-one sales. But we had zero marketing skills and couldn't really let anybody know about our solution and that it exists. Everybody, everybody in this room has been touched by the pain of addiction. Everybody knows somebody. And I had a master's in marketing that I paid $150,000 for. But I could not figure out how to get my message to the people who needed it the most. And in 2017, my husband and I scraped together the money we had and we went to Funnel Hacking Live and I met Russell Brunson. We have a joke inside Inner Circle. We say hashtag do what Russell says. And so that's what I did. I did what Russell said and it worked. I sell $37 e-books. I made $535,000 selling e-books. E-books! You look crazy! And guess what? In four months, I sold over a million dollars. We went from doing low, you know, $80,000 a year with farmers markets to doing $130,000 in our first six weeks and over $2 million in our first year. So rather than quitting, we made the decision to do everything that Russell says. In two years, we did a million in sales. And Russell doesn't even know this yet. We were adding up the numbers in our hotel room last night and since that launched less than a year ago, we just hit $10 million in sales. And on the very first webinar, 10% of the people there bought while we were still talking! On a room I filled with 1,200 people, $1.725 million in 90 minutes. In 2012, went from 100 men to 4,500 men. Clap it! If you have a message and you want to change the world and you live in a world built for one-on-one, his process is the only framework that will break that and allow you to do it. I know so many of you have started. You became an entrepreneur because you had dreams and goals and vision. And get it out there! Because if you don't, the difference you're meant to make in this world will die inside of you. Grant said it best. It doesn't matter if you have the cure for cancer or the cure for alcohol addiction, if you don't have the attention of the people who need the cure. So the question is not does a funnel work? Question is do you got fire? And do you have the courage with that fire to go after the thing that you desire? You can always make up and leverage what you lack and ability. The framework that Russell has created can help you 10x the speed at which you get paid. Now the woman that I am here right now today is not the woman that I was two years ago. Like funnels change my life. I know it can change yours. Thank you, Natalie. Thank you guys for coming. I don't care what business you're in, this process will work. It shifts everything from selling one-on-one to one-on-many. Again, you're getting access to everything talked about here. The live home study course. You're going to come to Boise. I don't work with me and my team to build out all your entire slide presentation. You're working to get your funnel built out so it's live. You can just start running it. We're working with Myron to get you to learn how to run many events as well. Then we're going to come back to Miami to hang out with Grant and his team to show us how to fill events on the phones. It's going to be amazing. Total value of $97,000. You guys get this offer. Just one payment, $25,000 today. Or just three payments of $10,000. Thank you guys so much for having us here. We appreciate you and we'll see you guys all tomorrow. The Grosse Vox is just a $25,000 package. It's like this is toward the audience of 30,000 people. That's unheard of. I thought he was going to counter offer double stack yesterday. But he came back with something completely different. What are you thinking of this? I got to see where it's going for a long time. If he doesn't call it at least $3,000,000 from that, I'd be surprised. I mean, just thank you guys. I know that everybody has put in so much for this weekend. I think we've put in more effort in this than our own events. I know how much time and energy and effort was put in prior to this whole experience. And then late nights, early mornings, insanity. And a lot of times I get all the credits and the dude on stage. But I am fully aware that without all of you guys supporting and serving, that what we do isn't possible. But I think that what we're doing every single day, it gives everybody in our community permission to kind of do the same thing. And I think that's the biggest reason. I feel like that's one of the biggest parts of our calling. It's like we have to be doing these things and pushing the boundaries and showing people what's possible. Because then they believe it's possible. You know, we had a really cool opportunity to show 35,000 people over this weekend what we do and why we do it. And it's just special. And I'm just grateful to share that with all of you guys. It's just so grateful for our team. It's insane. It's funny when I first started this whole journey. As amazing as that vision was, what the reality is today is that Millie and Tine's better than I ever dreamed of. You know, my biggest concern about all this was not hitting our goals and then the team wouldn't have a story. That they'd fill that down. What I completely underestimated was that their entrepreneurs, their funnel hackers, and they don't dwell on challenges or adversity. They celebrate them. We love the uphill battles, the problem solving, and the surprises. Because we get to face them together. And 10X growth con, as challenging as it was, it was still the most epic and ambitious event that I've ever seen. So many things were outside of their control. And even with all their challenges, Grant and the team were still able to impact countless people's lives. I really don't know how they do it. And as far as my retirement from speaking, well, I'm not sure. The wrestler is supposed to leave his shoes on the mat after his last match. But I really like these shoes. I do know one thing though. As much as I love speaking, I love these people even more. So we'll just see what they have to say. Thank you.
