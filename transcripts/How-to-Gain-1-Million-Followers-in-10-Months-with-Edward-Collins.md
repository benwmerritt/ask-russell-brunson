## Transcript
One of the things you have to also understand about me is my very first social media post was in October of 2021. Today we're going to be talking about Instagram, the gram, whatever you want to call it, how do we grow a following very, very quickly. In the Traffic Seekers book, I talked a lot about how if you publish every single day for an entire year, you'll never have money problems again. Every single day we posted across all of our different social media platforms daily. And for a year and four months, we got crickets, like no traction at all. And so our guest today was ready to give up and then decided to make one little shift, one little tweak to how they're actually posting. And we started to look back at some of our consistent posts that had gotten some traction. And the very first video they posted this direction got them more than double their follower count and then went on to build a following of millions of people in the last like 10 months. This is like cutting edge brand new cool stuff. When we post, we typically get somewhere between 40 to 60,000 views at the same day. So if you're interested in growing your following, tune in for today's episodes. We love fun. And with that said, let's jump right into the interview. Our guest today is Edward Collins. And thank you so much for hanging out with me today, man. It's definitely my pleasure. So I'm curious first, because again, you're not like the traditional like internet marketing person. Like your background, what is your background prior to jumping into this? Well, I own a variety of different companies. So I got my start as an adult owning my own first business back in 1998. I launched a financial planning firm, a small little practice. But that was really my escape from what I was doing at the time because I was on the dark side. For anyone who's following my content, they know what I'm talking about. I worked for the government. So I had this dream when I was a teenager that I wanted to be an FBI agent. So I eventually got started working for the United States Department of Justice, but I saw behind the curtain and learned I really don't like the government. A lot of the challenges there. So when I decided to make my break, I went to the thing that I always had an interest in was money, like the concept of money and how it works. So I launched my financial planning practice in 1998. So I predate Google, predate YouTube. You're a graduate high school. So there you go. Yeah, exactly. But you grew up with technology. I did not. So my when I built out was all built by like literal handshakes. Like I actually had to meet people in person face to face, face to face, the worst, like build out those networks. I know, like, and it's, yeah, it was an interesting journey. Like I had a lot of challenges in the beginning of my career. But eventually I got to a point where I started having traditional milestones of success, then started building other businesses that were complimentary to it. Because I saw a need in the space that I was serving. So started off beyond my financial planning practice, I started a fractional CFO company, a tax practice, accounting firm, eventually got into real estate, residential commercial real estate, that's part of our portfolio now, still own all the companies. But my latest push is my coaching business, where I'm actually trying to coach business owners on how to, quite frankly, outsmart the IRS, keep more of their own money and then use their money to put it to work to create real wealth. Yeah, very cool. So when was the transition from like, I'm going to be shaking hands to build the companies and things like that too. I'm going to become a huge success celebrity on Instagram. Well, that definitely transition to that. It definitely wasn't like mindful in that regard. Yeah, for sure. I just I'd recognize that one, I sort of retired almost completely back in 2014, because all my companies were running, I had all the all the infrastructure in place. And I was essentially like the advisor. And I got to a point where there's only so many beaches that my wife and I can go to and visit. We've seen them all. Yeah, exactly. We've definitely traveled the world. And it's amazing. But one of the things that a lot of people don't talk about in this concept of retirement, because of Instagram age, now everyone's looking for it, it can give it really, really boring. Like, it really so my wife essentially encouraged me to get out of the house, go back and do something to work. Exactly. Actually, someone said something pretty interesting to me recently, he had a phrase and it's like, when you you're married, it's your wife's going to look at you sometimes. And she may say something like, for better or for worse, but not for lunch, go to work, right, get out of the house. And that's essentially what I did. I started going back into my companies and started getting more active and figure out what we could do to take it to the next level. And then COVID, right. And then that was like, oh, my goodness. What do we do now? Because again, all of our companies were brick and mortar oriented, very, very old school. And I had to figure out technology because we couldn't meet with people like it face to face. So I started learning about things like Zoom and go to meetings and all that sort of stuff. And I started seeing a lot of your content at the time. I'm like, Oh, there's this interesting thing called a funnel. What is that? And I'm like, okay, let me dive a little bit deeper. I eventually got hooked into a webinar that you were hosting. I think it was in either January or February of 2021. And then it sold me on to Common Club Live, which was your event. I think it was in June of that same year. Dove in, I was like, I'm hooked. This, this makes a lot of sense. I actually was in one of my companies in one of the boardrooms. I had, I was streaming go, go to to Common Club Live to that boardroom. And I literally had like a whiteboard and I was a everything that was being taught. I'm like, well, wait a minute, if I could do that, okay, there. And then I was sort of like, like really just bubble charting everything out. And by the end of the event, I'm like, well, wait a minute, scratch that I can create a whole new company that is like the coaching arm of the business. And then we have all of these other brick and mortar done for you services that could be complimentary to it. And that's when we launched up level entrepreneur. Very cool. It's interesting the transition. I see that, especially in the Dan Kennedy world, my body's company, like most entrepreneurs come to him and they learn how to grow their business. That's like phase number one, the phase number two is like, then they start coaching people who are like them, right? So they become the gurus of the dental industry and then the chiropractor industry, but it all starts like, using principles themselves and then using it to train others. It's interesting that you probably didn't even use them for yourself initially. You figure out how to work. And then the transition like, oh, we should like go deep on the coaching side. I think it's, it's everyone is best positioned to coach the younger version of them, right? So I can help people who have been through the journey that I went through because I literally went through it. And I, at least for myself, I knew the steps that you could take in order to get to the other side, sort of giving an opportunity for people to shortcut through the journey, get the similar outcome without similar scars, right? You and I have both been through some interesting scar experiences during the development of our careers. So it's funny people tell me all the time, like, I'm starting a business, but I don't know who, who my dream client is. And I was like, figure your dream client is. And I'm one time I was like frustrated with someone telling me that I'm like, your dream client is literally you five years ago. And then like the light bulb went off and I was like, Oh, that's it. Like that's who I was. That's who you are. Like most of the people, it's like you five years ago, what was the path? What's the result you figured out? And you're going back in time to, to the young version of you. And you look at it that way, it changes everything. So you're like, Oh, this would have like resonated. Like this is the thing that I told the story before, but like when I was in elementary school, I was getting into, I was buying junk mail for like how to get rich, quick schemes and stuff. And my name back there, my nickname was Rusty and so my parents called me Rusty. And some member when I was first writing copy for my very first, like how to start a business offer, I always think back like 12 year old Rusty, because I would get all this junk mail sent to me and my mom, I come from junior high and she had me my stack of junk mail, I go in my room and I read every single one. And I remember I get like 10, 20, 30 letters a day sometimes cause like calling all these places. And it was fun because I would like, I read the sales letter and some of them like, this is dumb. This is dumb. The ones I was like, I need it. I put it, I had two different piles and the pile is these are the ones that I believe in enough. I'm going to go beg my parents to buy them for me. And they never did, but I always do that. And so I was thinking like, what would 12 year old Rusty like, would he have, would he've gotten excited by this and it shifts how you create anything? Cause you're like, Oh, this would be anyway. So, okay. So I want to ask you a question. And so you started, you started doing this stuff and I'm specifically interested on the Instagram thing because it's such a fascinating story. Cause I know that when you, when you started there, you spent a lot of time posting and nothing happened, which happens to a lot of people. I'm doing the thing. I'm posting every single day. Why does something happen? I love to hear that part of the journey. Well, I think one of the things you have to also understand about me is I didn't grow up with this stuff, right? My very first social media post was in October of 2021. After, after funnel hacking live. And it was because you said we had to post. I'm like, okay, I'll post. And then that was very inconsistent. So from October through the end of the year, it was like not happening, but then you made another comment that you have to make a commitment, do it every day. So I sort of held myself accountable by announcing it to my team that I was going to post every day starting January 1st of 2022. And that's what I literally did. Every single day we posted across all of our different social media platforms daily. And for a year and four months, we got like crickets, like no traction at all. But that's the same that you stuck with it. Most people quit out like two days. My issues, I'm very, very stubborn. It's going to work. It's going to work. It's going to work. And I, again, since I didn't grow up with it, I didn't really understand how to do it. So I was constantly like asking different people, what should I be doing? And I was changing it all the time. So it was a very inconsistent look and feel. I did talking heads. I did carousel posts. I did picture posts and quote cards. Like I did like all the, all the different things that everyone was telling me to do. And we got to a point where in April, 2023, so a year and four months in, I walked into the studio and across all of our socials, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, like everything, we had less than 6,000 followers. That's with posting every day. And I walked in and I basically said to my team, I'm done. And they were like, no, you're not. And I'm like, no, you don't understand. I'm, I'm done. And they're like, no, especially like my director of implementation, Jose, is like, you made a commitment. And I'm like, ah, man, you, because what, what a good person, by the way, to do that. Most, most teams are like, okay, like, you know, probably on them, it's like, cool, it's a lot of work for us to instead that I held you to the help me accountable. Because again, I'm, I'm very stubborn. So if I say I'm going to do it, like if I, if I say I'm going to be there and I break my leg, I'm just going to get there. Like it doesn't matter. Like I'm going to do that. So I said, okay, if I'm going to do this, I can't keep doing what we're doing. Cause what we're doing is not clearly working. Like it just doesn't work. So let's look back. And we started to look back at some of our posts that had gotten some traction. And we noticed that there were these consistent posts that were getting traction. And for us, again, you have to understand the timeframe, traction for us, the most views was like 100, 150, 200 views in total. Like that was a lot for us back then. Again, we had like 6,000 followers less than in total. And there were these reaction videos. And the way I was doing them was I was doing a lot of research into like what videos I thought could make a lot of sense and we're aligned with my, my thought process and the way I talk and the, the, the subject matter. And then I would like choreograph it and script it out and like fine tune it and do like 18 million edits to it. And then I would film it and it would take me like four hours to do one video. And I said, we're not going to do that. Just pick one of the videos, put it on the phone, hit record on the, on the camera. I'll hit play and you'll record me watching it for the first time. And my face did weird things because it was the first time I saw something and I was like, well, that's not true. Cause my subject matter is I'm a lawyer, I specialize in tax, estate and business law. So, and obviously pretty heavy into the financial arena. So when I hear a lot of the stuff online that is not true, I get a little frustrated, right? And so my face started doing some weird things and I literally just put the phone down and I just spoke no script. And that was about three minutes of videoing and the editing that the team did is they just took out the ums and the odds, chopped it up and just posted it. And I went home, came in the next day and the team was like bustling. I'm like, what's going on? And they go, you don't know. I'm like, know what? Cause I don't like, again, I'm not the social guy. You're not on sick time every day looking at stuff. Yeah, I'm not. I'm definitely not scrolling. Um, and they're like, we got 8,000 followers last night. He doesn't followers, not views followers. Followers. Wow. And I'm like, what? I'm like, we more than doubled our follower account in a day and like, what happened? And I'm looking, I'm like, Oh, we're, we're going to do this. And that's what we did. We went. Do you remember the views that first one got? Oh my good. By now. You get 8,000 followers from a post. That's a lot of views. A lot of views. Like, and then we, we, we just went all in. And what a lot of people don't realize is that like, we don't even source the videos. Like the community sends my team videos. Like, we don't do any research. We're not opinion on all the videos. None at all. And then the team just picks the one that we're smitted the most and they don't even like go through it. Like they put it on the phone, they hit record. I watch, I hit play. I watch it for the first time being recorded. I literally put the phone down. I just talk. There's no scripting. It's just based again. I have a non-fair advantage. I've been doing what I do for 26 years. So I can just talk about this stuff, just like you could talk about marketing, right? You're able to teach people pretty much on any subject related to getting traffic and understanding how to build an online community and all of those aspects of things. And I could do that in the area of finance and, and legal structure and things of that nature for entrepreneurs here in the US. So the videos that people are sending you, are these videos from like other, other people or the news or all sorts of stuff? All different things. So mostly online gurus in the financial space of some sort. These who your friends are, they all hate you. Actually, it's remarkable. The vast majority of people are really happy that I'm doing these, these reactions because I'm sort of, in certain cases, I'm affirming what they're sharing. And then those areas where they are lacking, I'm adding additional context and additional value. And then the areas that are wrong, I'm never attacking the person. I'm attacking the concept. That's a big deal. Don't attack their character. Never. Because I mean, we're all human and I've made plenty of mistakes in my life and I would never want to call someone out for a mistake they're, they're making. But I do want people to be well informed about things that could potentially impact their real life. So when I talk about a subject that has been shared online, that is not quite accurate, I try again to be tactful about it, but it's always about the item, the, the topic, the subject matter. It's never about the person. And I think that that's endeared a lot of people, even when I disagree with what they're sharing. And I, like, I'll tell them exactly why I disagree. They're always pretty happy about the experience, right? I had a situation that just happened within the past two weeks where I commented, the person made an outreach to me saying they were really unhappy about the experience. And then we just got on a call and he's like, you're so right. I'm so happy we had this thing. And now we're probably going to do some collaboration in the future. And because his goal is to teach athletes about finance because a lot of professional athletes leave at the sport and they leave and don't have any good financial, they don't have any good financial management. And then they end up making major mistakes with their money. So he's, he's aimed at a really good outcome to help people become financially literate. And I want to support that. But yeah, I mean, we, we took our, our following by just doing these reaction videos to that less than 6,000 followers in April of 23, through less than 10 months to now more than 2.9 million followers, all organic, no pay dads, no paid followers, all organic and a highly engaged community too. So when we post, we typically get somewhere between 40 to 60,000 views at the same day. And then we'll get hundreds, we'll get, we'll get hundreds of comments, hundreds of DMs per day per post. So very, very highly engaged. And it's, it's just been remarkable. Like it's, it's totally something foreign to me, because I didn't grow up building businesses this way. But it has been a dramatic shift in, in the amount of humans that we're able to actually serve and add value to. And yeah, it's been, been quite remarkable. Okay, so you said that your, your community sources the videos, are they DMing it to you? Or there's a form or how's that work? Yeah, we, we did a couple stories early on in this immediate growth, right? Because we had, we had a few days where back to back days, we'd get like 8,000, 10,000 new followers. Over a course of a couple weeks, we get 50, 100,000 followers within like a month or two, we already hit 300,000 followers across the social. So we did started doing these stories where we're saying, if you, or we would add like a called action at the end of whatever I was sharing. And we'd say things like if you are interested in, or you find content that you'd want someone else to take a look at, send them our way. And then we, we actually by accident created this tagline, which has now become pretty infamous or famous, I guess, in some way on socials, called Edward Verified, right? So a lot of people now send us these videos and they want to know, is this Edward Verified? And that was a complete accident by the way. Just one time you dropped that or something? Yeah. So again, the way I do my reactions is, again, I don't know what I'm watching ahead of time. So I'm watching it for the first time. And then I'm putting the phone down and I'm either correcting something, adding additional value, trying to do something. And I watch this one video and I put the phone down and I'm looking at everyone. I'm like, I don't have anything to add. This is correct. Like a hundred percent. Like, if I were saying this, I would have said that. And they're like, well, you got to say something. And I'm like looking and I'm like, what am I supposed to say? And they're like, I don't know. You have to say something. I'm like, okay, this is legit. So we're verified. And that was it. That was the end of the video. And then literally that day, people started DMing and commenting and adding other people's like making comments on other people's posts with the hashtag, is this Edward Verified or Edward Verified? It was like crazy. Like, it was literally like within within a day or two of that post. And now that's become the thing. So people send us these DMs and these comments. Is this Edward Verified or they'll comment on someone else's post. Is this Edward Verified? And then another tagging you and everything. Yeah, 100%. It's crazy. So interesting. Are the people in your market modeling and copying us now? Are they a lot of people? I think, again, there's value in finding what works for you. Like, I think the real reason why we've had such a rise, if you will, is because of the fact that I'm just me now on camera. Like, in the beginning, I was trying to be someone that everyone was telling me I should be. In the social media. Yeah, I was like, like, trying to be all proper and focused. And I wasn't being my authentic self. And when I was just literally watching it for the first time and then commenting based on my initial experience, like, there's no script. So obviously, it's going to be me. And then I think that that's what resonated with people. Now, don't get me wrong. I know that a lot of people don't like me, like, because not everyone will, because I have very strong opinions about certain things. Like, I literally hate the IRS and I think taxation is theft and I've made your problems with government for a variety of reasons. So a lot of people don't like that. And they're very vocal about that. But just adds the algorithm. 100%. And but those that do resonate with your authentic you, they are really resonating with it. And you can make a connection with people in so many crazy ways. I know you are truly celebrity when it comes to this sort of stuff. I'm very new to it. So I get stopped in the airport from people and like, hey, you're Edward Verified. My family and I, because we don't believe in giving like gifts to each other, we rather give experiences. So we travel a lot. I have two little ones. So my son, Ryan, who, you know, my daughter, Victoria, who, you know, 10 and eight respectively, we go away a lot for the holidays. So we went to South Africa this past Christmas season. So we went through Christmas and into the new year. But we flew by way of Heathrow to get to South Africa. And in Heathrow, like, two different people at different locations, the airport came up to me like, you're Edward, Edward Collins, Edward Verified. I'm like, Oh, yeah, man. It's like so surreal. What do your kids think about that? My son, Ryan, has this statement that he often says, I try to discourage him all the time. My daddy's famous. And I'm not, I'm just a guy. Like, I'm just a guy who's online telling people what I believe to be of value. I share who I am pretty authentically, make tons of mistakes in my life as everyone human does. And I just try to serve. My kids the same thing. They always like dad got spotted, dad got spotted. And that's point now, every time we go out, I get spotted somewhere and they think it's always just waiting in there. Oh, that guy, you know, and nor my littlest one is funny. She always wants to talk to the people or she's the click funnel shirt on and she's like, yeah, they're click for sure. Go talk to them. Like, I'm like, I'm like scared. Like, oh, I'm not doing it. Okay. I actually want to do this. So I got you just going to pull up and we'll make sure everyone can see at home. But do you want to do want to like show a couple of these and just talk through them and just curious. Like, thoughts or how you're doing some people like you hear the concept. But I think when I start looking at them and seeing it, it's like, Oh, this is what you're actually doing. So you can grab any random one. Yeah, I mean, I just literally plug anyone there because they're all the pretty much the same. Let's go again. How are you taking yourself from liability with the gym? And so what's happening is again, someone has sent this video to us. And I'm literally watching it for the first time. You can see my face do some weird things because I can't control it. And then Arizona LLC is owned by he'll go through his commentary. I'm listening to it. Set it up like that and have a holding LLC in one of these three states Wyoming, Delaware, or Nevada, because they're non piercing states. And what that means is it protects you from the inside attack. But it also protects you from the outside attack. An inside attack would be a tenant slipping and falling or a guest drowning in the pool. An outside attack would be you getting in a car accident with a motorcyclist here in San Diego. And that motorcyclist suing you to get out, get into properties that are out of state. So when you have an LLC holding LLC in Wyoming, Delaware, Nevada, it prevents that piercing from happening. This legit number verified what's being described here is layering of entities in order to get all of the protections possible. You see, I have something called the real wealth matrix, which is the ideal hierarchy of ownership over everything in your life. When you leverage an LLC by itself, you get statutory protection, sort of like a force field around your business. But when you layer in a Wyoming LLC, you get sort of like a cloak of invisibility because no one knows what you own because your name is not on a public record. Now, if you don't know how to put all these pieces together, you want to be in the right rooms with the right people asking the right questions so you can get the right answers. I have such a community called up level. If you want more information, drop the word up level. I'll send it your way. So that's an example. I did a CTA at the end. You most have CTA or no, not all the time. From time to time, and we're trying to be strategic with that. But quite frankly, this is not scripted. So if I feel it in the moment that it makes sense for me to say something, I'll just say it because that's not pre recorded. That's not like a separate thing that we're adding to it. I'm literally saying it in the moment based on what I just watched. Because I don't know what the video is. So I'm clicking play. I'm like, oh, okay, well, this is this is now structural structure. And a lot of people have questions about that. It's hard to get answers because there are a lot of people who don't understand that even lawyer like I'm a lawyer. So there's plenty of lawyers have no clue about how to actually organize your life, both from the context of just statutory protections, but also understanding the the practical application of doing that. And whether or not it's simple or challenging and what the what are the tax ramifications of doing certain things. So I'm like, okay, well, this makes sense for me to then say something about a community. So I'll literally just say it. But there are your phone lock your phone lock. But but that's the same concept. Like all of our videos are relatively similar in structure, right? I'm watching someone else's content. And then I'm going to say something, right? So I've essentially hacked you with the concept of hook story offer. Right? Why? Because what what is the hook? The hook is there's some guy watching someone else talk about something. What's going on here? And there's like the suspense that gets built because the question is, what am I going to say? Like, is this going to be positive or negative? Probably try to guess. Exactly. I was watching, I was trying to guess like, is this legit or not? Like, exactly. Right. And and then the story is when I put the phone down and I comment, right? And then the offer is either an overt one, like a call to action, right? Jump into our community, get this PDF or because I try to deliver as much value as I can. So we give a lot of a lot of stuff away for free. Or if it's a more of a hidden CTA, the hidden CTA that's ever present is if you like this content, follow so you can make sure you get the next one. Right? So it's sort of like always a hook story offer. It's just on how we've designed it. And all of the all the people that I've been noticing now in social media, because I'm trying to become a student of this, since we are putting a lot of effort into it, everyone seems to be doing something like that, right? They're, everyone has some sort of hook. And again, whatever the concept is, it could be something that's physical, maybe something they're wearing, it could be a visual, like what what is the room they're in? Like, if you look at my feed, I have an amazing team behind me, because it's definitely not me. I don't know any of that stuff. I don't know how to get the lights to turn different colors and like all that sort of stuff. I have an amazing team behind us that that physically curates the visual experience and the audio experience. And then I'm just the talking head of, yeah, I'm just doing me. Like, and that's the thing that's interesting. But if you notice anyone who's doing well in social media, it's always, again, hook story offer, it's always present. And that's why like I'm like, I'm obsessed now and looking at what other people are doing and saying, okay, well, what's working and why does that work? Yeah, reverse engineering and senior. That's really the big thing. I mean, that's that's pretty much what I teach other business owners how to do in business and then wealth creation. Like, if anything is possible, you can reverse engineer the steps to get there. And that's what we've been doing now. I love this because like, I feel like so many ways that we're taught social media, they're all there's a lot of ways that are great. A lot of them are, I know for me as a creator, too, it's like, my team's like, here's a script you got to read or here's the end. It's like, it's so hard because someone had to come up with the idea and then write a script and I got to perform it. What does it feel like? You know, it's like so much, so much work and anxiety. It's hard versus this is like, you just show up and it's like show up. Yeah, it's such an interesting, like so much faster to create something that's working so much better. Yes. No, first, first question is how often are you posting these the daily that we do post every day, but I film in batches, right? So I'll walk in and my team will load like five, six different videos on my phone and I'll just hit play. They're hitting record, I hit play, put it down talk, pick it up, hit play, put it down talk. So like just getting through it. It's pretty quick, relatively speaking, the batch through them. And then I have an editor, my editor does all the editing and we literally just put it then on the calendar for when it gets published, like because we have a whole project management system that we try to leverage in order to be as efficient as we possibly can. How like in a batch day, how many, or day, an hour, how long? Yeah, it's usually about an hour, maybe up to two hours, depending on how many we're trying to batch because I do travel a lot still. We have businesses in different states, we have real estate in different states. You're going to be noisy to hang out here. Yeah, come out the boys that hang out with you and learn the real sauce, right? But yeah, it's definitely necessary to coordinate that because I have learned that if you are not consistent, it does become a challenge, right? And if you're interested in really growing a community online and being able to serve, you do need to be present. And if you take too much time away from doing it, it can be a challenge. Now, luckily, I have an amazing team that helps facilitate all of this, right? So one person, I could not do it, at least not with my technical lack of expertise there. But we've been posting now literally every day since January 22, January 1st, 2022. And so the first year and four months you said before the first reaction video, and since then, it's just blown up. Yeah. I think you said it was multiple counts, right? It's not just all one as well. So we have an Instagram account, we have a Facebook account, we have a TikTok account, we have a YouTube channel, which we are just launching. So this will be fun to figure out how we can try to repurpose some of this content. But yeah, it's all the socials, essentially, and collectively now across all of them, we're at just about 2.9 million. It is the same reaction working on these other platforms? They have. They've worked across the board. We are evolving our YouTube presence to be much more long form. So what I'm doing is I will do a reaction video, but some, it's really hard to get a lot of good value in just 90 seconds, right? So to me, it's logical. The next step is to give them more. So a CTA is if you love this, comment the word YouTube, and I'll send you a link to a video that we'll post on it. Or if I get enough comments on this, I'll create a video on this. Yeah, 30 minute video and deep on this thing. And that's been some of our best performing content on YouTube, right? Here's the one that like, you want to say like something secret? Yeah, please. A lot of people are concerned about the algorithm and how the algorithm works. All algorithms are exactly the same. What I mean by that is they just care about keeping people on their platform, right? So if you create content, whatever that is, whatever your hook story offer is that keeps people there and present and interacting, they're going to reward you. They'll push that content out to more people. So again, whether it's 15 seconds or doing this, whatever it is, it's about can you keep someone's attention for a period of time where the algorithm notices and then wants to send it to more people who just paid attention to you. So you can sort of hack that concept. But here's the thing, a lot of people will use things like link and bio to get them to move. The algorithm hates that because that gets people off the platform. So the way you can get a similar outcome is just request the viewer to comment a certain word as an example. And then that could be used in the DMs to link them to outside content, right? To link them to things like your YouTube channel or to a landing page or to a lead magnet of some sort and often whatever it may be, which is amazing, right? Because now you get to essentially capture an audience that currently TikTok owns or Facebook owns or Instagram owns in some way and you can capture that lead and then continue to cultivate that through email campaigns and newsletters and community building. There's so many different ways to do it. And again, this is all something so new to me, right? Comparatively speaking, because I've been doing what I've been doing for 26 years and what I've been doing in this environment, this ecosystem, this iteration has been only about two years old. So it's so cool. So fascinating. My next question then is you see a lot of people, especially like the famous people, right? Like people, my kids all follow. They've used social followings, all sorts of stuff, but most of them are broke and they're not making money or whatever it is. I'm curious, like, how has this affected your business now? Oh, yeah, definitely. What does it actually look like? So I think one of the things you have to recognize is you have to have a plan, right? If you're going into it without a plan, then yeah, that's why you end up broke, right? It's like, if you don't, if your goal is to get to California, you can figure out wherever you may be, how to get around obstacles. But if you don't know where you're going, like, how do you get around an obstacle when it presents itself? And a lot of people will go into things and they'll wing it. They won't have a game plan or or and even an idea of what they want to get a return on their investment for. And I think that's the biggest challenge with a lot of things in life. So I go into pretty much everything I do with with a mindset of I want to know what my return on investment is going to be before I decide to commit anything. So we've noticed that when we are generating a significant amount of attention, right, that we can redirect that attention in ways that potentially could turn into a customer or turn into at least a relationship that we can cultivate over time that eventually could turn into a customer. And that curation process is that's what I'm referring to it internally. We're essentially curating our audience and cultivating them into an opportunity where I can convert them into a prospect. My definition as a audience is just someone who's interested as like I got a little bit of their attention. But that prospect is someone who is like, I'm in a position to essentially buy whatever it is you have. It doesn't mean they've bought, but they're in a position to. And then the closing environment is where you actually make them an actual customer, an actual client, someone who's who's exchanged their dollars for your value. Yeah, I view the world in funnels. That's, you know, it's a funnel. You have here's Instagram with the powers, three billion people. And then from there, you've got your millions, so the million followers. And then from there, it's like, and again, I think a lot of people like stop step one, step two, because they want influence. They want to be famous or whatever, you know, it's like, yeah, I'm the same way. Yeah, I really don't care about that at all. I care about it because I want the attention, right? And I want to be able to direct the attention in a way because again, I'm trying to do value forward in everything I do. So even if I can direct your attention, you never become a client. Everything I'm trying to do is you are better for having given me your attention. Like you will have learned something. You will have been able to say, okay, at least now I learned enough where I can ask the right questions of those who are in my life that actually I rely on, right? Whether that's an accountant and a lawyer, a financial professional, whatever it may be. So no matter what, they're better for what I've done. And if they become a client, I'm actually positioned well to be able to serve them if I can actually add value, I want to do that, right? Because I'm an unapologetic capitalist. I 100% believe if I can add value, it's my moral obligation to tell you I can. Because it's like, if you have the cure for a horrible disease, like you would be horrible not to share that, right? So that's my thought process across the board. And I think a lot of people will jump into social media for the celebrity aspect of it. And I've just never been interested in that. I know that there's a reason to go that route, to capture more and more attention. But I'm not doing it for the celebrity aspect of it. I'm doing it to be able to push people into an environment where they're better. So walk me through what your funnel looks like, your goal. So again, here's all of Instagram. Here's your people, they're seeing your stuff, where you try to see it. And maybe there's one funnel, maybe there's a lot of you doing webinars for the most part, like what that looks like, where you're pushing people towards. We're essentially redesigning everything now, because we're purely organic, right? We don't do any paid advertising, although I need to change that based on your, because you've told me, like, why not, Edward? Do you hate money? You're doing stuff, Miesville? Yeah. It's funny because I was the other paid people, like, I don't do any organic, no organic people. I don't do any paid. I'm like, why don't you guys do both? Like, there's a big, I get it. It makes all the sense of the world. So my team has now has that direction, right? And they're the ones who are going to support us in that transition process. But we essentially have an organic funnel. So our short fork content is essentially leading to long form, right? So we want to shift people from TikTok and Instagram and Facebook to YouTube, because that gives me an opportunity to really spend time with people virtually. And I could get to leverage that experience, because I can record that video once, and people can watch it over and over again, or thousands of people can watch it, hundreds of thousands of people can watch it. So you get economies of scale when you do that. And what we're doing is from then the YouTube or the long form, then we push into community, right? And inside of community is where we essentially funnel everyone, right? So it's designed to be able to create a free community, free community that is still gated, right? Meaning we need to capture your name, your email address, your, your contact information, right? And then you get access to the free, but inside of the free community, there are things that you don't have access to, because they require ascension, right? They require some sort of upgrading. But they can see them, right? They can see all the different things that they have the potential of accessing and taking value. And depending on where they are in their journey, I can help navigate them to, you may want to consider this course, or you may want to consider this, this mastermind, or you may want to consider this private client group. And then they can choose to raise their hand and say, Hey, Edward, I'm interested. So the, the conversion process for us is relatively, I don't want to say easy because nothing is ever easy, but it is simple. It's like, I'm developing a relationship with people over time, leveraging something that I put in a lot of energy in up front, but I get to use it over and over and over and over again, like infinitely, and essentially still, still continue to add value the entirety of that time. And again, give people an opportunity to say, Hey, listen, Edward, I'm over here. I'd really like that. And they essentially are, are closing themselves. I do ever do this. I was, it's always fun for me. I got first time I ever did it was in an event. It was a fun, like a live event with 5,000 people. We talked for four days. I started doing the math, like if I was sitting down with one person and the next person, like how many hours that would have been and how many years, like it was like 30 something years. I think about it with YouTube, like for example, this video probably get who knows 30, 50,000 people. And from that, we had a chance to sit, we were faced by face to 30,000 people and explain what you're doing and give them enough belief. And then the tools to do it, it would take us 10 years, right? But one video now does that and it leverages it. You know, you think about how much content you put out that I, again, I'm a big ROI guy, less on the money side, more like everything. If I'm doing a video or conversation, like what's ROI on the thing. And I started thinking about this and it's like, man, this conversation is just rubbing right now, the ROI that'll come from that. And then, you know, every video you post on your scene. And then I'll think about this, like, you know, when we pass away or whatever, those videos are still there. Like it's, it keeps, it's true legacy going for so long. It's true legacy. Yeah. So I think anyone who's, a lot of times I think people get nervous because like you, like you jump in there and it's like, I'm going to spend a year and nothing's going to work. Like is it worth it? It's like, man, like it's, it's hard up front, but it's so worth it because of the long tail. And now, you know, who knows the next, how long, five years, 10 years, whatever your career is going to be before you decide you're disappearing back and ready to go to some more beaches. Like all of the stuff you're creating the impact that'll keep coming for generations to come. It's pretty amazing. Like when, when people really embrace technology, because there are only four ways to get leverage in business, right? You have, you have collaboration, which is you working with other humans, like whether they're your team, your employees, your staff, whatever it may be, your customers even collaborate with you. Then you have technology, right? Code, that environment where you can leverage the technology to enhance the collaborators, right? To the things that the collaborators are doing. Then you have community, which is an ability to take a vast number of other humans and make them your marketing team for you. And then you have capital, right? Putting other people's money to work to enhance all the other three. But when you, when you look at that concept, it is remarkable what you can actually accomplish. If you go into everything with how can I leverage? Okay, how can I leverage my time? How can I leverage other people's time? How can I leverage the outcomes that that my, my, those that I serve are going to get? All of that concept. And if you go into it with that mindset, you can dramatically change things. Like for instance, if you're in a sales meeting, right? So we're experimenting with this thing now, which is pretty interesting where typically you do these one-off sales. Like if, if, if, if the audience doesn't know like the whole sales environment and the process, like book to call funnels and things of that nature, it was very intimidating for me because it takes so much time and other humans time. So we're experimenting with this thing where our sales engagements, our sales conversations are going to happen in group. We just did one where we had a bunch of different individuals on the same call and I delivered the same exact pitch, if you will. And we, we saved, I think it was like seven or seven or 10 hours worth of time. This is one-on-one calls. With one-on-one calls for that few minutes that I was able to spend on with just the group at the same time and they converted it, right? And, and the, then that's where, then I started to then analyze, well, how much, how much leverage did I get there? Was that a good return on the investment? Are there ways to enhance it even further? How could I add things like video warm-ups to that call where they can then experience like precursor events prior to getting on that call and even on the call, how do I curate the call, maybe curating other content and do a facilitated oriented event? Like what you're, what you're espousing, like I'm sitting in an inner circle meeting and I'm like, I'm taking notes from what you're sharing in my teams. I have my, my director of implementation here and he's taking notes and we're like, well, we're going to have to sit down now on Saturday and like redesign this, this process because again, it's all, it's all about taking advantage of the resources you have available to you in the most efficient and effective way possible. If your goal is to have success. Now, everyone's going to have a different definition of success, but the milestones of success are usually pretty similar. Whether they're monetary, whether they're, they're time freedom, whatever it may be, you just have to figure out what your definition is and as long as it is a possibility, you can reverse engineer the steps. But I have this, this way of talking about it. Like I never try to teach someone that's impossible, right? Cause I have no idea if it's possible. So like, for instance, if someone asked me how to get to Pluto, I have no clue. Like I don't know anyone has ever been there, right? But if you asked me how to get to 30,000 feet, I can tell you that cause it's possible, right? Go to the airport, buy a ticket, go through security, get to the gate, get on the plane and take on, basically stay on the plane while it takes off. You'll get to 30,000 feet cause that's where they fly. So since it's a possibility, you convert, reverse, basically reverse engineer the steps. But here's the thing, most people will just stop in the reverse engineering, meaning they'll, they'll do the research, they'll sit down, they'll come to, to mastermind events and they'll take plenty of notes and they're like, Oh yeah, that's great. But that's not actually what gets outcome. The only thing that gets outcome is action. Like quite literally the only thing that gets outcomes you desire is taking action, but you have to be in the right rooms with the right people, asking the right questions so that you can get the right answers upon which you can take action. Yeah, I love that. All right. So those who are watching this video right now, let's get, let's reverse engineers for them. So they're like, I want to go on Instagram and I'm going to use this, this concept reaction video, stuff like that. They're just getting started, walk us through the steps in order. And then now they'll have a blueprint to go and execute on the find a video, watch the video, record you watching the video and literally comment based on your zone of genius, like whatever you are authentically good at or have knowledge about, and you don't have to be the most genius person in that topic. You just have to know more than the person who's going to align with you. Right? You have to just know just enough more than the person who needs the information that you have and then build a connection. And the best way to build a connection is just to be you, just to be, and I know that's really, really hard. It's hard when the camera goes on you for the first time. I struggled a lot with that, right? But if you're just you, you give an opportunity for someone to actually genuinely connect with the you, which means then you don't have to try to be someone else. That's really tiring. It's really, really exhausting to put on a mask. If you could just be you and connect with those who resonate, your life can change. Yeah. One of the principles I think about a lot, because I think most people when they first get into business, they do exactly what you did. They try to do it the way that everyone's doing it. And it's not authentic and doesn't work. And I hate that word like, you know, you're authentic self, but it's interesting because there's a biblical scripture. I love that Christ talks about it. So it's like, my sheep will hear my voice and they will, they will come to me with one fold, one shepherd. And while that was obviously true with him and Christianity, everything like is true for all of us. Like, I'm going to put my stuff out there and there's people that hate Russell Brunson. You go on like page three or four Google, there's people that hate me down there, but my people hear my voice and they're here and you're in voice and like, these are my people and I can serve them and everything like that. And so you got to stop worrying about all the rest and just put yourself out there your way. And like, your people hear your voice, they'll come to you and you can serve them. And I strongly believe that everyone's been called to serve somebody on this planet. And it's like, until we're willing to put ourselves out there and do it, they're not going to hear our voices and they can't come to us. And so it's like, that's the, that's the call. That's the thing for you guys to do is to go out there and be willing to do it. And you and I have an unfair advantage though, right? We've come to realize that that's a truism, right? That's a real thing. I'm a stoic, so I try not to invest any energy I have in things I can't control and I try to put everything into those things I can. And when you think about it, like, you can't control anyone else's opinion of you, like at all, you can't control it. You could do so many good things and people can still have a bad opinion of you. So if that's true, why do you waste energy in what they think? Just be you and those who resonate will come to you. They'll hear your message, they'll hear your voice, they'll come in and they'll be interested and then serve because that's always the prerequisite. Like you want to talk about the steps. The first step is come from a position of actually wanting to add value because all money follows value creation. Like if you go out and create value for someone, money is the natural byproduct of that process. And if you're concerned about the money thing, well, the reality is like, again, I'm an unapologetic capitalist. Money is just a tool and there's nothing good or bad about it. It's how it's utilized. And you can actually get financial resources and do amazingly good things with those things. And again, I think you could do if you're a good steward of your resources, you're way better at managing them than anyone in Washington DC ever would be. Again, I'm pretty firm in my beliefs. I 100% agree with you, by the way. So yes. Yes. That's why we resonate. Yeah. That's awesome. Well, thanks, man, for sharing. I think it's cool. So I'm going to commit to you right now. Please. I'm going to do my very first reaction video next week. I love it. And so my team's back here. We got to find a really cool video from your react on. And then I'm glad you told me that the surprise anything. I was going to like bet them ahead of time so I could be like, that's actually better. So yeah, this way you don't have to worry about scripting it out. You just get to talk. Yeah. And you're also like amazing at what you do. So you can talk about an infinite number of ways to tackle a similar situation. Exactly. For me, and I'm seriously, I don't have to pull it from just marketers. It's like anything. I can talk about an ad or this or the whole sorts of things. Everything relates to what you do. Yeah. But that's true for everything, right? So no matter what you do, anyone who's watching this, right? No matter what you do, everything relates to it because that's your zone of genius. You can always connect and make ties to it. And as long as you speak from an authentic position, speak about something you actually know, and come to that particular scenario from the position of wanting ad value, it's hard to lose. It doesn't mean you're going to get the first video to take off. I didn't. It took me a year and four months to get anything. So just be diligent, right? That's where it comes down to it. You have to put in the reps. Like at the end of the day, it's not, you're not going to get six pack abs from like three visits to go. Yeah. I was like, I have a couple of different content types really focusing on and I'm going to add this as one of them. So it should be something we're doing once twice a week, just in the queue. And so I'm excited to see. So next time you go back here and boy see, I'll show it. And I always, I'm very competitive. So like with YouTube, I'm trying to beat Myron Gold and a girl on YouTube. But now my next goal is to, so what's your biggest reaction? You know, the most views you've got so far because that's my goal. I got you. Okay. That's a big goal. All right. Three million views. I think it's three million. Is there more? Yeah. Something like that. I think we have one that's like eight million. Eight million? Yeah. Man, you just made it way harder. All right. So we're going for, we're going for nine figures. Well, three million was just recent. That was like last week. Okay. All right. 10 million. We're going to, so, and hopefully you don't pass me. So we're racing now. You know, I'm very competitive too. It's going to happen. This was fun. This was fun. Awesome. Thanks for being here. You guys, 100% creative reaction video. Be consistent. Put some stuff out there and change the world. That's the game plan. So thanks everyone. Thank you, man. I appreciate it. Well, bye for now.
