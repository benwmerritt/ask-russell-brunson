Hey, what's up everybody? This is Russell Brunson. Welcome back to the show. Excited to be hanging out with you guys today and mostly excited because today I can talk about one of my favorite topics of all time And excited to go deep on it with you guys now the title I have for this presentation for the video for the podcast where you want to call it is it's the master key that unlocks all success And I've been geeking out over the last I mean honestly two decades of my life three decades of my life Trying to figure out how to be successful in wrestling and then in business other things in my life My family with my kids. They all sorts of stuff like a geek out on it. I buy a lot of books I study I go like like to the you know, the obsessive compulsive level. I think I'm at like 18,000 books I've bought in the last two years all based on success Yeah, so I'm into it deep and I want to simplify so much of it for you It's because there's a lot of stuff and you can get down the weeds and the rabbit holes But there's some things that are really really simple and you understand them. It literally is the key I'm calling it the master key. Nepoli Hills call He has a course called master keys Charles Handel has a course called master keys Both these guys have courses from way back in the early 1900s But this for me is like my version of that This is the master key that we understand this and you plug it in and you use it It can literally unlock all your success in any area of your life I don't care if you're trying to be like be more successful non-preneur as a fat as a father as a wife as a spouse as a Like as an athlete like whatever it is like this key is the key and it's so simple and so powerful after you understand it And so I'm gonna spend some time going deep into today. So if you guys cool with that, I'm gonna jump right in I got three core things. I'm gonna talk about Each one will go kind of deep on because they're all they all kind of build upon the other So make sure you don't skip to the end I'm making sure you don't miss anything because first one builds on second which builds on third and then and we place all three Together, it's like oh, that's the secret. That's the whole key and so that's kind of game plan that we're gonna go deep into right now So hope you guys are fun with that. Hope you're okay with that cuz I'm it's gonna be a lot of fun for me And I just enjoy talking about the stuff. So let me know in the comments down below if you're cool with that And if so, I'm gonna jump right in. Okay. So the first thing you got to understand This is one of my favorite things to study and to learn about is Understanding the difference in the conscious mind and the subconscious. Okay, I talk a lot about this If you've ever been to my selling online event, I go deep in this but from a standpoint of like helping Like learning how to sell people stuff, right? Because I'm having a calm conscious conversation with somebody before I want to sell them I'm actually Speaking in a way that I'm speaking directly to their subconscious mind because that's what gets them to break their false belief patterns It's them to move and you have to understand how to do that So I have a whole event about that like in context of selling but this one I want to explain it in context For you just understanding your life and why you do the things you do and why you sometimes don't do the things you want to do Right and it all comes down to this conscious and subconscious Cal these two these two minds of ours work. Okay, and I can get deep into like the You know the science behind it. I just want you guys to understand what you need to understand to be successful with it Okay, so the first thing you understand is that Like my default when we're born as kids like we're blank slate right and everything we're learning is patterns We're learning these patterns and they get ingrained into our body into our mind and that's like that's the the like really what's happening So constantly we decided like hey, I want to go do this thing You know and like I think one of the easy examples to think about is like let's say when you want to learn a car the first time Right, you jump behind the car and you're consciously happy me aware of all these things right? Okay? Here's the steering wheel. Here's the clutch if you're you know old school like me or like, you know, here's the things Here's the radio. Here's that and so like all these things you're driving you're trying to stay within lines You're like consciously keep going back and forth like you know stay in line stay the line You know you go about back and forth you try to figure out where you're going and you got a map and you're trying and like you're consciously doing all Stuff that's why the very first time that you that you drive somewhere. It's really hard. It's really difficult thing, right? But then what happens is we do it once we do it a second time a third time and a fourth time right? We keep consciously doing the consciously we're doing this thing but it builds a subconscious pattern, right? And so eventually you jump in the car and you start driving and you don't even know what's happening Your brain is constantly thinking about something else You're all these things are happening and your subconscious mind is like I know how to give them to the office and boom We show up to the office right and you get out your car. You're like, how'd I get here? I don't know I even got here or sometimes you think you're gonna go somewhere else But then you stop paying attention your subconscious mind will take you to where you know like you end up the office like I'm trying Go to church like what just happened, right? Because it's that the pattern so there and so all we say is consciously I want to go this place Subconscious mind takes over the pattern happens and then boom we just go okay And so these patterns happen over and over and over again Like the first time we do something it's consciously sometimes consciously third time We keep doing it over and over and over again until it becomes a pattern and then becomes part of us, okay in sports athletics A lot of times they call us muscle memory, right? Again, I don't know I don't understand conscious or subconscious back then but I was competing as an athlete That's what they said like you got to drill something so many times it becomes muscle memory It's just part of you, right? And that's what we're talking about, right? I was in wrestling practice like consciously would sit with the coach and they say okay Here's how you do a single leg right and you go through here's where the arm goes in the other arm And we walk through all the pieces right and then we drill and we drill and we drill and we drill and we drill that same move Hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of times, right? It's like I'm not like I think it's not that hard to get the move, right? But I'm doing is I'm taking this consciously. I'm turning into a subconscious reaction, right? And so I know that like when somebody moves this way, right? I'm not thinking okay person step here now. I'm gonna go take a shot, right? Instead what happens is you've got so many times your subconscious mind just feels it all since like like there's a there's less pressure Something's opening here something's moving and you don't even know what's happening But boom your subconscious mind because you've drilled it so many times consciously It's become subconscious and your subconscious mind just takes it and it happens Okay, and it's really fascinating and the reason why it's so important I was doing some studies and looking this up like the speed of our conscious mind versus our subconscious mind It's like our conscious mind can handle like I think it's like 50 bits per second or something that were a subconscious like 400 billion bits per second. It's it's insane. In fact the stat I found and there's a bunch of stats They all kind of conflict a little bit, but basically was 27,500 times faster But that's the speed difference, right? And so when I started wrestling again as an old man I started going these tournaments was crazy cuz I got there to start wrestling and I would be I mean Rusty on there also I see the move like there's the move like his legs open and my but I'm very conscious, right? Cuz I've been doing it so I was conscious I go to shoot and I'm like slow and by time Halfway there the guys legs already gone because I move so slow, right? That's what's happening. We're conscious Okay, but when you get back to spot you're drilling you're drilling you're so it gets in your subconscious You're not thinking yours out there playing here in front all sense like boom You just go because you felt it subconsciously 27,500 times faster right that much faster boom your brain just just subconscious goes Right, that's why they always talk about if you're in your head You're dead because it's like as an athlete if you're in your head you're consciously thinking okay What I do now what are you now right? It's when you get out of consciousness in subconscious That's when you get into flow stay and you can do so much more because your subconscious so much faster because it's built patterns And you've done those patterns so many times that just your breath par your brain takes over and it's so much faster than your conscious mind Okay, so anytime you're doing things consciously. That's when you struggle I see this happening when I'm speaking on stage if I'm on stage and I'm very conscious like I'm like Too slide driven or too much like I get out of the rhythm and it's just hard to explain where like I'll get in a spot where I'm doing something also like I don't know what happens if I like something else takes over and And and it's just it's a different experience like I I can tell the times I'm teaching constantly versus subconsciously when I'm teaching Subconsciously like that's when magic happens really people are crying like things are happening Like and it's hard to get to that point But it's just tons and tons and tons of repetition that transition you from conscious subconscious right and so it's it's the key Now a couple things to note And this is gonna set up the next part so it's important to understand this I had a really good coach one time and he asked everyone he's you know We're practice or practice anything over and over and over again He says he says What do you know about practice and some of my teams like practice makes perfect and my coach is like well That's not actually true. We're like what are you talking about? Then why are we practicing all day right you're trying to get perfect and he said perfect practice makes perfect Okay, so this is what happened. I see this every actually every jump right wrestled in middle school I wrestled in high school. I wrestled at college or so like you know train at Olympic level Never got to compete that level, but I trained there So like what's interesting is that the each level what happens is you come in with your good habits and your bad habits, right? So as a kid, I'm learning a single leg and you know my coaches my dad everyone's like just trying to get me to actually shoot like just Just just grab like shoot grab their legs right so I do it and eventually I get better I get pretty good at cuz I've done it so many times and like I have some success, you know I'm aggressive so like I start winning some matches that way and it's like cool I'm good on my feet right I'm gonna shooting and taking people down Then I get to the high school level and also go out there and like I didn't realize this by that Bad habits. I'm standing too straight my elbows are out like it didn't affect me at this level because Because you know the kids weren't that good, but the next level those kids who are better than me Like they pick it apart really like you're out of positioning on stance. It's really easy to beat me So like I have to go back and relearn the pattern like I have this pattern that I've been doing in middle school Right I go to I go to high school and the pattern doesn't work anymore Right like to break the pattern after redo it So I have to come back after relearn how to shoot how to keep my elbows in I keep my arms small how to keep like in Instance like they shoot over and so I all through high school for next four years I'm drilling drilling and building this new muscle memory I guess better and better and better the spot where I get to a certain level right for me It was like I became a state champ went to went to a national took second place in the country I was really good right and then I got a college scholarship So I go to college and show up the very first day and again. I'm I'm a state champ I'm second place in the country all American like I think I'm just kill it when I walk in this room with these college kids And I get destroyed and it was humbling for like what just happened like I'm I'm really good Like how are these guys beating me so bad and I realized just cuz I had been practicing to that level But I was out of positioning in so many places. I didn't know right I get the next level And it's like these guys are so much better that I can't do things sloppy my hips are out This like little little tiny little nuances like changed everything So I had to go learn how to read like rebuild these patterns in a way where I could be the guys in the next level Okay, and so I saw it so much in in in wrestling every single every single area to go to right but the key was like understanding first off that like That by just just by default you have these patterns, right? Whatever level you are okay now Obviously, I'm sure I got a handful wrestlers listening this most you guys aren't wrestlers You're mostly you guys are entrepreneurs we're listening and so I want to liken this to entrepreneurship Right and just any area of life actually with your family with your kids with with anyone, right? We have these patterns and the patterns starting when we were young right and we don't remember consciously making these but they happen Right and so the pattern it could be all sorts of things Tony Robbins talks about You know when you're a little kid and you're trying to get attention You get love and stuff and also like one kid goes and he trips and makes everyone laugh And he's like that day a comedian was born because you saw the pattern like I tripped they laughed I'm gonna do that again as we start doing funny things and like that's how you get love, right? And someone else like they tried a bunch of things and their family was paying attention to him and they went They achieved something right and all of a sudden like they saw they had successfully achieving He's like that day and achiever was born right because like if I achieve something something's gonna happen So like we start building these patterns up just based on things that are happening, right? As one word two years old three years old five years old ten years old right? We don't even know they're happening these patterns start happening, right? And a lot of times these patterns will serve you in some areas of life and they will hinder you in other areas of life Okay, but you're showing up to the to to your life right now with a whole bunch of patterns that have been programmed, right? It's me wrestling in middle school doing something that got me through life now I'm trying to operate this level and my pattern is wrong Okay, it was okay was good enough to let me win at that level But I'm at the next level now and like I just keep failing and failing and I don't understand why I'm so confused, right? And so that's the that's the first step to understand is that this is what's happening in our whole brain There's this conscious thing we want to do and we're building subconscious patterns, right? And the subconscious patterns if done correctly will lead you to the next level of success if done incorrectly We'll hold you back. Okay, and again a lot of times it's something that served you which is why it's so fresh I can say it served me for so long, but now it's not serving me, right? And it's understanding that it's coming back say, okay, I Mean a pattern that's not correct, right? My subconscious programming that got me to this level is not getting the next level I got to fix that. Okay, this is where most people make the mistake when they want success They're trying to figure out like I work harder. I work. I gotta do more things. I gotta that it's like no no Usually it's not that usually it's literally it's fixing this pattern. That's that you're struggling with okay So that's the first step is understand that okay now I'm gonna move to step number two, which is kind of building upon this right step number two then is understanding patterns and Man we had funnel hacking live two or three weeks ago whenever it was 20 Robbins came and spoke at the very end of it And as Tony does he shares a million cool things, but he shared one of my things one of the things I've heard him talk about a lot. It's one of my favorite things, but it's understanding patterns He's like patterns are the key to everything in life, right? Like when you start understanding like like everything's happening as a pattern somebody punches you you instantly are going to a pattern, right? You're subconsciously moving to a pattern Some you get a bad email more you instantly hit a pattern Somebody says something to you like someone honks that you like like a million different things, right? You you're scrolling on Facebook and something happens or Instagram or YouTube like like these patterns are just automatically being fired off from things You've been doing for last, you know, however Oh, how old you are right now all those years these sub conscious patterns you built to like survive life have been in the program Right and so it's happening is that these patterns keep happening and then you react to them And you don't even know right so trigger happens and then you react to the pattern and you're stuck in this pattern okay, and so What Tony talked about there's three levels of this and honestly when I when I met Tony Robbins back 15 16 years ago Like of all the things he did he did so many great things for me so many things that I learned and like I could go on like all the frameworks I learned from him But really like one of the most powerful things is he helped me become aware of my patterns And when you become aware of something you can actually do something about most of us Most people live their lives not even knowing that they have these patterns and they're frustrated that they're not having the success They want the happiness the want the health They want the whatever and then it realizes all just because these patterns They have their middle school wrestling patterns and they're trying to wrestle in college and they're not having success and they're just frustrated Like I'm working harder, but it doesn't matter if you're out of position Right for the analogy if I'm out of position those guys are gonna beat me every single time It's not me working harder. It's me realizing that that I practiced in perfectly in perfect perfect practice makes perfect Not practice makes perfect right so I had to come back to the drawing board Reset my patterns and then practice perfectly to build the correct patterns. Okay. All right, so here's Tony's three levels Patterns okay level number one. He says you have to recognize the pattern Okay, this is again the one of the greatest gifts I can give you is helping you to start recognizing patterns Okay, he said yet identify patterns in your life such as history or in your own habits or things that are happening Right, so what are the patterns? So I think about this all the time like with myself specifically like the same struggle with my wife I'm like, okay every time we get to this certain Circumstance or your situation whatever like things things unravel like why you know And most times like all we're so frustrated versus like okay, what's the pattern that's happening here? There's there's this input and then I'm slipping into a pattern. What is the pattern? Right, we figure that thing was you know, I'll share a really good example with this So growing up in wrestling a lot of you guys know wrestlers we cut weight like that's what we do Especially when I was in high school, we just cut a lot of weight In fact all the way until man my senior year in high school There were three kids in the country that all died from cutting weight So they they changed the like the rules and stuff which is way better for the sport But prior that like I would come in on on a Monday morning weighing 160 pounds and by Thursday I was weighing 130 so I'd lose 30 pounds and then by Sunday back to 130 or sorry 160 and by next Thursday back down Like I was losing 30 pounds a week weekend a week out, right? That's just the game and it's water weight So don't send me your health advice everyone always every time I talk about weight cutting people send me a health advice I'm like, you understand you don't lose 30 pounds by eating less calories Like you do it by like squeezing the water out of your body, right? It's a different. It's a different mindset But I did that every single week for 12 years of my life through middle school high school and college Like I was coming in and losing, you know 15 20 30 pounds every single week So it happened is like you were I was so strict all week long right like I ate healthy, you know Cut out water, you know all the things I'm not gonna teach you maybe I'll do a training in the future on how to cut weight That could be a whole different video that like four of you guys would care about But I don't pattern then we'd weigh in after way into your gets much nutrients to your body as possible because you're wrestling an hour later So you get the right nutrients like things get energy back up Then you got the Russell right and then you're like, hey, I have a week to this way So what do you do you eat everything you haven't eaten in five days? So you eat So much and you drink so much and it's just like you're consuming because you're like you're just starved, right? And so that I blow up gain my 60 you know back to 160 pounds Monday Kema jump on scale Oh crap 30 pounds over now We start the process eating perfectly dieting losing weight like all the stuff back down And so like that was the pattern for 12 years of my life. Okay, then I get done wrestling And I no longer competing my wife and I are You know living our life. She we have twins She gets pregnant twins, you know, and it's a funny season of our life because she's now got two babies inside of her And so she's eating for two I just got done wrestling and so I like no longer working out and my wife's eating ton of food I'm gonna eat food too. So we should both start eating and both of us gain in the next, you know Four or five months we both gain like 50 60 pounds, right? And so I'm like You know and she's big because she's pregnant and then the craziest thing happened one day December 11th She has twin babies and loses like 50 pounds overnight and I'm sitting here like My weight's still here, right and I had that weight for the next eight years could not get off It's trying everything and when I started realizing I started seeing to myself is I would come in every single Monday I eat super no Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday I see my weight dropping dropping dropping then Friday would happen Weekend starts what I would do. I just made a weight and I'd go in all weekend long Boom boom boom come back with a weekend I was like I gained a pound right from the from the weekend prior and I lose weight lose weight lose weight lose weight We can party you eat a ton of food. You know, this is Mormon parties Listen to me just eating a lot of food go to Burger King and eating yeah all sorts of stuff, right? And then start and so like for eight years. I was this this cycle happening over and over and over and it's crazy It wasn't until my friend Carrie Woodward. She And she had wrestling brothers and stuff but she looked at me one day and she's like you realize you have an eating disorder, right? Like what are you talking about? I'm an eating disorder and she's like no you do She's like look at like the pattern you literally are in the same pattern that you were in your entire wrestling career Like you eat healthy eat flawless like perfectly execution and the weekends you gain it all back And you do that thing and like you're in the exact same cycle at the last eight years You've been doing for the 12 years prior and I was like, oh my gosh And suddenly I was aware of the pattern which is phase number one right recognizing the pattern I recognize the pattern. This is why I can't lose any weight. There's this pattern that was built subconsciously, right? And and and it's there and I didn't even know it was there So if I don't know what's there it controls me forever unless I'm aware of it I can't fix it. So number one step in one phase one write this down tattoo it to your hand Recognize the pattern. What is the pattern you're rolling into? Okay again health fitness business, whatever it is, right? What is the pattern that is negatively holding you back? You have to recognize it? Okay phase number two now in Tony's process is then you have to learn how to use the patterns Okay, so after you see the patterns like okay now. I know this is my pattern How do I use that pattern for my for my good, right? So for me with the eating thing was like, okay Now I know this so my if I can just survive Saturday and Sunday and Friday night Saturday and Sunday I'm gonna be okay, right? It's the pattern is the weekends I'm gonna party because I feel like I made weight so I can eat whatever I want, right? And so for me it was like, okay now I know the pattern. I'm aware of it I recognize it and I can use that pattern, right? So I start figuring out how to use that pattern. How do I use that in a way that this can be beneficial? So for me it was like, okay now I know this is my weak spot So I got a four to five myself. How do I make sure Friday Saturday and Sundays? I'm good and then when I do that then Monday starts now I'm starting back off again, right? And so I started tweaking things around and so and I might go deep into all the things I was doing but Soon as they were recognized the pattern and figure out how to use the pattern, right? How to manipulate it then I start having more and more success, right? My weight start coming down things are better and like so much that came from like understanding the pattern, okay? So phase number two is like using the pattern But there's the better there's there's an X phase which is even better and I'll get that here in a second But that's that's for a lot of you get to me next phase, right? So it's like I keep trying to launch my funnel But I'm not having success. Well, why not? And I probably asked a couple questions, you know, like well, you know, I'm on my 30th try or you're like, um, I don't have an offer yet. I'm like, how long you been listening to me? I'm listening for three years for every book. I'm like, you know, I'm an offer yet that's step number one You got a great offer, right? Or it's like you get in this this learning cycle, right? It feels good to learn I see it all the time when people are like the pattern they have is like I love learning I go to seminars events listen to podcasts through the book and they think it's learning patterns They love it feels good, but they're not in a pattern to be successful. I so it's like, oh my gosh I'm in a learning pattern when I was in college or I was in high school. I used to love to learn I felt smarter. I felt like I significant spin in fact. I was smarter than other people So I love learning so I went to school went to, you know, and for some of you guys, especially you guys who are like You've got your masters and your doctorate and you're like, you're just this pattern of like, I love to learn I'm gonna I'm gonna acquire all this knowledge, but you're not in a pattern of executing getting things done, right? So you realize like the reason I'm not successful I've been stuck in this pattern and I'm this pattern because it gives me significance and happiness and all these things from back when I was in High school and then middle school and college, right? It's like I'm in the same thing now. I'm just learning and I'm learning I'm stuck in this pattern, right? Maybe it's not you baby It's like you got the thing out, but now you got the funnel live and you did all the pieces that you created it all But you're not getting traffic. It's like, why am I getting traffic? It's like, well, what's your pattern? Okay, there's a pattern that's holding you back from doing it Like what's a subconscious pattern like every day wake up and then I come in like and and what are you doing? I got it on I would ask these questions if you're out with a pattern is after you're wherever It's okay. Well the pattern to get people to come to your funnel is this right? There's two ways either free or pay if you're doing if you're doing free traffic case like you need to create a new pattern Oh, sorry, I'm and showing you guys what phase three is but basically I gotta create a new pattern And it's gonna get me the outcome right so what's the pattern? Okay? It's me my wrestling coach is they rustle you're losing because your elbows are out. Okay? What's the new pattern coming back elbows in now? I'm gonna drill and drill and drill a thousand times two thousand five thousand times this way until it becomes Subconsciously inside there and then now instinctively when it hits I the pattern is the correct pattern I go to right? So I'm I kind of skipped ahead, but phase number three for Tony is then creating a new pattern Okay, so phase one recognized in pattern phase two learning how to use those patterns to be more successful Step number three phase number three is way better, which is now creating a new pattern. Okay? You have a soul pattern. It's been great. Okay, but now you got to create a new pattern So what's the new pattern that we're consciously creating not the one that was given to us because our dad said something was or our family member Someone at school made fun of us or whatever the thing is right? It's like what's the pattern? I want to create and I consciously create this thing Okay, and this is where you know morning routines people talk about or habits like how do we make something habitual habitual habits or things That you just do over and over and over again until it becomes a pattern, right? And so the beginning though, you know, like you have these prebuilt patterns that are either helping you or holding you back Right when I get to the third phase and we create new patterns like it's coming back and say, okay I'm gonna create a pattern, but I'm doing it Consciously right and so if the very first constantly it's gonna be slower. I got to do the thing. I got to practice I got a practice again. I got a practice again. I got a practice again. I'm drilling the move drill the move, right? I'm driving to the office. I'm driving the up to eventually it like it becomes the pattern Okay, and you got to drill I think like repetition over and over like repetition is such a big part Do the repetition until it becomes a new and green pattern. Okay patterns are kind of like Ruts in a field like the about tractor right attractors out there in the field is doing the Tractoring thing and it's going through all the fields, right? Let's say the fields wet a little bit, right? So goes through and starts digging these like these ruts into the into the mud into the dirt, right? And then the the mud hardens and stuff and now these huge these huge divots these huge ruts, right? And if I'm driving a tractor, I could drive to the rivets I could jump out of it and they'll snap into those ruts, right? And it'll just fall it'll fall the pattern, right? That's what's happening our break. We've done things so many times those these ruts So for us, it's like hey if I'm gonna be successful like I can understand. Okay, here's the ruts Here's what's happening. I'm aware of it now. I'm seeing it But if I want to really be successful, I got to create the new ruts right the new pattern So I got to stop the tractor get some boards drive it out of these ruts And so okay, and what's the ruts I need it to be in to be successful and you start building it cultivating it drilling it over Over and over until the comes a new pattern, okay? And so that's the that's the key there on step number two, right is the pattern So get Tony's three phases phase numbers recognizing patterns that phase number two is using the patterns and then the best phase is moving into creating your own Patterns, right? They're gonna get you the new moves. I give you the success. Okay.

Okay, so with that said the third piece and this is the key This is the master key. Okay. I told you guys this episode. There's a master key. This is what the master key is when you understand this This is the part That is the key and I found this randomly. Yes, no Victor Frankle I wrote man search for happiness like one of the best books of all time But there's a quote and I can't remember if it came from that book or another book I bought everything he's ever written because he's amazing But there's this quote and this is the thing that unlocked everything for me. Okay, you think about patterns, right? There's usually something happens. There's like there's the stimulus and there's a response, right? And so someone hits us we get the email we see the thing on swipe Someone shoots on our legs someone like fill him like whatever that version is for you Can you get depressed you get anxiety you get fear you get whatever like there's some stimulus and then there's the response, right? And that's what happens. And so this response typically by default is going to be the pattern you've done the most right stimulus happens Boom you instantly hit into or your stimulus hits you instantly into your subconscious pattern. Okay, and so this quote Like it gave me so much freedom when I understand like again, this is the master key So this is what he said you guys ready for this? This is the writer downer already twice because it's so important Now Victor frankly said between the stimulus and the response There's a space and in that space lies our freedom and power to choose our responses in our responses lies our growth and our freedom If you just catch that catch that between the stimulus and the response, okay? So the thing happens the trigger happens your subconscious response He said between the stimulus and response. There's a space. Okay, it's a gap It's a little tiny space and it's not long. It's very very short, right? There's this gap There's a space it says in that space lies our freedom and our power to choose our response to choose the pattern we want Okay, that's the problem. Most people have they don't choose the pattern stimulus hits response boom in subconscious pattern and it's gonna either serve them or it's gonna destroy them it happens every single day a hundred times every single day or more Right, okay in that space lies our freedom and power to choose our responses in our response lies our growth And our freedom. Okay, that's the key. That's the master keys understanding that we have a choice We need to become aware of our patterns because there's gonna be a stimulus and there's gonna be response Okay, and by default you are running off of response, you know again wrestling It's me. It's my middle school thing that I drill right? I'm in a college level trying to compete all of a sudden the stimulus hits and my response is a middle school wrestling response Right the guy takes me down easily and I'm like man. I gotta work harder No, no, no, no, no work harder you have to fix the response gave the patterns incorrect Okay, perfect practice makes perfect not just practice makes perfect, right? So right now you have been living your entire life at this point practicing it perfectly Like the subconscious responses have been happening because of just life happening. You were not aware of it, right? Now you're aware of it, right? Phase number of Tony become aware of the pattern, right now the stimulus hits I'm aware. Oh my gosh. My pattern is always to do this. Okay, my pattern is when Friday happens I'm gonna go as much as possible because I feel like I just earned like free food because I've been cutting weight all week Even though I'm not cutting weight anymore, right? Stimulus response stimulus I become aware of the pattern stimulus hits I become aware of the pattern and now there's this space and the space happens and it's very short Okay, where I can go and I can figure out what is the pattern I want to? move to Okay, and then we start doing that right we build a new pattern or create a new pattern We go there over and over again until it becomes the correct response Okay, but until it does it's gonna take a while, right? You have to realize that there is a space between the stimulus response Somebody says something to you instead of responding you stop You're okay The pattern I normally go to is anger the pattern I normally go to is is fear the pattern I normally go to is tears or whatever Right, no, what's the pattern? I need to go to it's gonna give me the like what's the new ruts? I got to create what's that look like? Okay, here's the new ones. I got to create the new pattern Okay, that's how you start growing life. You guys say you're trying more success That is the master key is starting to come back in looking at this whole thing stimulus response Okay, here's the stimulus. What's the pattern that I'm responding to and so think about any area of your life You're happy with you give your finances could be your your family could be your spouse your kids could be your co-worker could be Whatever right when you start becoming hyper aware of the stimulus is they're happening, right? What is the stimulus and the stimulus happens? What's your response? Okay? I watch this all the time with coaching clients. I have a chance. I don't do a lot of I have minor circle I do one-on-one coaching with them. It's always interesting because like I'll ask them a ton of questions people You just sit there for like like there's this thing called decade and I give you 15 minutes I'll spend 10 minutes just asking questions and like why do you keep like like I really solve my problem I'm like and I keep asking questions. They're like so interesting and then I ask questions like 10 minutes or so and all I'm really doing is Trying to understand like their stimulus response like what's the pattern that they're in and I ask the question ask the questions invention I'm like, okay, these these this is the pattern you're it and Because they paid for me to coach them. I'll tell them like this is the pattern you have like you got it Like here's the tweak. This is how you change the pattern Right now every time you say that you default that you see it's not in their face Like to talk about their business They'll sigh and they'll get sad and they're like look around like I can see you like you're not gonna success in business I can see that right I see the response is happening The pattern's happening to show you up on your face and I can see it by asking a couple questions It's not as they're excited about the business, but then you ask about their team or you ask them about Traffic about whatever the thing is right and you see the they see the response this the physiological Shift in their countenance happens because of that I can stop me. Okay there like you are so happy tell me about your vision and the second I asked you about your team Everything dropped. I was like I saw the pattern, right? We got to fix that pattern if you hate your employees You got to go yeah, like there's the pattern so you got to learn how to love them or you got to get new employees Or like whatever that thing might be right or sometimes I see people who they have this response where it's like They want to grow a business, but they have paid associated with it, right? I have a friend who Man, this is probably 20 years ago He had way too much way too much success too fast and it destroyed him his life his marriage Got into drugs alcohol like lost everything and it's fascinating now He's come on the other side of that and I watch him as he as he starts new eras of his life He starts having some success and every time he gets this little glimpse of success He he just self-implodes and he doesn't understand why I keep trying to tell him like I'm like because you like and Success to ultimate failure. So you know you consciously want success your body's like last time I had success This is what happened to me, right? And so it's built patterns to make sure that you never happen that never happens you get so because that he can never have success I'm like you got to become hyper aware of that pattern, right? And then you got to go create new patterns because until you do you will never like your subconscious is moving so fast, right? 20 what I say 27,000 times faster your conscious mind as soon as you're thinking about it Sorry, not not happening like you can feel it. You can see it people can see it Externally on on you, right when you think about it when you start going towards it And so it's just such a key to start understanding those things and so think about any of your life You know happy think about this. Excuse me think about the stimulus is there happening and then the pattern that automatically responding Okay, they just come back and say look for me to be more successful Not for me to work harder or work longer hours or do anything It's me fixing the stimulus the response my system is fixing the pattern Rebuilding the pattern a new way, right? Me coming from middle school to wrestling in college Like I could put in 20 hours a day and I'm not gonna get any better because my elbows are always out because that's the pattern I drilled my entire middle school, right? I have to stop that. I have to change the pattern Give the right stance and then drill that as many times as possible till that becomes the pattern the ruts get deeper and deeper and deeper Right it moves from being conscious to subconscious now about the wrestling I don't know what's happening a shake hands everything disappears and I'm wrestling and all sudden it's like I feel like I don't even know Subconsciously 27,000 as faster subconscious in my brains like feels he moved that means his legs open boom right and like that fast Imposition shot elbow correct like boom and like it happens, right? But that's the way the game is played and it's not just athletics is in business as an entrepreneurship is in relationships is everywhere And so that is the key. That's the thing you guys have to learn and understand and master Okay, really quickly before we move on do you guys have a funnel? But it's not converting if so the problem 99% of the time is your funnel is good But you suck at selling if you want to learn how to sell so your funnels will actually convert Then get a ticket to my next selling online event by clicking on link in the description or go to selling online comm slash YouTube right now Okay, so to wrap everything up if you want to change your life the master key Okay, it's again number one you have to start becoming really really good at recognizing the patterns, right? What's the pattern? Okay number two is realizing the between the pattern or between the the stimulus and response the trigger and the pattern There's space and in that space you have the opportunity to stop and to choose the pattern you want right? It's the pattern interrupt you had to like interrupt the pattern There's some space and then from there you're rebuilding with a new pattern And you got to drill that new pattern until it becomes second nature until it becomes the default Becomes the response and when you do that then when life comes at you business personality whatever like Like you've created the correct pattern that's gonna take you to the result you want and that's literally the key So fascinating for years my life. I've tried so much to like outwork it out do they and like there's there's a lot that goes to Hard work right hard work is good at helping you build the habits and the things I have some not against hard work I love hard work probably more than most people But what's crazy is like instead of like trying to push a car up a hill or someone inside Is that foot on the break if I can stop like take the foot off the break and like fix things You know change the pattern then it becomes really simple and really easy And so yeah that's what I want to share with you. I hope it was helpful for you It's fun for me to talk about this kind of stuff because most of them are talking about business It's like the reality is like the squeeze page and things holding you back It's your ability or your willingness to follow like to to get out of a pattern is holding you back and get the right pattern Like that's really like the bulk of what I do with people and I have a chance to work one-on-one with them It's less about the tactics because the tactics of business is actually pretty easy The hardest thing is like recognizing and rebuilding your patterns They'll allow you to actually execute the game plan game plan simple. I read about all my books You've got any of them you got dot com secrets expert secret. You have all the books. You've got the plans It's just your response when the thing hits you okay Was Mike Mike Tyson say everybody's got a plan so you hit the face right you have a plan Consciously and he hit the face your subconscious takes over and depending on how you've trained that depending on the patterns You have consciously built you correctly response to the punch in the face is how the success looks on the other side of it So that's that hope that helps. Thank you guys so much for listening to the show. I appreciate you all Thank you for allowing me to serve you guys. I love it. I love you.
