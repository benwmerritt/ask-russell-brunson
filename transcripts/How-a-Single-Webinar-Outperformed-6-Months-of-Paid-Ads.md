How would you like to get 90% of people to show up to your challenges or your webinars? Now it may sound kind of crazy, but I'm walking you through six steps to actually make that happen. The secret behind this is instead of just creating a challenge or a webinar, you'd actually craft an engineer what's called a dramatic demonstration. In fact, I'm going to show you behind the scenes today, a dramatic demonstration that we did where we literally got more people to join a continuity program in 15 minutes than we had six months prior with some paid ads. This year's funnel hacking, I have one of our speaker's names Tim Shields and Tim is in the photography industry and it's interesting to me because he does all of his business through webinars, but he doesn't do boring webinars. He creates these dramatic demonstrations. So for example, what he does instead of being in his house in his office like, Hey, welcome to my webinar today. He literally went to the side of the Grand Canyon, set up Starlink and did an entire webinar, teach people how to landscape photography, again, not from his home, but at this amazing location, right? Then he took them to Bamford, one of the most beautiful places on the earth. Same thing, set the cameras, brought Starlink in and did his webinar from there. And so while he was on stage, funnel hacking, I talked about this, the key with the dramatic demonstrations is that you got to take your audience somewhere they would want to go, but they don't have access to. And he looked directly at me and said, Russell, for your audience, you should take them to Dan Kennedy's basement. And for me, that was interesting because Dan Kennedy's basement, when I first got into the marketing world, I heard rumors of people who had paid Dan Kennedy for a private console day. And as a young entrepreneur, I was like someday I want to pay Dan to go to his base. I want to do that. And last year, actually, the very first chance to do, I paid him for a console day, and I went to his basement and did the one day console and it changed my life. It was the most amazing, cool experiences I've ever had. And so when Tim said that from States at Russell, you should take people to Dan Kennedy's basement. I was like, oh my gosh, that's brilliant. And then the will started spinning my head because he took people to the site of Dan Kenyon and had to bring Starlink in because there's no internet. And the most fascinating thing about Dan Kennedy, if you know who he is, he is the greatest marketing legend of all time, but he doesn't have internet as home. We still have to fax Dan Kennedy. And so how cool that people went to Dan Kennedy's basement and we brought Starlink there and streamed the internet. So the first time in the history of all time, we could stream from Dan Kennedy's basement and start planning it. And I thought, I should probably ask Dan Kennedy if he's okay with me bringing the internet to his basement. I wrote up a letter, I faxed it to him, asked him if he'd be willing to allow me to do a dramatic demonstration in his basement. And luckily for me, a few days later when the fax came back, it said yes. All right. So with that set up, I'm walking through the six steps that we did actually execute on this dramatic demonstration. These are the same six steps you should model as you're creating and crafting yours. So the first step is we needed a hook. The hook is what drives the entire dramatic demonstration, right? Be saying, I'm going to go get a console, Dave, Dan Kennedy's a good hook, but a better hook is, Hey, I bought a one day console with Dan Kennedy and flying to his basement. The internet's never been there in history of all time. I'm bringing Starlink in and we're going to be streaming from his basement. Those hooks are both similar, but that one's so much stronger. So it's creating a hook that causes intrigue and excitement. And then number two is I had to have a story behind us. What was the story like? Why was I going to Dan Kennedy's basement? Now the reality is Dan had actually faxed me saying that we should do a consultation about the continuity program, about our membership site and how to increase stick rates and things like that. I needed to embellish the story, make it better. So what I did is I jumped online and actually bought a fax machine. And then we took the fax that Dan had actually sent me and then we refax it to myself so that I could actually get the fax on the video. So it's all about finding a really good hook, telling a good story. So that's step number one. All right. Step number two now is we need to create a landing page based on this hook. So that was when I do start promoting this, people can register to be part of the event. It's a very simple like one page site. They just get somebody intrigued enough that they're going to give us their contact information to register for the dramatic demonstration. And one of the keys on a registration page is if you tell everybody exactly what's going to happen, they may register, but the show up rate will be very, very low. The number one thing you have on a landing page to increase conversions of people registering and actually showing up is curiosity. The more curiosity you give them, the more likely they are to show up. All right. Step number three now is you need to create little mini dramatic demonstrations to get people to actually register for the big dramatic demonstration. I need to create a bunch of fun and buzz and excitement around the actual advertising campaign. So the first thing we did is we took that fax machine we bought and we filmed a whole bunch of ads with me and the fax machine. He literally faxes me things because this is his version of email. We created ads for YouTube, for social, horizontal ads, vertical ads, swipe up ads, all the type of ads possible. After we created a whole bunch of ads based on hook around the fax machine, I thought what other hooks can we use to get people excited about coming to this dramatic demonstration? So number two was we have the mascot of Bruno, the bull whose Dan Kennedy is mascot. And so we got the big bullhead and made a whole bunch of videos and he's stuff is going to grab their attention. Right? Just long enough, I can tell them the story about Dan Kennedy to get them to register for the main dramatic demonstration. Step number four, after we've created all these different ads, now we need to promote these ads. The very first thing we need to promote is we focus on our best traffic, which is our own list, right? So we send emails out to Dan Kennedy's list. Number two, the second best thing now is taking all these ad creatives and post them on your social for free. Everywhere we have a presence, everywhere we're following, posting these fun viral ads, now we're going to go start buying ads. We asked other people who love Dan Kennedy to also promote this dramatic demonstration and we're lucky we had a whole handful of really good affiliates who also promote as well. Now by following these four steps to get traffic, we ended up getting 10,237 people to register. Now step number five, this is where I have to actually perform the dramatic demonstration. I pack my bags and I race the airport. But before I did, I swung by the office really quick, grabbed on my phone, I started doing a bunch of Facebook lives, Instagram lives, telling people I was about to go see the Wizard of Oz. I'm about to go see Dan Kennedy's house. What's up everybody? This is Russell and right now I'm about to jump on a plane to fly to Cleveland, Ohio to go to Dan Kennedy's house. If you haven't registered yet, you got one last chance. If you have registered, like get ready because tomorrow morning we're going live. We're going to wake up early next morning and we drove to Dan Kennedy's house and we had to go set up Starlink. And once again, the internet has never been in the basement. This was the very first time. Dan Kennedy, who's written like 40 best-selling books has never been on Amazon.com. The internet is in Dan Kennedy's basement for the first time ever. Then we started letting everybody know. This is about 15 and 20 minutes before the dramatic demonstration happened. We started messaging everyone on email, everyone who's registered, hey, we're going live. Dan Kennedy's basement on Facebook, on Instagram, everywhere we're going, like we're going live, we're going live, we're going live. And from that, we normally give out 20 to 25% of people to show up for a webinar. We had over 70% of people who showed up and stayed on for the entire event. He showed us everything and people had a chance to actually see where Dan Kennedy worked. People in the comments were freaking out because they've heard legends of Dan Kennedy, heard legends of this basement. That's why people showed up. They showed up because they wanted this experience. They couldn't get any other time, any other spot. Step number six, now, Wonder Mag demonstration leads to another. So what happens after we do the tour of Dan's house and they had a chance to see everything and we sat down and we did a 45 minute training with Dan Kennedy. How's it going everybody? Welcome to today's live presentation right now. As you can see, we're in the basement of Dan Kennedy. The goal of this training was to have Dan Kennedy teach two of the most powerful strategies if you're running a membership site or continuity program. Number one was how to get new members coming in and number two was how to get people to stick. So he taught for 45 minutes on those topics, focusing primarily on the what? What do you actually do? When the 45 minutes was up, then basically we told everybody who was on the live stream said, okay, this has been amazing. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Hopefully you enjoyed seeing Dan's house. Hope you got some really good value from the content Dan shared so far. But for all of you guys who are active members of the membership site, in 15 minutes at the top of the hour, we're going to be going live. We're going to film for about three hours talking through, first off, how to go deep into the actual tactics of the first two strategies Dan shared. At the top of that, you're going to share three more ways to get new members and three more ways to get members to stick. It's going to be amazing, but only if you're an active member. So if you're an active member, log the membership site right now. There's a link inside there. Go and create your account and jump on live training. It's going to be starting in 15 minutes. And if you're not a member yet, now is the time. You got to be a member. So if you're not a member yet, this is the time to come and jump in here. And then we ended the live stream and we sat there for a minute. And during that time, we started watching the sales coming in. It was crazy. We're going to be getting more thousand members to sign up during that little 15 minute window of time to get on the live stream for the second dramatic demonstration to be happening, which was a three hour master class with Dan Kennedy. We're going live with Dan to go deeper in this conversation, to go through a lot more stuff for a couple hours. It was crazy about that to me. For us to get a thousand members into a membership site, traditionally, if we were buying ads every single day, it would have cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars, first off, to do that. But number two, it would have taken us probably six to eight months to get that many members to do a membership site. Instead, we did it with one dramatic demonstration in just 15 short minutes, which is crazy. Now, if you guys want to see a replay of the first dramatic demonstration in Dan's basement, you want to see the tour of everything, we'll throw a link down in the description down below where you can go and check it out. Plus, you get some really powerful stuff to show you exactly how to get more people to join your membership sites and get them to stick longer. So I hope that helps you guys thanks so much.
