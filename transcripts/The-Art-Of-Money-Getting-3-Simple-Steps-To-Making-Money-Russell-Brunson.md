For you to make a million dollars, the amount of people's lives you have to change in the pursuit of that goal is the key. That's what is exciting for me. For those who don't know me, I collect old books. I was reading through the art of money getting from 1840s and then P.T. Barnum's version from 1880s and I was like, what's my version? What's the art of money getting looked like today? So I want to walk you through my process in this century on the art of money getting. I want you to understand that when we talk about the art of money getting, I'm not talking about money getting like going to the bank and trying to get money from them. I'm a big fan of money. That's where you come in. Money is not a byproduct of anything else besides value. If you want to have money and have wealth and have all these kind of things, it all comes down to you producing more than you're consuming. It's like losing weight. I have to burn more calories than I consume. If I do that, then I lose weight. Right? Same thing is true in business. If you want to make more money, you have to produce more value than you are consuming and by doing that, that's how you become rich. That's how you become wealthy. Now for me, when I'm looking at how do I create value for something, it's always tied back to something very specific and very tangible. It's what we call an offer. One of the biggest problems people have when they're trying to master the art of money getting is they're going out there and they are creating a product. The problem with a product is that a lot of people can have the exact same product. Well, five people are selling the same thing, then the person with the cheapest product is the one who actually wins. My mentor, Dan Kennedy, used to say, there's no strategic advantage of being the second lowest price leader in town. So instead of trying to decrease the price to increase the value, instead of we add value, so we offer stack. If you ever see me do a presentation and I make an offer, I'm always like, you know, the first thing I'm going to sell, here's the course or the mastermind or the seminar and then I start adding other bonuses. The goal of the bonuses is to make the offer unique to me so that I'm not competing against anybody else. And number two, it's to increase the value. A good example of this on our speaking events, I was trying to explain this concept to everybody about how they can increase the value of anything that they're selling. And I pulled my phone on my pocket and I said, okay, this phone right here, you can buy these at Best Buy, Walmart, online, anywhere for like 800 bucks a piece, right? Who here gave me $800 for it? And there's like two people's hands went up. I was like, what if I sold this to you for $500? But I undercut everybody else and people's hands started going, I'll buy it for $500. And I'm like, hey, see, that's the problem. This is where most people are trying to create values by decreasing the price and like it never works that way. And I said, let me show you guys a magic trick. I said, I'm going to show you how I can increase the value of this phone right here. The value of this phone isn't just in the hardware, it's in all the stuff inside this phone you can't get anywhere else. Over the last decade of my life, I have bought in every single course on business, marketing, sales, and personal development on the planet. On the low end, I've spent about $500,000 on courses and programs. I've got a pretty extensive role there. I actually have access to every connection I've ever built up over the last 20 years of my business. And then I started going through every single app, saying all the things on this phone. I said, how many of you guys here would be willing to spend $10,000 on my phone right now? I'm like, three forces out of each other's hands went up. Am I cool? Who do it for $20,000? $30,000. $40,000. It's a couple of hands that drop in $50,000. $60,000. $80,000. And by the time you get to about $500,000, you're still three people's hands up. And I asked one guy, I said, why would you do that? And you grab the microphone and he said, because based on all the value inside that phone, that actually seems really, really cheap. If you increase the value of the offer so much to look at that and say, wow, that seems really, really cheap, then it's a no-brainer. That becomes really, really easy to get somebody to buy the thing from you. So the first step in money-getting is figuring out how to create an offer. Now, if you look at me when I speak at seminars or on stages and if I'm making an offer stack of all things, I don't just go like, first thing you're going to get is this, and then you're going to get this, and then you're going to get this. Every time I introduce a new piece of the offer, I tell the story about it. If I was to try to sell this book right now, I'm like, hey, do you want to buy a book on the art of money-getting? You'd be like, sure how much? I'm like, $3,500. You're like, $3,500? That seems insane, right? I'd never pay $3,500. Now, let's come back in time. I want to tell you a story, guys. I've been buying old books that are in what's called the public domain, which means that I'm going to publish them and I can sell them as my own. I make my own derivative works. I might teach a course from the information from the book, and I do that and I can sell these things. In fact, recently I bought a book for $1.5 million, which seems like a lot of money. Rusty spent so much money on this old book set, but it was the original pre-first edition copy of Napoleon Hill's Laws of Success. I turned it into an audiobook. I turned it into a course. We launched that, and during the launch week, it made over $2 million from the launch itself. So I spent $1.5 million. I made $2 million back, and now I have an asset I can sell over and over and over again. I keep 100% of the money. What's fascinating is I was trying to find what's the first book ever written on how to make money online. The very first book I ever found is called The Art of Money-Getting, which was written in 1849. I've not found any other copies, but if you went and attached a course to it, this is an easy $300 to $500 course, and you could probably sell 1,000 copies in the next year. How many of you guys would be interested in buying the only copy of this? You could be the only person in the world who could do an actual course on The Art of Money-Getting. If so, it's $3,500 for this book. You have to learn how to tell a story about each of the elements inside of your offer. The reason why we do that is because a story will increase the perceived value of the thing that you're trying to sell. If you really want to master the art of money-getting, it's all about speed. How do you increase the speed of you making money? The best way I know it increases speed is transitioning from one-on-one sales to one-to-many sales. Even guys like P.T. Barnum, who was America's second millionaire, do you know that? In fact, we gave him an honorary two-comical award at one of our recent funnel hacking lives. If you look at what he did, he wasn't just going out and doing one sales at a time. He was like, let me gather the many, bring him to a circus or to an event, and then from there he would sell them. For me, we do this typically through live events, through webinars, through tell seminars, through videos, where I'm not speaking one-on-one with people. Instead, I'm speaking one-to-many. In the presentation, I'm going to craft it in a way that tells the stories about the offers. It provides value to people upfront, and then from there I can make the special offer to them. It's creating an offer. You're learning how to tell stories in a way that increases the perceived value of that offer to make it feel cheap, make it feel inexpensive. And number three is making a presentation. Gathering the many so you can do a one-to-many presentation so that every time you make a sale instead of making one sale, you make 10, 20, 30 sales, which speeds up your ability to gather money faster. I hope this is helpful for you guys and gives you guys some of the frameworks of what we use to get money into our businesses, into our pockets. It's the same thing you should be doing as well. I hope you enjoyed this video. If you did, let me know in the comments down below. Let me know if you guys have any other old books that you're interested in that I could look at and I could read. Again, I'm a collector. I've been collecting old books for now for the last couple of years. I've obsessed with them and the art of money getting by both P.T. Barnum and Lehman Thomas Reed. Two great books. They're even more applicable today than ever. And I hope you guys enjoyed this video. With that said, thank you so much. And we'll see you all in the next video.
