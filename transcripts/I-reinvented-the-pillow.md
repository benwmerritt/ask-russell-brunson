This new technology lets you read in your sleep. Invented by ClickFunnels founder Russell Brunson, these pillows use frequency-assisted kinetic energy to transmit words directly into your brain while you are sleeping. So a lot of people want to read my books because they want to learn how to build a funnel or tell their story or learn how to drive traffic. But what we found is that even though they want to read my books, they suck at reading. So after building a $100 million software company, Russell decided to disrupt another industry. Entrepreneurs believe they should be making money while they're sleeping, right? But we thought, what if you could learn how to make money while you're sleeping? That's why we reinvented the pillow. Let me show you how it works. The way it works is it senses when you're asleep and then it sends frequencies into your brain which translates into words. And yes, it comes in every language. My favorite part is that when I finish a chapter, the pillow sends a painless shock of electricity so that I wake up and implement everything that I've learned right away. I tried every pillow out there and all they did was help me to sleep. What a waste of time. As an entrepreneur, I always feel unproductive when I sleep, but now I'm learning how to post a profitable webinar, build my social media following, and I only occasionally have nightmares of a zombie Russell Brunson trying to eat my face. Yeah, so we are still beta testing a new feature. When you enter REM sleep, we're actually overrides your dreams and you hear me reading the book to you. No, no, it's not weird at all.
