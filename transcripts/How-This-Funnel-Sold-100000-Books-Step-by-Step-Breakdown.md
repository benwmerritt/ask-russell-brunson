## Transcript
Hey, this is Russell and during this video, I'm going to show you guys the funnel that I used to sell over 100,000 copies of my best selling book called Expert Secrets. I'm going to show you everything. I'll show you behind the scenes of what the funnel does, how it works. I'm going to show you the upsells, the downsells. I'm also going to show you guys all the ads we use to drive people into the funnel and buy the books. And then at the end of the video, I'm actually going to give you screenshots of every single page inside this funnel so you can use it as you're building out your next funnel. This funnel helped me sell over 100,000 copies of this book and it's based on a simple funnel that anyone could use even you. Okay, to begin with, before I dive into the actual funnel pages, the first thing in any funnel is how do you get somebody into the funnel? And if you've read any of my books, I always share my favorite framework, which is Hook's story offer. That's how we get somebody's attention. You think about this, people are online, they're on social media, they're on their phones, sitting on the couch, on the toilet, scrolling all day, they're scrolling, scrolling. And our job as marketers is to first off to throw out a hook, to grab their attention just so that they stop scrolling. Like what is that? Right? It's the first step is hook, and then they click on the button and then they get to hear you tell a story. Right? And the goal of the story is to increase the perceived value of the thing you're going to offer. So Hook's story offer. So before we dive into the actual funnel, I walk you through all the steps inside the funnel pages. I want to show you a couple of the ads that we created to go that serve those hooks to grab somebody's attention initially. Okay? And so for us, we're testing all sorts of hooks all the time. Right? We're always creating different ads and things like that. And the first one I show you is an ad right here at the top. You can see this is where I took the expert secrets book and I dumped gasoline on it and I lit it on fire. My thought was like if someone's scrolling on their phone, just you know, do them scrolling, I'll say, see like me burning a book, they're going to stop for a second, right? So that's why I created this very first ad right here. So I'm going to play just part of it. I won't show the whole thing, but when you see part of it, so you can see the framework. Notice how you hook story offer the very first 20 seconds of the video to grab their attention, quickly tell them a story and then to make them an offer. Check this out. Literally on fire. I'm hoping it doesn't catch me on fire. It's my brand new book called Expert Secrets to Teach You How to Find Your Voice, How to Share Your Advice and Actually Make Money Doing It. And right now, if you go to amazon.com, you can get a copy of this book for 20 bucks and you see all the five star reviews or you get a free copy going to expertsseacres.com. Literally, this book is on fire. Okay, notice hook story offer all delivered in the first like 15, 20 seconds. And then from there, I kind of tell some more stories like keep iterating, keep pushing back to the thing, but I'm trying to grab their attention very, very quickly. So that was one example of an ad we put out there to grab somebody to bring them into our funnel. This ad alone sold tens of thousands of copies of the expert secrets book, right? And I'm always looking for different ads. I can use different hooks to grab someone's attention. So these other ones, I'm not going to show you the whole videos, but this one right here, I was actually in Amsterdam and we're walking down the street and we saw this inside of the hotel lobby, this big green rhino. And I was like, that's a hook. That's going to grab someone's attention. So we grabbed the book, stood in front of the rhino, told them a story, hooked story offer, told them to get a free copy of the book and boom, this one sold again, tens of thousands of copies were sold because of this green rhino inside of just a hotel lobby. Okay. Another one here inside of my book, expert secrets to talk about how we, my very first product ever was potato gun. So I grabbed a potato gun and I shot this thing and like that was a hook and I can tell him a story and they made an offer free copy of the book. This one I went and hung myself from the ceiling, which was ridiculous. But again, I want to try to grab somebody's attention, grab them really quickly and then stop, stop them, tell them a story and then make them an offer. And it's last right here on the side. You can see this was, this kid I met on a TikTok, he was blowing up watermelons all day long and I was like, this is a great hook. So I paid him a couple thousand bucks to go and like basically take a watermelon and my book and see which one would explode first. And we use that, boom, hook story offer dropped out there and became an ad that drove people into the funnel. So these are examples of ads we use to get somebody's attention, to get them to click on a link to show up to our funnel. Now let me show you guys each of the pages and each of the steps here inside of the actual expert secrets funnel. All right. Now this is the first page here inside the expert secrets funnel. Yeah. After you would click on the ads, this is the page you would land on. And there's a whole bunch of stuff I do on this landing page that you may have seen my pages before. I'm like, oh yeah, like that's really cool. But there's so many little tiny intricacies of things we're testing and tweaking. And I want to make sure you don't miss this. I'm going to walk you through some of the core most important things. But before we do the answer is yes, this page was built in ClickFunnels because as you know, friends don't let friends not build funnels inside of ClickFunnels. Now obviously if you want to sell stuff online, you're going to need a good funnel. But if you want a great funnel, then you need to use ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels is the number one funnel builder in the world, helping more first time entrepreneurs to leave their nine to five and to launch their dreams in any other company in the world. ClickFunnels was built for the dreamers and the doers. And you can get a free 14 day trial right now by going to clickfunnels.com slash YouTube or by clicking on link in the description right now. ClickFunnels because you're one funnel away from changing the world. If you haven't used the new ClickFunnels recently, this is what it looks like behind the scenes. This is what the actual funnel pages here look like inside the Expert Secrets funnel. So I'll kind of take you down through this. I reset the stats before making this video. Just so you guys wouldn't see exactly what our stats are right now. But check that you can see this is when someone comes down and someone comes to expertssecrets.com, they get split tests between the two pages. Now these two pages are identical, but we're split testing two different videos right now. So that's the only difference between these two pages. When we find out what video out converts, then we'll split test different headlines. We'll split test different button colors, things like that. We're always, we always have a split test happening. And the reason why is I have a mantra here inside of a company that basically says give yourself a raise every single day. In fact, everyone of you guys, that should be your mantra. Every evening you come to the office, how do I give myself a raise today? How do I give myself a raise today? And you do that by simple split testing day in and day out. And by doing that, the pages get better and better over time. Okay. That's why my funnels convert so well is that I've been literally doing split tests now for 20 years. So when I create a new funnel, I'm not guessing, I'm starting with, with the framework, what we know works best, and then I'm always iterating on top of that and on top of that. And when we find winners, we take them back through our other funnels and kind of go back through and add those updates to the other funnels that we're running. And so that's kind of what's happening. So this is the very first homepage. Again, we're split testing two different pages from there. After somebody buys, it takes them down to upsell number one. And I'll walk you through that page here in a second. After they buy that, takes it upsell number two. And then depending if they buy it, that they don't purchase it, this is the down sell. If they do purchase it, then we have a VIP upsell. And from there, we take them to thank you page. And we have two different thank you pages based on if they did buy upsell one, or if they didn't, excuse me, upsell two, because if they didn't, then we try to upsell them again on the thank you page. So that's what the funnel structure looks like. It's kind of cool for those who are not seeing the new click funnels. It's really neat the way that the funnels are set up and you kind of see these and you can go and edit page by page and everything. So, but with that said, let me jump into the very first page. So again, this is the homepage of the expert secrets book funnel. And again, some of the core things that people mess up, mess up on. And I see this all the time and something like looks at one of my pages, looks at one of our funnels and try to model it. Like there's a couple of things I'm doing. And you notice that there's another framework I teach actually inside of expert secrets. I talk about this concept of the best way to sell somebody is first emotion, then logic and fear, right? So motion, logic, fear. And so when I'm creating a page, my first best shot is emotion. So you notice like a front headline, right? It's very affirmational, like get your free copy of expert secrets. It's going to show you how to find your message, build a tribe and change the world. Okay, and then I have a video here that's very emotional is going to grab their attention. And then above the fold, I've got them starting right here into the order process. Okay. And so everything above the fold, I'm using emotion to sell something, right? Now, if someone doesn't buy it during the first pass, then what happens is, and again, if you look at a few heat maps, we do heat maps on all of our pages, right? Like 60, 56% of people will buy without ever scrolling past here. Okay. The people that are scrolling down are your logical buyers. Like they need more proof. So I move from emotion and they come down here. If you notice down here transitions, now I start speaking logically to people. Okay, logic. I'm using logic and words and bullet points and features and benefits and testimonies. I'm speaking logically to convince people that what they're trying to buy is the right thing, right? Then boom, make the offer again. I come back, here's more logic. Here's what you're going to learn about. Boom. I go through the book and I literally go secret by secret, you know, chapter by chapter, I pull out one big nugget. So it's like, you know, here's in chapter number one, which my books, I call them secrets, but here's secret number one, secret two, secret thing. I'm pulling out one big nugget. I see them see one bullet point logically, they, oh, I need that. I got to buy it, right? So I have all these different bullet points. Okay. So each chapter, I pull one bullet point out to get them to be like, man, if I just had that one secret, that one idea, it would be worth the book in and of itself, right? So I'm going to take them through there, boom, put the offer out again. Then I come back, now I need bonuses, right? Again, logical buyers, that like, even though it's a free book, they're paying shipping handling, I'm still going to make this offer as insane as possible. So not only did they get the book, they also get the expert evolution training, which is the $100 value, $97 value. They get the hook story offer training for $97 value. They get the perfect webinar slides, $197 value. They get the five minute perfect webinar, $97 value. They get the 30 day challenge. So like, I'm making this offer more and more irresistible, right? Okay. So there's emotion, logic, and now I'm going to transition the last part of the page to fear. Okay. Fear is giving them urgency and scarcity to buy now. Okay. So let's start coming out here and start introducing fear. So emotion, logic, here comes fear. There's no catch. Talk about that, but time is of the essence. You got to guarantee, you got to buy this thing now. There's a recap of everything inside the offer. Boom. And then they can reserve that copy. Okay. And then always have a PS, a lot of people scroll the PS and start to recap the entire offer back here inside of the PS, right? So it says, I'm going to mail you a 355 page hardcover book, expert secrets, plus all these bonuses. Normally it's 2495. If you go to Amazon, but you get it for free, just cover shipping handling, boom, boom, boom. And there's a recap of the thing. And then another button down here to the offer. Okay. And then we also recently all of our funnels have been adding these frequently asked question sections and these work really, really good as well. So we had FAQs. Okay. That said, I'm going to scroll back up to the above the fold because most of the heavy lifting in a page is going to have on a funnel is going to happen above the fold. In fact, if, if you don't want to write long form cells there, if you just have a headline video and the two step order form and like it just ends right there, again, most of your conversions will come from the emotional buyers above the fold. So this is the most important spot. This is where you do all the split testing and the headline tweaks and the colors and the buttons and everything. Okay. Now, of all the things I've been walking through, some of the things that have had the biggest impact on conversion force. Okay. One of these I learned from one of my inner circle members back in the day, they added this block above the two step order form that talks about the speed of shipping. Okay. And so notice, get your free copy of expert secret shipped to you in less than seven days. That little dorky, like little banner ad will dramatically increase your conversions. That alone, like we worth tens of thousands of dollars to you if you add that to the beget to above any of your two step order forms. Do you have a funnel, but it's not converting the problem 99.9% of the time is that your funnel is good, but you suck at selling. If you want to learn how to sell so your phones will actually convert, then get a ticket to my next selling online event by clicking on the link in the description or go to selling online.com slash YouTube right now. Okay. Number two, you come down to step order form. The copy in these two little buttons actually matters a lot. Okay. By default and click funnels, you'll have something else, you know, it's like step one, step two, we shifted it to like, to ask them the question, shipping, where should we ship it to? Oh, here's the shipping information. Okay. Upgrade now and save. So it's not saying info billing, right? Like we're using good copy to get them to actually fill this out. So where do you want to ship it to right here? Okay. Cool. You want to upgrade now and save. Here's upgrade option, which is an order form bump, right? So that's all in here. The other thing we do, you'll notice is below this button, we do free plus shipping offers, like book funnels and things like that. One of the big problems people have is always like, I thought you said it was free and they, they, we always got so much flack from people and like so much, it was very, very frustrating. We started adding this down below, which is just basically expert secrets, retails for 20 bucks, but we bought it for you. All you do is pay shipping handling. So by adding this in here, it cut those complaints down to like, to like 1%, right? Like most of the people, that filter them out. Okay. A couple of other things you never want whites, like blank whitespace. Whenever there's whitespace, always throw a testimonial. Okay. This page had a big white block down here. I'm like, Oh, throwing testimonial. I always put testimonial, whatever there's whitespace. We've done countless tests about that. It always increases conversions. Also, you notice I'm trying to get everything to be, to the transition to the order form. So down below the video, there's this thing, but it's always pushing everyone's eyeballs through the arrow, pushing them across to see the order button. Okay. So momentum and movement of eyes towards where you want somebody to actually do. Back in day, we worked with a, a pet insurance company and we did this split test with this dog on the landing page and we had a dog looking at the camera, a dog looking away from the order form button, then a dog whose nose is faced towards it and by the dogs, by the dogs nose facing towards the order button. So it was like driving the eyes towards the order button. It like three X conversions on the sales page. It was crazy. So that's why we have these arrows pushing people over here to get their eyeball moving over here to go and fill out the form. Okay. All right. So that is the first part about this funnel. Now, a couple of things I want to show you is that are really powerful. Okay. This is especially powerful for you're doing a book funnel because obviously ideally I want people to buy through this funnel because I'm going to be able to maximize my EPCs, which is my, my earnings per click or my average order value. I want to try to get that value as much as possible. And that's when the funnel is so powerful, but some people will never buy through a funnel. Right. How many of you guys know like, if I'm going to buy a book, I'm not buying through, I'm not going to buy through a funnel. I'm going to buy through Amazon. Okay. The reality is a percentage of your people are always going to get. So what we do is like when they start trying to leave, boom, we exit pop up here. It says, Hey, you could also order expert seekers from Amazon and other books down below. And we give them a link to directly to Amazon, Amazon Kindle and Audible. They click on that. You'll notice it just opens up Amazon. And boom, it shows right there. And so you notice like right now we've sold, we've sold a lot more, but 2100 people left reviews just from our exit pop, right? They came over here. They saw this and they bought the book. So we exit pop this. Now a couple of cool things. These are little ninja secrets. One of them is that all of these are my affiliate links. So if I click on that, as the author, I get my royalties, which is great. But now I'm an affiliate. So I also get double royalties. But then the other really cool thing about this is if someone clicks on your affiliate link and anything else they buy for the next 24 hours, you get paid commissions on that. So someone comes here on Amazon, they buy expert secrets, buy the audio book, or they buy the regular book, whatever. That's pretty cool, right? But if they go and they buy a new desk or they buy a new lamp or they go buy food or whatever they'll say, buy an Amazon for the next 24 hours, I get paid commissions on it. So this is like this free way to get more book sales, but also more recurring revenue on the back end over the next 24 hours, everything else they're buying. So that's one of the secrets a lot of people know about. That's just huge for you because there's a percentage of people who will not buy through a funnel and they want to go through a traditional seller like Amazon. And so that's what we do. We first found this out with one of our supplement companies. We were selling a diabetic neuropathy supplement and there was just a segment of our audience. They were, most of our audience was older and they would not buy online. But if we pushed into Amazon or we pushed them to a phone number, they would go and they would buy because they felt more comfortable. And so we do the same thing here. I don't want people to not buy the book, right? So if they, if not going to go through the funnel, okay, last pass out, ship them out to Amazon, Amazon, Kindle, or Audible, let them buy through those resources as well. After I fill out that form, it takes me to this two step order form, right? So separate from one, ask where do you want to ship the book? And step number two is now we get their credit card information to pay for shipping. Now a couple of cool things happen here. Okay. There's a big percentage of people who fill out step number one, but they don't fill out step number two. And you have the ability now to follow up those people and send them emails. Okay. Inside of ClickFunnels, basically when you come back here inside the funnel, you can set up these, you click on some lightning bolt and you can set up workflows and a workflow will basically set up a whole email sequence. I don't have one live in here right now. But basically it says like, if they fill out step one, but not step number two, send them out email. So for example, we'll do is three hours later, like, Hey, did you forget to finish the card sequence? Like you didn't finish filling out the card and you have a whole sequence for those who don't fill out step number one, getting them back to fill out step number two. Okay. And so what's really cool about this is that these two step order forms, even if people don't buy, they get out of your email list and it starts growing your list very, very quickly. In fact, man, I've added literally millions of people on my list who never bought the expert secrets book, but they filled out step number one and not step number two. So again, we have a follow up sequence, try to push them back to finish out step number two. But on top of that, we have those people to our email list and then we can sell them other products and services down the line, which is really cool. Okay. All right. And you come down here, you scroll down, obviously there's the book shipping rate, they pin their credit card. And then this is the big secret between the credit card and the order button is where you slip in what's called an order form bump. And an order form bump is kind of like when you're at the grocery store and you got to check out your, you got all your groceries in the bag and you're walking through and you're about to check out and you look over the side, right? Oh, I want some tic-tacs. I want a national acquired magazine. Like just think no brainer offers that they grab really quickly and throw in their cart. Those, those are order form bumps. And it was crazy if you look at like where grocery stores make the majority of their money, they make most of their money. Like the profit comes in the checkout stand. Same thing is true here. Like a lot of times the money that makes, that we make right here through order form bumps covers all of our ad costs, which is crazy. Okay. So right now I have two order form bumps. I've got the audio book for 37 bucks. Someone clicks on here and gets some, gives them more info, but it gives them the core thing they need to click there and add it to their order. And they also have a $97 upsell right here, which is the live event. And they can add those things right there. Okay. So two really quick things they can add to the order. Again, it increases the average order value or the average cart value to get people spending more money every time they buy a book, which gives you the ability to spend more money on advertising, right? And they fill it out, boom, they buy this, and that's step number one in the funnel. Okay. All right. So come back here. Now you guys have seen the first two, the first page in the funnel. Again, we're split testing different videos right now, but that's one thing that's different. Now, after we buy this, we take them out upsell number one. Okay. So this is upsell page number one. Now, there's a lot of really important things that are happening on this page, but the number one most important thing you need to remember and understand is that the goal of the upsell page is to keep the buying loop open in their minds, not closing it. So keeping it open and then making a very special offer. Okay. Now, what's cool about this is the first thing you're selling. So for me, example, the books, the first thing I'm selling, this is the hardest thing to sell. Okay. Cause someone's got to go and they got to run around, they got to go, the house find their wallet, get their credit card out, pull it out, go and buy it. Like that's the hardest sell. Now all the upsells are much, much easier because they've already said yes. They've already committed to like, okay, I'm buying expert secrets. I want to learn how to become an expert. Right. So everything else moving forward now is just a slippery slope of like, would you all like this? Would you all like this? Like they're simpler sales. Right. So the first step on this page is to keep the buying loop open. So notice a couple of things. I'm not saying congratulations. Your order is complete. Can't say congratulations for your book, but don't click back or exit right now. Okay. We have a very important upgrade right now. Upgrade your orders. This is special offers only available right here right now. And so I have this very like, I'm keeping the buying loop open. Okay. So that's the number one thing to understand. Okay. So you come down here, you notice I'm trying to get them to watch the video. So like literally it's like all these things before you go to members area, watch this video, watch this video. It's like four or five things. My entire goal of this is to get people to watch the video. Okay. If you watch the video, a couple of things you're noticed. Number one is I'm going to acknowledge the thing that they just bought. And then from there, talking about we can upgrade that order with something else. So check this out. Hey, this is Russell. And first off, thank you so much for getting your copy of the expert secrets book. I cannot wait to send this out to you. This book has the ability to change your life. If you're here and you got this book, it means you are someone who's an expert who wants to figure out how to sell their advice, how to make more money by talking and speaking and creating products and services. And this book is going to teach you all of that. It can help you to figure out how to build a following of people who are going to follow you and then you can change their lives. Going through this process and first thing I did acknowledge their purpose, their purchase. One of the biggest complaints on upsells, people like that have the upsells like, you bought this thing, but it's not really going to help you. Instead, you should buy this. Like you never want to do that. Okay. It leaves a bad taste in the customer's mouth and it's not congruent. Right? The first thing they purchase should be complete. Right? They're getting expert secrets. They're getting all these things like that's complete. So congratulations. You got this. Every you need to be able to become an expert, but then what's the next thing they need? Right? A good example of that is in the weight loss industry. Right? Like if you sell a book in the back, the book's like how to get abs. So someone buys the book about how to get abs. In their mind, they think that they already have abs. Right? Like they've already, they purchased that loose and clothes. Like, okay, I have abs now sweet. The book, the book's coming in. If you're upsells, like here's a video on how to get more abs. Like it's not going to convert because it's the same thing. Right? Instead in their mind, like that's been closed. Like in the mind, they, they bought the ad book, they got abs. Now the next logical thing that what's the new prom it opens? Well, I have abs, but when I go out to eat, I like, what am I supposed to do? Right? So they, a good upsell for a fitness product. Like, okay, now you've got abs. I'm going to show you guys how to go out to eat at your favorite restaurants, not gain more weight. Right? Same thing is true for me. Okay. So I bought this book. So in their mind, it's like, I'm an expert. Now I got the book. It's coming. Like I have everything I need to become an expert, which is true. Okay. So now I'm going to, that, that solved the prom, but now it creates a new prom. So the second part of this video is going to then explain, explain the new prom that's created now that they're an expert. Going through this process and executing it will be the most fulfilling thing you probably ever do in your life. I think you are going to love. I can't wait to get a copy of this book out into your hands. Literally the, my favorite thing about this is this is the updated version. So there's almost a hundred new pages information in case studies. People who are just like you who went through this process and now have huge followings online and they're changing the lives of the customers they've been called to service. I can't wait to get this book to you. It's going to change your life. Now the next step after you get this book is then you have to actually go out there and create a product. That's always step number two in the process. And so right now I have a very special offer for you because you are a newest customer. I wanted to give you access to one of our newest products called course secrets at a huge discount. Okay. So this is what I did. Okay. We solved this prom. Now the next thing you're going to need, step number two is this. I'm going to give you a thing, a special offer. Okay. And then here I make a very special offer. Now the, the rule with upsells or OTOs, OTOs, for one time offers that needs to actually be a special offer. Okay. So right now, if you go to course secrets.com, this is the sales video from course secrets. If you go there, we sell this course for $497. So you're going to get this entire course plus all these other bonuses for just 97. So it's an actual legitimate special offer, a one time offer. They only get here and it's a really discount. Okay. We've counted down clock here, everything. But that's kind of what happens right here. And then they've got two options. Yes or no. Okay. Now the yes button is like, yes, up to my word. And now the no should be a negative qualifier. Okay. So what that means is like, you don't want to say, no, take the numbers area. That's a positive thing. Right. It says, no, thanks. I'm not ready for step number two yet. I'll buy course secrets at a full price of $497, $497 in the future. Okay. You see that's like, ah, I really want to click on that. I'll pay 500 bucks later. It's like, ah, so I want them to be like, have some pain by saying no. Does that make sense? And so that's kind of how we structure the no thanks link. All right. Okay. And that's, that's, that's it for upsell number one. Okay. So we come back to funnel. So now you saw here's upsell number one. After upsell number one, now I'm going to introduce them to upsell number two. Upsell number two on this page right here is our selling online event. Now a couple of things you want to notice. Okay. When your customers are going through the upsell down, so sequence, one thing is confusing a lot of times is that they're like, they see a page like for example, they see this page right here and they go, the next page looks identical. They think that they're on same page loop and the lot happens to bounce in their leave. So I need to make things look different from page one to page two as I'm moving through the funnel. Okay. So you notice I hear in this video, right? I have blue headlines and stuff like that. I've got a green shirt upsell number two. I want to look different. So I have a different color shirt. Okay. Things look a little bit different. They're not identical. Okay. And so I'm doing that because I want people to know this is a different thing than the thing they just saw. Okay. So many times people's upsell one upsell two identical and then people are like, they're like, I'm in this loop, something's broken. They just leave and then they don't get to the thank you page. And you want to make sure something gets through every single page inside your funnel. Okay. All right. So it's up to number two. And again, here I'm selling my $97 event called selling online. And so the video here, me pitching it come down here. There's very quick, no or yes. Okay. And I love this style. There's different styles on, on, on upsell pages. This one obviously saw down here, which is you have the yes button here and then the no link down below. This right here, again, I want to be different. I have a red no thanks on left hand, green yes on the right hand side. Okay. So again, there's the video me pitching selling online event. There's a quick way they can go and they can buy or not buy. Right. And this video is very emotional. Then we go from emotion to what logic and fear. Right. So if they scroll through here, like, ah, they're not ready yet. And I start logically convinced them, here's more information. And then I go through and I have the entire sales video or sales letter that explains more about it, more testimonials, more information. Here's what you're going to learn about. Right. So for the logical buyer, there's more information for them to go through it. And I keep pushing back to yes or no, yes or no, make a decision. Yes or no. Right. PS. Here's what he offers one more time. Yes or no. Okay. So that's kind of how we structure that to get people into the selling online event. Okay. Now, if they say, again, selling online events, $97. So if they say, let me come back here, if they say, no, they don't want that, I still want them to be part of that event. So I'm like, what could I do? So if they say, no, I take them right here to a down sell and the down sell is, I'm using what's called an invisible funnel. So let me show you what that looks like. So there's the page and here's the down sell. So, okay, wait, I know you want to come to the event. What if you could come to the event and you could attend it for free and then only pay for after if you think it's worth it. Okay. So the down sell basically, when you come back here, saying, okay, the event was $97, you saw that. How about you come for free, attend the full three days and then after the event, then you'll pay the $100. What do you think about that? Okay. So it's a secondary offer. Again, we have a yes or no thanks link and those are the two different options. Okay. Again, I'm trying to pick up somebody because I want people to come to that event. I want them to attend the event. During the event, obviously, I make them another special offer. So I want to make sure I want to give as many people in the event as possible. So ideally, they pay the $97, but if not, cool, come for free anyway and you pay afterwards, try before you buy. We call that an invisible funnel. Okay. And so the down sell for the event is the invisible funnel. Okay. Now if I come back here and if they say, yes, they do buy, they do buy the ticket for $97, then I take them down to this other path and I'm going to upgrade them to a VIP pass. Okay. So here's the VIP upgrade. So they bought the $97 tickets like, cool. You bought the $97 upgrade. We don't upgrade the VIP day after the event. And then I have a video me explaining that. Boom. They have a chance to come down here and then they got the VIP and they can either buy the $97 VIP fly on the wall or they can get the question answered. And right now, the question answered sold out. So that's kind of what we do right here. Again, there's the yes button and no thanks link, then testimonials and then we transition from a mokin appears all emotion, right? We transition, we have a quick buy from emotional buyers. We transition now logic, testimonials, more information, logic, logic, logic, more stuff, more stuff, more stuff. There's the option to buy again, boom, more testimonials. And that's how it works on that page right there. Okay. So there, again, here's how we're going. We're going home page, upsell number one, upsell number two, they say no invisible funnel. They say yes, upgraded VIP. And then they were taking the thank you page and thank you page basically just says, all right, thank you so much for buying. Congratulations. Check your email for your login information. If they bought upsell, if they bought this selling online upsell, they can go and they can actually register for the event that they're going to attend right here. If they didn't, then this blocks actually going to have a page where they could upsell the go buy the ticket to the selling online event. Okay. So depending on if they, if they're a member or not depends on what happens on this block. That's the only difference between the two different two to thank you pages right here. Okay. And then all right. The second last thing is we have a spot right here where they can grab their affiliate link inside the new click funnels one of the coolest things you can create an instant affiliate link. So someone goes and signs up for your product on the thank you page. I can say, here's your filling and they promote it. They can get paid right away. So we're paid out 40% affiliate commission. Someone's bought the book and like it. They can grab this link post on social, sell a couple copies of the book and boom, get their money back instantly. Okay. And so we give them an instant affiliate link, which is huge for getting free traffic from your, from your buyers. And then step number three now is I push them to our next funnel. Okay. This is called funnel stacking. Someone buys the book. They have a good experience. And I say, Hey, by the way, here is a webinar I'm doing called the last secret. Click right here to register for it. They click on there, boom, it takes them over to the, to the next funnel inside of our funnel. We can go to the register for this, this webinar. They watch the webinar and now they're moved into the next funnel. Okay. And so that's, that's the process you guys. Everyone of my funnels leads to another funnel, which leads to another funnel, but that's kind of the process and how the whole thing works. Okay. I got two more things I want to show you guys. Okay. Real quick. I want to show you the cheapest traffic you can possibly get and also the highest converting traffic. This is one that most people miss on their funnels. It's insane. If you do nothing else, but just doing this one step and all of your click funnels, funnels, it'll change your business forever. Let me show you what it is. Okay. It's a retargeting out of, it's a special type of retargeting out. Okay. Someone comes this page and they, they see the offer and they don't buy. Like first off, you knew they're interested because they saw the initial hook, they, they listened to your story, they clicked on it, they showed up. But for some reason they didn't go and they didn't finish the purchase. It could have been because their wall was too far away. They were in a weird spot and they want to buy it later, but for whatever reason they didn't. So this is like the low hanging fruit. You're just going to push somebody over. And so I'm going to show you one of our retargeting ads. This, we use a version of this ad for every single one of our funnels. I'm not going to show you the whole thing. Let me show you one part of it just so you understand how it works because it's like the easiest, cheapest traffic, the easiest, like buyers, like everything is just simple. And so like this is a no brainer. Do you get nothing else? Say this one little piece, it'll be worth the weight of gold in and of itself. Basically what we do with this ad is it shows like if the book was 995, right? Like what else could they buy with the 995 if they're not going to buy this? Okay. So I'm not going to show the whole thing, but I want to show you the intro and how I intro it because you know what I'm like confused like, like what? Why did you buy? Like why are you leaving right now? And then from there I share nine other things they could buy for the same 10 bucks. And the more ridiculous those things are, the better. So check out how I start this video. All right. My name is Russell Brunson and recently you came to expertssecrets.com because you're like, I want to get a copy of Russell's brand new book. And then you left and you didn't get a copy. And I'm kind of confused. I'm not really sure why. So I want to talk to you about maybe it was like I can't afford the $9 and 97 shipping and handling, right? Maybe that was the reason. And if that's the case, I understand. But you're going to spend the nine bucks on something anyway. So I want to talk about nine other things you could buy instead of getting this copy of experts secrets which will literally change your business and probably change your life. So here are. Okay. And I go through with like a top 10 list, top nine list. Like number one, you could go get a haircut. Number two, it's going to be a crappy haircut for nine bucks. Number two, you're going to go to McDonald's and get a half mil on the drink. Number three, you get a cup of coffee at Starbucks. Like I'm just going to make this ridiculous list like you could spend that, you drink the coffee and it's gone forever. Or you get this book that'll change your life, literally teach you how to be an expert and like I show that, right? I start going through these things. And again, this is just a simple retargeting ad when someone hits the landing page and they don't buy, boom, this ad starts falling around. Thanks two or three days and a huge percentage of people now will see that like, you're right, I'll go find my wall. This is for 10 bucks. Like I'm in Russell, you got me. Okay. And so that's what the retarget looks like when somebody hits the home page or in your funnel and then they leave. All right.
