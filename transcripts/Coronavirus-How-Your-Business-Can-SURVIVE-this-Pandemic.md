Hey, hey, what's up everybody? Welcome to Saturday. I hope you guys are pumped to be here. I'm going to wait for a few minutes while we're getting ready to get on, but we've got a lot of fun stuff to talk about. The last couple days we posted on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, everywhere for you guys to ask me your Q&As, what questions you had about all sorts of stuff, marketing business, living in a Corona age and much other stuff. And so I've got the questions here and I got answers and it's going to be a lot of fun. So I'm pumped to be hanging out with you guys today and going through some of this stuff. And so that's kind of the game plan and it should be a good time. So while I wait for everyone to jump on, curious how you guys are doing. How are you guys all surviving the last two weeks? I feel weird because I've been going live with you guys every single day talking about the book launch and everything else like that. But I'm taking a break from my regularly scheduled programming to talk about some other stuff. And so that's kind of game plan. Hopefully you guys are all doing well. We're doing pretty good overall. I think it's been probably the hardest on our kids. They, especially one of our kids is so social. He wants to be out talking and being with friends and we fight such bad, you know, like the bad guys not allowing him to because of, you know, the whole quarantine thing. So anyway, we're going to have fun this morning playing with them all and we're going to play with them here a little bit as well. So anyway, excited to be hanging out with you guys today. And like I said, this is not going to be talking about the book today. So if you haven't got a copy of your book yet, you should totally go to trafisecrest.com. But that's not the point today. Today, I'm going to be doing some Q&A. And so I got a bunch of questions you guys have been submitting. You've submitted them. We've got questions coming in from Twitter, from Facebook, from Instagram, even LinkedIn, which I don't know how to log in LinkedIn, but there's questions come from LinkedIn as well. And so I'm going to go through these with you guys today. It should be a lot of fun. So before we go into that though, I've got three things I want to talk about that I think hopefully will help because I know we're still in such a time where people are just not sure what to think and they're nervous and I get it. In fact, today I was just getting messages from a lot of the companies that I normally go to all the time that I, hey, we're shutting our doors, at least for the next foreseeable future and we're hoping we can come back. But we have no idea if we'll be back or not. And it's like, oh, it's like that feeling of just like it's scary. And so I want to give you some peace and some hope and some understanding and hopefully help you guys feel comfortable with whatever the worst case scenario might be. So that's it. I got three things, a quote, and then we're going to Q&A. That's not like fun. All right, that's the game plan. So I'm going to start with the three things. So number one, I had a friend a couple of years ago named Dr. Chad Walner. In fact, I think I mentioned him in almost all the books. Chad is a great guy. And I remember one time, after he had started his chiropractic practice, he had been working for a while and it was just not going very well. And his point where it was about to just implode. I remember he called me that night and he was like, he's like, I'm in a bad spot. I need help. And I'm okay. I can help. Sure. So I went over to his practice and we sat down and I think he was waiting for me to be like, all right, Chad, here is the magic secret. If you apply this said secret to your business, you will be a butchillionaire and everything will go away. And as I listened to him longer and longer and longer, I could tell by the way he was talking that he was so scared of what could happen that it froze him from moving forward. And I'm sure that a lot of you guys are not sparring out. You're so scared of what could possibly happen that you're scared to move forward. Let me just feel that way right now. I'm curious. And it's okay if you do. It's a normal human response. Like that's not something to be ashamed of or anything. Like that's how that's, you know, all of us will get that myself included. And as I sat there listening to Chad that night and I was trying to get what kind of advice could I give him. I asked him, I said, look, for you to be able to move forward, you have to be completely okay with the worst case scenario. You got to be able to look at that and be like, look at it directly. I say, that's the worst case scenario. I'm okay with that. So I asked him, I said, what's, what's the worst case scenario if your practice fails? And I don't remember off the top of my head, all the stuff he said, but he said things like, oh, if I did, I'd have to lose my house and I have to go bankrupt. And then like, you know, what would my, what my, my family think? What are my in-laws think? What would the other chiropractors think about me? And like, you started going through all the things. And so we sat down with a pad of papers. Okay. All the worst case, like worst case scenario, write those things down, write them down, write them down. We looked at them all and then we started going through them. So, okay, is that really that bad? Okay. I think a lot of times we have the worst case scenario running through our heads and there's little pieces and it seems so alive and vibrant that we're like, ah, and so we try to ignore it, but this way it forces you to write it down. You write it down, you write it down and worst case scenario, what does that actually look like? And then you got to look at that directly in the eyes and be like, I'm okay with that. And we started going through his list one at a time. Like, okay, worst case scenario, you lose your house. Why is that such a big deal? It's like, well, I love my house. Like, yeah, but like there's tons of houses. Like you lose it, you get a new one. Like, like, would you be okay if you had to get new house? Like, yeah. Okay, well, what about the next thing? We went through thing by thing by thing. And now after we got through all of them, he was like, oh my gosh, like, I can't be in my head. It was such a big deal if I lost all this stuff and reality, it's not that big of a deal. Like I'd be okay. And as soon as he became completely okay with the worst case scenario, it was like his hand, the handcuffs broke off his hands. Now he was able to move forward because he could risk and if he risked and failed, it didn't matter anymore because he was okay with the worst case scenario. So for all you guys, the first thing I would tell you is like, you've got to figure out what is your worst case scenario and you got to be able to look at it. Like I usually written down so you can see it, look at it and say, I'm okay with number one, I'm okay with number two, I'm okay with number three. And as soon as you do that, it'll unlock you, the fear, unlock the frightening, you know, all those things that keep you back and you can start moving forward. Okay. So that's the first thing I want to share with you guys. Number two, right now, as you know, there's tons of companies that are shutting down, which means like the business owner who's risked all their time, energy money for the last, you know, however many years are losing things. The employees of those people are losing things. I think, again, it comes back to this worst case scenario, but the worst case scenario in those situations are I'd have to declare bankruptcy. I'd lose my entire business. I'd lose my livelihood. And I want you guys to understand, and I'm such a big founder of George Washington and the founding fathers and when they came to this country and they set up the nation, they set up the constitution and one of the greatest gifts that our founding fathers gave us as entrepreneurs were the bankruptcy laws. I think so many times in our mind, right? Oh, if I go bankrupt, I lost everything and like my life is destroyed and it's like, no, no, no, no, you don't understand. These were a gift from God, a gift from our founding fathers that they were given to us. So the us as entrepreneurs, we could try things and we could risk and if we failed, it wasn't like, oh, you failed to lock yourself up and you're in jail for the next 50 years of your life. Like you fail, you get it clear. It's a reset. You can reset and you can come back and do it again. I can't tell you how many of the hyper successful people I know that have gone through one or two or three different bankruptcies. And that's why you guys understand that like, because I know that there are going to be so many of you guys who go through this process that are like, it's the worst case scenario. It's going to happen for some people. Some of you guys listening to my voice right now, we're going to go through bankruptcy. You're going to lose everything. You're going to lose your house. It's going to be the worst case scenario. And, um, as long as you again, one, number one, look at it at the worst case scenario and be like, I'm okay with that. And then number two, looking at like the bankruptcy, like, look, this is a gift. Like, I'm able to reset and start over and like, and look at this as a, as a, as a new beginning. Like if you have to, like hopefully you don't have to, hopefully the things we've been teaching you will keep you from that. But I want you to understand that if that has to happen, it's okay. It's not the end of the world. Um, and so that those are the, those are the first things I want to talk about. Cause I think so many times we get so scared. What could happen that we just freeze him into anything and I will, I need you guys to unfreeze. Your people that you're serving need to your employees, your staff, your community. They need you to unfreeze. And so if the worst case scenario is keeping you from moving forward, we need to look at that straight in the eye and be okay with it. Be okay with bankruptcy, be okay with losing your house, be okay with it. Whatever those things are, you got to become okay with it. It's funny now that we've been in such a positive time since the last crash and how many entrepreneurs do you know who are like, man, 2008, I got destroyed, I lost everything, lost my house. It was the worst, the most painful thing ever, but I became smarter. I reinvented myself. I learned more and now I built this amazing company over here. The same story is going to be happening now. If you want the happy ending, you got to go through the turmoil. If you've gone through any of my books or my training, you know the hero's journey. We're in the middle of it. We're going through the journey of transformation right now. And now is the time for all of us to start transforming. It's time for us to become better, become smarter, become the people we need to be to be able to serve our community. The last thing I want to share before we go into Q&As, I actually heard Rachel and Dave Haulis on their podcast share this quote and I was like, this is amazing. And I found it posted on my personal Facebook wall, but I want to read it to you guys as well because this should give you peace. It did for me at least after I read it. I was like, huh, all right. And it was just like this, this release. And so I want to give this to you guys as a gift. And then we'll move into to Q&A. Okay. So here's the gift. So this is from CS Lewis. And this was during 1948. So it was the peak of World War II, the atomic bombs, all that stuff, right? And so they were living this A bomb, the atomic bomb age and everyone was freaked out and scared to death to do anything. Again, they were locked up because they like, ah, like if a bomb explodes and we all die. And this is a quote from CS Lewis, who by the way, CS Lewis is the man. In case anyone's not sure that he is amazing. So this is a quote he said, speaking about his time, his age. And I want you to listen to this with ears of like, this is like, like my time is different, but man, it's the same. Okay. So here we go. All right. From CS Lewis. It's called on living in an atomic age. All right. In one way, we think a great deal too much about the atomic bomb insert coronavirus. How are we, how are we supposed to live in atomic age? I'm attempted to, I'm, I attempted to reply, why as you would have lived in the 16th century when the plague visited London almost every year, whereas you would have lived in the Viking age when the raiders and Scandinavia by landing cut your throat any night, or indeed as you were already living in an age of cancer and age of syphilis and age of paralysis and age of air raids and age of railroad railway accidents and age of motor accidents. In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented insert coronavirus before the coronavirus is invented. And quite a high percentage of us were going to die in unpleasant ways. We had indeed one very great advantage over our ancestors and aesthetics, but we, but we have that still. It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to the world which already bristled with such chances in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty. This is the first point to be made. And the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves, is to pull ourselves together. If we're going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, or by a coronavirus, let that bomb come when it, let that bomb, let that bomb when it comes, find us doing sensible and human things, praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts, not whole together like fright and sheep and thinking about bombs. They may break our bodies, microbe can do that, but they meet, but they need not dominate our minds. Oh, I got chills again. What? That's the best quote you guys have ever heard. It is amazing. So I hope you guys read that. If you search CS Lewis living on atomic age, you can find it, you can read, you can print out, read to your family, read to your kids. If you have my personal Facebook profile, not my business one, but like my personal like Russell Brunson, I posted on the wall there. You can see it there. Copy and paste it. Share it. Please. Like the more like this is the kind of messaging that people need to be hearing right now, not the garbage that's supposed to, I suppose down there is, I actually have no idea. I don't know how to listen to the news. So yeah. Anyway, should I read it like with the coronavirus in there? I'm gonna read it one more time with the coronavirus in there. In one way, we may think of a good, in one way, we think a great deal too much of the coronavirus. How are we to live in a coronavirus age? I'm tempted to reply, why as you would have lived in the 16th century when the plague visited London almost every year, whereas you would have lived in the Viking age when raiders from Scandinavia might land and cut your throat any night, or indeed as you are already living in the age of cancer and age of syphilis and age of paralysis and age of air raids and age of railroad accidents of car accidents of, one of the other things we're dealing with, an age of motor accidents. In other words, we do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or dear madam, you and all whom you love were already sentenced to death before the coronavirus was ever invented, and quite a high percentage of us were gonna die in unpleasant ways anyway. We had indeed one very great advantage over our ancestors, anesthetics, but, I'd say penicillin or whatever, but we have that still. It's pretty ridiculous to go about whimpering and drying long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of a painful and premature death to the world which already bristled with such chances and in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty. This is the first point to be made and the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we're going to be destroyed by the coronavirus, let that virus come when it comes. Finders doing sensible and human things, praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting with our friends over a pint and game of darts, not huddled together like fright and sheep thinking about coronavirus, about viruses. They may break our bodies, a microbe can do that, but they cannot dominate our minds. Oh, so good. C.S. Lewis told you he's the man. All right, hopefully I gave you guys some paint and some hope to keep on going today. Okay, do you guys remember Q&A time? So I got a bunch of Q&As, they've came in about all sorts of stuff from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. So my team went through a bunch of them, found some of their favorite ones, so I'm going to try to answer them live right now with you guys if you're okay with that. If you guys okay with delivery? So I want to make sure because I can go back to bed. If you guys okay with that, we're delivering. Everyone's cool. All right, if you're okay with that, I'm in. Okay, here we go. Question number one from Twitter. This is from atmanualmarcino. He says, I know you say that sales funnels work for any niche product or business, but according to your experience, what would you give your top five niches where you can skyrocket sales doing correctly, of course, thanks in advance. Okay, so sales funds work in all businesses, but what are the best ones? Okay, this is really simple. When I look at businesses as a whole, I break it down into a couple things, right? There's like, there's businesses like the top and it breaks down to a couple of things. There's like the product based businesses, like people selling products, then there's like the service based business, which people selling services. Yeah, that's like the first tier. So all businesses, you selling a product or you selling a service that underneath that it breaks down to like, okay, if you're selling a product, is it information products? Is it physical products? Is it you know, whatever, like you have a couple of different types of products and services. What kind of services is it? A software as a service, right? Click funds as software as a service. Is it a service like your dentist or chiropractors? Is it service like your financial planner? Like, it goes from there, right? And so for me, it's like, if you really want to look at like what businesses work best for sales funnels, it starts at the very beginning, right? Or any business selling a product, any business selling a service, okay, boom, then go one level deeper. Okay, what types of products? Physical products, info products, supplements, you know, plug in different types of products, it works very good to that tier as well. And then same services, you go one tier lower, software as a service, services as a service, dentist, chiropractor, home cleaner, financial planner, like everything, right? Like that tier works as well. Now, the yeah, and again, I think it works for all types of businesses, but it's going looking at that way, like going to teardown and teardown and maybe there's some, some version of like services, financial planner services, or financial, you know, restaurant services, and then like this weird thing that doesn't work. And so maybe it gets harder to work, you know, down deeper in the, in the thing. But honestly, it doesn't, it gets easier actually, the further deeper you get. So anyway, I think that understanding that like the niches matter less as much as like the products of services, as far as like what niches work the best, it's niches that have people that are willing and able to spend money. Like that's the key, you guys understand. A lot of times people are willing to spend money, right? But they're not able. So like they're willing, like, I remember I had a friend who launched a video game course to teenagers, and he had all these kids who were, they were willing to spend money, they wanted to buy that thing, but they were not able, they didn't have money, right? Well, the flip side of that, there's people who are, who are able to buy something, but they're not willing. Okay, one of my friends, Joel Irway, he came, joined the inner circle and he was selling coaching to, if I remember right, I'd say engineers, and engineers were able to buy, they had the money, but they were not willing to buy for coaching. They did not want to coach, right? Like they, this is just a different mindset of a person. So the best niches are niches where people are both willing and able to spend money. So what are those niches? Okay, well go and look online, like what, where's commerce happening right now, right? And if you can't, if you're, like, I can't find anyone selling something similar to this market. Okay, means that that market's probably not willing or able to buy. If you're like, everybody's selling this market, it's like, ah, yeah, it's because they're willing, they're able to buy. Those are usually a better spot to start on a worse spot. Okay, and that's a great question from Manuel. Next question from Twitter is from at economy spark. With everyone at home right now, is the cost of ads, is the cost of ads skyrocketing or is it offset by other industries holding back in the moment? Okay, so I'd say this is, it depends on the market. Most markets, as the whole ad cost had dropped, it's like a big, okay, there's so much fear, tons of companies like, ah, I'm afraid I'm gonna cut my marketing, which is the dumbest thing. It's like, oh no, I scratched myself. Let me shut my heart off so it doesn't, so I don't bleed out. Like if you show your heart off, you die. Like you guys realize that, right? If you just like, yeah, that's what's happening when you cut your marketing budget. But that's the thing people default to because they're like, ah, I'm spending money here, I need to cut it out. And it's like, ah, don't cut out the lifeblood of your company, cut other things. In fact, there's a really, really, really good book. And I'm gonna blank it out right now. I bought a copy for like everyone, my management team to start listening to. I think Stephen Larson's one that told me to buy it initially. But this is something, I'm looking at Amazon, it's a fake-finding order real quick while we're talking. But now's the time to be cutting like the unessential things. Don't be cutting the things that are like, what you need. You know what I mean? Like marketing is what you need. You know, blend your company is what you need. Okay, the book is called Double Your Profits in Six Months or Less. 78 Ways to Cut Costs. Oh, here we go. 78 Ways to Cut Costs and Your Profits in Six Months or Less. I'm on my phone and my iPad here. I'm gonna take Instagram over there first. Instagram, here you go. That's what the book looks like. Highly recommend reading it. It'll give you 78 things to cut costs. And it's not cut your advertising budget. Okay, so if you're like freaking out right now, go read that book. Here you go. There's the book. It's called 70 Double Your Profits. Go read that book. It'll show you the right things, cut not the wrong things. How to make sure you're not doing dumb things to your business for you're doing good things. But ad costs have dropped. I talked to Hermosi. Hermosi said his ad costs are down 6x, 600 times cheaper than they were before. So now is definitely the time, I think, to start buying ads that you just can't. So, all right, don't cut the marketing. All right, so those are my questions on Twitter. Now we're moving on to the book of faces. So Facebook questions coming in. All right, so the first one's from Shauna Lorraine. Thank you, Shauna. So it says, what is your current personal KPIs in this new stay at home world so you can be the best version of yourself for others in your business? And how do you measure your proficiency, if that's the word, with your personal development KPIs? Okay, so it's a good question. So in my business, we have certain KPIs we always focus on. One of my KPIs is always how many people every day are joining our list. We're always looking at how many people every day are joining ClickFunnels. Those are our KPIs we're looking at. We're focusing right now. And partially it's because I'm in the middle of a book launch. One of my biggest KPIs is just like, how many people can I talk to about the book right now? Right? That's my biggest thing. So right now I'm doing tons of podcast interviews, Facebook lives, you've probably seen some of them. And if you've seen like two or three, means for every two or three you see, I've done 10 other ones that you haven't been able to see, right? So we're, that's my biggest thing is like, I got to get, excuse me, a message out for as many people as possible, especially right now that everyone's at home, people who typically were too busy to do interviews are now sitting at home like, sure. And I'm the same way I couldn't do interviews for years. Like last time I did any interviews with the expert Seekers book launch like three years ago. And right now I've gotten a little more time. And so I'm doing tons more interviews and things like that. And so I think that's the big thing. My KPIs, how many people can I get in front of every single day? You know, if I can be in front of, if I can do five interviews at each interview, he's got a thousand people, you know, see the first day or 5,000 or whatever the number is. That's kind of what I'm looking at personally, my own personal self. I also think for like, for all of us right now who are leaders who have a following, I think going live daily is so essential right now. People slip back so quickly into like the fear mindset. It's like, they need you to step up and talk to keep themselves out of fear. Or else fears can freeze them up. I've talked about when we first began this party. So, all right. That's from Sean. Thank you very much. All right, next Facebook question is from Richard Peter Harding. He says, starting an online business from scratch was the best advice for getting started and growing really, really fast. All right, the best advice. And I had one of my friends yesterday, he just potentially lost his job. And he's like, can I get on a call with you? So, he got a call with me and we started looking and he's got a bunch of business ideas. I was like, the first thing is you gotta figure out like one business. Us entrepreneurs are probably trying to figure out five or 10 or 12. Like, there's more opportunities we can handle. First one is what kind of, what's the actual business you want to be? And number two is do you have access to the customers that you need? Okay. That's the thing. I used to always build companies where I'd build a product or service and then go try to find customers. And when I did it that way, I would have success maybe one out of, I don't know, every five or six times. Now when I build a business, I go and I find the traffic source first. And if I can find it, then I go and build a company around it. Right? And so, I figured, what do I want to do? And then I would stop and say, okay, let me go find the traffic sources. Like, where are they? Okay. And so, I go and I go to the podcast director. I find every single podcast. Okay. Or like, can I get on a podcast to get in front of my, the people that someday would buy this thing I'm thinking about creating. Can I make the list? And then immediately I'd start getting all the podcast shows. Then I go to Facebook, who are all the people that have already congregated my dream customers. And can I find those people? If I can't find these people on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, podcasting, these are different channels, I'm not going to build a business. I need to know that when those product or services done, these are the things, this is where the traffic's going to come from immediately. And that's what I'll be focusing on, to make sure my business is successful right out of the gates. Which by the way, not, I'm going to plug my book or anything, but if I was to plug my book, it's all we talk about here in Traffic Secrets. So, I just putting it out there. It's free at traficsecrets.com, but I don't want to talk about that right now. Okay, this is not about traffic secrets. But that's what I'll be doing. I'll be looking like where are the customers at? Can I find those people and then build products or services that those customers actually want? One of the other big problems that we have as entrepreneurs is we create what we want. And that's not how it works. The market responds to figuring out what, like you get paid based on figuring out what the market wants. And then, and that's the big secret, right? So it's like, I always tell people like there's, there's two things you gotta figure out when you go into a new market, or you start a business. It's the what and how. What are you selling? Not, not what do you want to sell? What does the market want to buy? What are you selling that the market wants to buy? And then how are you selling it? And the how is like, what's the funnel you're going to use? Like is it a webinar? Is it a high ticket? Is the phone calls? You know, like the what and the how. And a lot of times people feel like what to sell but not how. Like for example, I launched ClickFunnels. We knew what we knew what it was. We created it. So we knew what to sell, but I tried to sell it and it didn't work. Okay, so let me get this first story, the first funnel flop, second funnel flop, third, four, fifth, and the sixth funnel hit. The six funnels I figured out the how. We had the what, but then we figured out the how and boom. So if you got the how, for a ClickFunnels, from zero to two common club in a week. For most people, it's like, you know when you got the what and the how right? Because when you do, your business, boom. And for most people, it's not going to be a week, but, but it goes fast. Since you figured out the what and how, it explodes fast. And so that's the biggest thing you got to be figuring out. It's like, what does the market actually want? And then how do I sell it to that market? What in the how? And I first got to figure out like, where is the market at? So find those people, find the congregation, what do they actually want? And how am I going to sell it? When you got that out, boom, it explodes fast. Sometimes you got to create a lot of offers. I don't be scared like, ah, the first one didn't work. Yeah, like, like I did a lot of, I did a lot of, a lot of versions of ClickFunnels before it took off. I did a lot of, I think 120 some odd funnels before the ClickFunnels funnel, like just different products, different services, try to figure out like, what is the thing people want? And each one had different levels of success. Basically, he's just putting out a lot of offers. And a lot of times you don't have to like, your audience doesn't say yes to the offer right now, right? It's like, hey, I'm thinking about putting it together a live virtual event, we're gonna bring in like 30 speakers and we're gonna do a thing and like, I'm just curious for those who follow me, I would you be interested in something like that? If I put it together, would you say, would you, would you jump on? Would you be willing to pay for something like that? And ask your audience, and if they come back and just crickets and they say, no, they're like, all right, never mind. In fact, this is cool. I heard Greg Davis, one of my old, old school buddies from last 10 years, great marketer. And he posted something probably two or three weeks ago on his Facebook page. He said, he said, a lot of people think that I have new offers every single week. He's like, I don't, I do, I post offers every week. Like, hey, I'm thinking about doing this, hey, I'm putting together this. And he's like, the majority of them, I never do because nobody ever comes in there, they don't ever come and like, actually buy the, like they, nobody raises their hand and gives me money. So I don't ever do them. He's like, so why you think I'm doing much stuff like, you know, if I'm failing or I'm succeeding, I'm just putting it out there. And if it, the idea doesn't take, then I just leave it alone. And, and I try another idea. He's like, I'm only like one out of 10 of these things I'm putting out there to ever actually create. Because I'm waiting to find out what the market wants before I create it. Oh, Greg, very, very smart. All right. Next question for Facebook. This is from Shana Smith Scott. And I have not actually pre read these questions. So we could, we could bump into one that could be a nightmare for me. So watch in case I crash and burn. All right, Shana, Shana Smith Scott, is it better to use OFAC to get already established? Oh, like what's OFAC? One Funnel Way Challenge. Is it better to use one Funnel Way Challenge to get already established, but currently unsuccessful business to thrive, or to start a new business with a bang? Okay, so we got a lot of years about the one Funnel Way Challenge, the 30 Challenge we have people go through to help figure out their first or the next funnel. So the question that her question is like, is it better to use one Funnel Way Challenge for my existing business that's kind of struggling, or should I do a new business that's, that's going to be brand new and kind of a shiny object? And the question is depends. There's so many, Marcus said 4500 offers, or four or five, I think is what I said. Anyway, sorry, come back. All right. So for one Funnel Way Challenge, so the answer depends. If you got a business and it's, I mean, like, if you think there's something there, if you're like, I just got to figure out the, like, I know what I had the right product, but what's the, I got the web, what's the, how, how am I going to actually sell it? If that's the thing that's keeping that business being successful, go through the OFA Challenge, looking at through that lens, like, how am I going to sell this product? I got to figure out the right hooks, right stories, right offers, like all that stuff, figure out the how and blow it up. If you're looking at a business like this business is dead, like the chance of survival is almost nothing. I don't have the right what. So, you know, like, I can figure it out, but I'm not, I can figure it out, but I'm not that passionate about it. Then I would say then start something new. Okay. So if you have the right what, like the right offer, the right thing people want you to sell it right, then yes, use the OFA Challenge to amplify that. And if you're like, I, the what over here is just not working, nobody's buying it. Then go through the OFA Challenge, the One Fun Away Challenge with a, with a, with a lens of like, I'm creating something new from scratch. I'm excited about that. Got energy that I'm passionate about. And if you're not a member of the One Fun Away Challenge, we start one every, I think, about every two weeks, onefunaway.com, 100 bucks, best 100 bucks you'll ever spend, ever. Unless you're hungry, then that's probably better. But this would be the second best thing you spend 100 bucks on. All right. Facebook question number four from Jason Green. How do you keep going knowing very little or listening to your message, even though you truly believe is positive and important? Oh, good question, Jason. So how do you keep publishing when nobody's listening, even though you feel like your message is positive and important? So I was lucky when I started, my first podcast was called The Marketing in Your Car podcast, which later became the Marketing Secrets podcast. It was marketing your car. And I did it because I was dry, like my business had just collapsed. I had no more customers. I like everything was, it was like the worst time to start a podcast. I thought, but I was like, I got something, I need to do something to start this podcast. I would do it while I was driving to the office and back. And I didn't know how to do a podcast initially. So we set it up through some like crappy little system that didn't track sales or stats or anything. We just like, excuse me, set it up. I started podcasting and three years after I launched my podcast, I was going live at least three times a week for three years. Then finally, like, like, you know, my business failure that turned around, it was sure I'm successful again. And about that time is when we decided to shift it to the marketing secrets podcast. And so we shifted over to new system and the new system tracked ads and showed or not tracked ads, tracked downloads and stats. And as I moved it over, also I saw how people were downloading. I was like, Oh my gosh, this is so cool. And I realized that like, if I would have seen my stats the first three years of me publishing, guess what would happen? I would have depressed and would have stopped. Luckily for me, I never saw the stats. I just kept going, kept going, kept going. And eventually people found me. There's a quote in the traffic seekers book, not that I'm trying to plug it again, but if you ever have a chance to read it, it's in there. It's a, I quoted a blog post from Nathan Berry and the blog post, the title was endure long enough to get noticed. And we talked about how like a lot of times good TV shows are things like that are in season two or three before you see them, right? And he's like, why is that? Why is that so? He said, the reason is because there's so much content being published out there that that us as humans, we naturally wait for the best stuff to rise to the top. And so part of publishing, part of it's, you know, there's two really big reasons why we're publishing. Number one is for you to find your voice and get more comfortable, right? That's why I'm alive on this and talk to four hours and just be completely fine because I've done this so many times. Like I found my voice, I feel comfortable, I know my stories, I know, you know, like I found my voice. That's the first reason why you're doing it. The second reason is you're doing it long enough that your audience can actually find you. Okay. And that might be six months, might be a year, might be two years, it doesn't, it doesn't matter. If you really care about your thing, it shouldn't matter. You're just talking because you love it. And just publishing is like part of it. You got to publish them, promote it, right? You publish it and then share it on different places and try to get people and like, like, there's other things you should be doing to try to like boost that. But, but a big part of it is number one, you're finding your voice number two, you're doing it long enough that people can find you. And so it's got, it's important to be consistent. So don't get discouraged. Like don't get down at all. Like I had three years of podcast episodes before anyone was probably even listening. And that's okay. Because now, guess what? They're listening. But it's because I was consistent for an extended long period of time. All right. Thank you, Jason. Great question. All right. I think, is this the last of my Facebook question? Oh, a couple more Facebook ones. Okay. Next one's from Leanne Johnson. What? I probably said that wrong. Sorry in advance. How to stay the course and it feels like everything around you is crumbling. I've been able to switch my business from brick and mortar to online virtually in a couple of days, adding massive value. But how to panic and fear in clients? How to get them to not want to cancel due to financial fears? All right. Couple things. Number one, a lot of them are going to cancel due to financial fears. That's okay. Okay. Doesn't mean you should go cut your, you know, I got you. So you were like, oh, my products are free now. I'm like, oh, why would you do that? Because now you just crippled yourself and you crippled them. Now they're expecting freebies to the rest of their life. They're going to strike. They're not going to be successful with people. Right? Like when your kids try to learn to walk and they fall down, do you just like, like pick them up and they go, no, like you let them figure it out a little bit. I think that's part of it. The other part of it is like, if you're not careful, you can destroy your own business by doing that. Right? Like you, it's like the whole, when you're in the airplane, you know, the mask comes down. It's like, put your own mask on first. You don't die before you like save your friends because you save your friends and then you both die. Right? Like you got to protect yourself as well. And so I see all these companies are cutting their prices, making things free. It's like, it's not the right strategy, you guys. It doesn't serve them and it doesn't serve you, especially like right now with ClickFunnels, we've got 400 some odd employees all around the world. Everyone's working from home. And if I also didn't like cut my, my, my cost in half, guess what? I got to lay out half my staff, which means now I can't support the customers, which means like everything starts crumbling really, really quickly. Okay. And it's very important for you to stay the course and be okay. If you left to leave, that's okay. They'll leave. They'll come back when they're, when they're okay. But you got to be okay with that. Like that's not, that's not your problem. That's, that's their problem. And you got to, you can try to serve them. You can do things you can, you know, like, like whatever you can do, but it's just important for you like to, you got to be consistently doing it. So that's, that's a big part. The other thing about staying the course, and I shared this two weeks ago, right at the very first Facebook live kind of talking about the coronavirus. And I'm going to share a story again. I've shared so many times with my team and other people, but it's, I share it because it's true. And hopefully this picture of this in your head will help inspire you. But think about force scum, right? The movie force scum. And hopefully you guys have watched this as I talked about it. I haven't watched it again yet, but I want to, but there's a scene in force scum where force scum for lieutenant and they're like the worst shimpers ever. And they're losing to everybody, all these big huge ships out there just destroying them. Right. And some of you guys may have been in that situation in the last few years, right? I'm looking around and like, I'm a little dog in this big pond. Everyone else has beaten me up. Everyone else's business, make more money, blah, blah, blah, right. And then all of a sudden the storm comes in, right? And what is lieutenant Dan and force scum do? They go out on their boat and they, in the middle of the storm, start going crazy and they're partying and they're jumping around and they're having fun and like they're just doing this thing. And while everyone else pulls their, pulls their boats off and like puts them on the dock, like, I'm not doing anything during the storm and wait until it's over and they sit back and they wait, right? Because they're out in the middle of the storm fighting with their boat and with their, with their, uh, with their people and with everything to keep it, keep it alive. When the storm calms the seeds, their boats in the middle of the ocean is still alive. You look around and all the boats around the harbor, all the boats around the coastline are destroyed and then they're the only boat left, right? And you look at that and what happens? In the movie, they become bubble gum shrimp factory and they become billionaires and all this stuff. And like, well, it's a cute little story for a movie. It's, it's the reality of the situation, right? The people who can hang on, who are able to survive and stay the core strength this time are the ones that are going to win. Okay. And so it doesn't mean you, you, you may not be as profitable over the next two or three months or six months or who knows what that is. That's okay. Like right now it's the time. That's why I said, go read the book, double your profits in six months or left. Like ever since you go read that book, it's got 78 ways to cut costs, increase yourselves and dramatically improve your bottom line. Like go read that book, you'll feel what things to cut and that way you can stay up here and you're not getting sucked under and you're in your business are dying, but you're able to stay protected. You're doing that kind of stuff there. And then, and then, and then on the other side of it, now it's like you're stable and you're in a spot where now you can grow these people, the people that they used to come that aren't able to come anymore who are financially freaked out. Like that's okay. Like let them be freaked out. Like wish them luck. Have them go and like, like when you, when, when you're back, when you're able to come back and you feel good, then come back at that point, but don't freak out right now. Right. We have a lot of people who cancel click phones accounts. I'm like, I hate that. It's like, it's okay. Like go get your, your fairs in order. Like there's things more important than that. And when you're done, we're going to still be here. I want you to come back and I will be here to support you at that point as well. Okay. So anyway, hope that helps Leigh Ann. I believe in you. Be brave. You can keep doing it. All right. Next one from Facebook, Alec Jepsen. Hey, you're also my questions. How long should we try one funnel before pivoting and attempting another? I want to do everything I can, but I also don't want to waste my time. Hope that was very clear. Thanks for all you do. Okay. So good question. Yeah. What a lot of people do is they, they put up a funnel. They try something that doesn't work and they're like, I'm out. I wish everybody had the new, so the new dot com secrets book, I added a chapter at the end called Funnel Audibles. And it's all about this concept of like most funnels fail the first time, even for mine. Okay. It's okay to understand that. So you build the funnel out there and then you drive some, say you spend a thousand dollars in traffic or $500 in traffic and you go and you see what happens, right? You let it go through the whole thing. And what's going to happen is if you do that, you drive a bunch of traffic, a bunch of stuff happens at the end of it. Hopefully you made your $500 back. My goal is always that I was looking like, if I was to sell one customer something, like if I'm testing a webinar funnel, right? So let's say I have a webinar funnel, I'm spending a thousand or the products, a thousand bucks, I'm going to invest $1,000 in ads because I know that if I sell one product, I break even, right? So I spent a thousand bucks ads, they go through and hopefully one person bought and broke even if so cool. Now I've got a funnel that can work. Okay. If I spend a thousand dollars ads and nobody buys it, it's like, ah, the funnel, the funnel might not be good. But then I can step back and look at the numbers. Okay. How much should I spend per click? How much should I spend when someone comes to the landing page? You know, how much should I spend per lead? How much should I spend per revenue, when I'm registering? Like I'm looking at all the numbers and along, along the funnel, right? Whenever someone tells me, oh, my funnel doesn't work, I'm like, what are the numbers? Like, I don't know. I'm like, okay, well, that's why it didn't work. You don't know your numbers. Like when I ask that question, like what, what were your, what were your numbers? You should be able to say, okay, well, I spent a thousand dollars in ads from that, I've spent $3 per click from that from a thousand dollars ads. I got, I got 180 opt-in. So I was paying what's that $8 in opt-in or whatever. And then from there we had 20, you know, 12% showed up or 18% showed up. So it, so it cost me whatever per show up. And then we sold one at the end. Right. So if you told me those numbers, I look at that and say, okay, cool, three bucks per click. You know, is that good or bad? Okay. Boom. Then how much per opt-in, how much per lead, how much did you spend? And you're looking at those numbers and I can look at that funnel and be like, Oh, well, the ad cost was good. The landing page cost was good. The show break was really low. Right. So how do we fix that? How do you make people show up? Or it's like this, you know, the ad you're spending way too much on clicks so that the ad sucks. Right. Or the ad was awesome, but, but nobody's opt-in. Like we just know which page to fix. So I usually go through three or four different iterations that way. I'm looking at the numbers, seeing which piece wasn't working and then make the tweaks and changes, try and try and get in within three or four times. It's not working. I'm like, this must not be the right offer. There's something wrong. This is not, not here yet. Let me try a different offer. Let me try a different thing. Okay. And so, yeah, we just spent three or four times testing a funnel, which difference traffic sources and, and seeing first. Yeah. So hopefully that helps. But yeah, don't be afraid. We have this, this two set, this two, this two, two-headed thing with entrepreneurship, right? It's like, I don't quit. I don't quit. But it's like, but if something's not working, you should quit. But like, not the business, but the project or the funnel, right? I had a friend when I got started, he'd been in the business for five years. He'd written, written an ebook and he was trying to sell it and nobody was buying it. And he was like five years in and, and he still was trying so hard. Nobody was buying it. And remember asking him, I'm like, why don't you create a different product, different service? He's like, I spent so much time on this project. I can't, I can't abandon it now. I was like, oh, you're just been another five years. It's just, it's not a good offer. It's not a good product. Nobody wants it, dude. I'm so sorry. You had to be able to be honest. Like, does the market actually want this thing? Okay, we talked about a little earlier. If you're coming in now, make sure you watch this whole video, but we talked about, if you got the what in the how, like, like, what does the market actually want? So what do you want to create? What does the market actually want? And if you're doing some funnels and driving some traffic and nobody's buying, then the market probably doesn't want that thing. You got to create something different. Okay. All right. Okay, next question, Facebook from Gabriel Closer, beginner here would love to know how to target the correct audience for product I'm about to launch. Well, you should definitely step in one, not that I'm pitching this or anything, or in the middle of a book launch, but there's this really big book called Traffic Secrets that teaches you how to do that. You can get for free at trafficsecrets.com, Discover Shipping, but we'll talk about that a different day because today we're talking about these other things. So the biggest thing is that that should have been a question. Again, I talked about this earlier. That shouldn't be a question you asked before. You said, how do I find the right audience for product I'm about to launch? You did it out of order. The order is the, I need to find the audience first and figure out what they want and create a product for them. Okay. So if you listen back to what I talked about maybe 10 minutes ago or so, that's what I'd be looking at is where's the audience first? Okay. So you figure that out. You got to figure out, step one, Traffic Secrets, who's my dream customer? Question number two is like, where are they actually congregating? I need to go find those people. So I figure who they are, where are they congregating? And then I go to those congregations and see what are the things they're complaining about? What are their problems? What are their frustrations? How can I serve these people? And that's how you come with your product. Your ideas is like looking at what, like the congregations of your dream customers, what are their fears, their complaints, their problems, their things they need more help with, right? Like we need to build click funnels because I'm in tons of entrepreneurial groups and everyone's frustrated about how hard it was to build a funnel. I'm like, oh, well we should just build software that makes funnels like boom idea was handed to me on a silver platter. I'm not a genius. People are like, well, so you're so smart. No, not that smart. I just listen really, really well. Right. Like the, like when I wrote the dot com seekers book, right? It's because we had click funnels and nobody had to like could not understand the concept of funnels. I'm like, okay, let me write a book on that. So I wrote a book, boom called dot com secrets showed my processor funnels. Okay. And then I listened to the market and the market was struggling and like, these funnels good, but am I a phone's converting and buying ads and not making money? Why not? I'm looking at the funnels like, well, it's because you suck at telling your story. You don't know how to tell a message. You don't know how to get somebody. So I was like, Hey, book number two, like they want to learn to tell story. Let me write the second book expert seeks about how to, how to, how to tell their story inside their funnels. That was book number two. And then I listened. People are like, man, my funnels are good and things are, you know, things are working. I just wish I could grow up, but I can't scale because I don't know how to get traffic. Like, Oh, you don't want to get traffic. Oh, why not get traffic? Let me write a book about it. Right? It's not me reinventing the wheel. I'm not a genius. And like, Oh, Russell's so smart. He's so good. No, none of that. I just listened. Who's my dream customer? Where are they congregating? And I insert myself in these congregations and I listened, right? I listened to the podcast. I'm in the Facebook groups. I'm in the blogs and listening to find out exactly what they, what they want. Ryan said, if you ever break through advertising, Russell, please, I've got that thing memorized. Come on. I'm an OG. I've been doing the same for 18 years. If they are dead and they talked about marketing anytime in their life, I read that book and then memorized it. So yes. All right. Great question. All right. Next one from Shannon Smith Scott. He's a better user of a question. That's twice. So we're good there. All right. We're moving on to the Instagram. Instagram. We got some questions from you. I've got a couple. So Instagram number one from at Lewis, the car may ho probably pronounced that wrong. Sorry in advance. What are some tools used to find your dream customers? So my big secret is any market that I enter into, I am already like, I am the dream customer. Right? So I look at like, if I'm going to build a business, it's like, if we're the things I'm already passionate about, right? So I know for me, I'm passionate about marketing, right? So I'm already in all the marketing circles, right? I'm already reading marketing blogs and I'm listening to the podcast. I'm already there because like it's a market I'm passionate about, right? I'm into biohacking. So I listen to all the biohacking podcasts. I'm in their Facebook or something like, like, if I was kind of business, like I'm already, like I am one of my dream customers. I'm already in that market. I would know exactly what those people need because I'm one of those people. And so the question is like, what are the tools used to find your dream customers? It's me. Where am I at? Like, where do I go right now? Right? That's the big part. This is something we used to do back in the day that I shared on an interview that's we can people freaked out about. I don't know if this is still around. There used to be a site called, I'm sure it's still around. It's called stumbled upon and I used to sit in my bed at night and in stumbled upon, you can put in keywords of the stuff that you're interested in and you click the button called stumble and it would find different sites that you might be interested in. And so that's how I would find like, here, like where are the sites of my dream customers are on? I sit in my bed and just click on the stumble button. It's like, Oh, there's a blog. I never seen this blog before. Let me follow it. Oh, there's someone's email list. I kept clicking through. I just find these random sites that have my topic. And from there I started, I met a ton of my dream partners from that. So just kind of a cool little sneaky thing you can use to go find where your customers are hiding now. Next is a question from Brandon R. Wall. I was going to start a business, but then the economy crashed. Can I still be profitable out of the gate or should I wait for when people are more likely to spend money? Oh, Brandon, more people spent money last two weeks than the past two years combined. They are buying stuff. They're buying different things though. Right? Perry Belcher, my buddy, is here on Survival Life. Okay, this is the busiest his business has ever been. Okay, the toilet paper people, the hand sanitizer, like there's money there. It's understanding like, what are people buying now? Not like, I'm going to wait for people to buy again. Like, no, no, no, people are still buying. So understand that. What are they buying? That's where you insert yourself. What are they buying? Okay, don't, don't confuse, don't, don't believe the misconception that they're not buying now. They are. Now is the best time to start a business. People are spending, and they're not spending, like right now they're hoarding their money because they're not spending it on, I'm going to move these or restaurants, they've got money and they're blowing it online. Okay, our business is up right now over the last two weeks. A lot of businesses are up over the last two weeks. Okay, so now's the perfect time. Just make sure you pick a business, like buy what people or sell what people are buying, right? Find people buying and you sell that. That's the big secret. Find people buying and sell that. Next one is from at Read Pretty. How do you present offers in a time when everyone is financially impacted? Great question. How do you create offers so or how do you present offers the right way? I talked about this in a couple Facebook lives and stuff this week, I'll share here as well. In the first secret of Traffic Seekers book, I talk about when you find a dream customer, you have to understand that people are going to come to you because they're moving in one or two directions, right? They're either coming to you because they're trying to move towards pleasure, or they're trying to move away from pain. Okay. What's interesting is over the last eight to 10 years, we've been in a great economic time, it's mostly people bought your products or services because they were interested in moving towards pleasure, right? So they bought because they wanted to get six pack abs, they wanted to get a nice house, a nice car, they wanted to be rich, they wanted to whatever product service you sold, they were trying to buy your product or service because it was going to move them towards pleasure. Okay, two or three weeks ago, everything shifted where everyone got into a state of pain, right? And the companies are going to succeed at the ones who look at that and say, okay, right now everyone's in a state of pain. How do I transition my product, my service, instead of being something that moves you towards pleasure, but it gets you out of pain? The product doesn't have to change, but the marketing of the product does change. Does that make sense? You got your goal is to shift so you can pull people and get them out of pain. What do you guys understand? Like that's the big secret, that's the big key. I was talking to Dean Graciosi about this. Dean is an amazing guy. During the last recession, he had an infomercial, teach people how to make money in real estate. And Dean at the time was like one of like 50 people who had real estate infomercials. And then 2008 hit boom, market crashes, boom, no one's buying houses anymore. And then went from 50 infomercial dudes to 40, 30, 10, 12, and all of a sudden there was just one. And his name is Dean. And Dean for the next like three years ran infomercial success for three years and everyone else is like infomercials don't work anymore. No one's buying real estate, the markets crash like, yeah, Dean, not only did he keep doing it, he succeeded and he thrived. He had his best years during this whole crash. And I asked him, I was like, what's the difference? Like, how come you got destroyed? And you didn't. He said, because every other infomercial was telling people was selling them towards pleasure. He's like, I changed my infomercial, I made a new one. And my infomercial was was was showing how my product, my service is a life preserver in times of economic uncertainty. I help people get out of pain. Boom, same product, different marketing message. 50 at 49 other people didn't didn't get it and they got destroyed and demolished and Dean survived and thrived. Okay, so understanding that like, how did the product and service that you sell, how do you can you repackage it in a way where it's getting people out of pain as opposed to moving them towards pleasure? And in about two years from now when the economy rebounds, things shift back like they always do, that's when you transition message again now, now people are out of pain. Now, how do I transition to move them towards pleasure? And that's when you'll see the huge lifts and growth in your companies. All right, that's it from Instagram. You guys ready? We're moving over to LinkedIn. Here we go. LinkedIn, Mike Wolpert. I've been, I've been concentrating on what's next living in the moment and long range vision. Wait, I've been concentrating on what's next living the moment and long range vision aren't so useful right now. What can we do next to get ready for the recovery and the emerging new world of business? We all kind of need to do something. Love to hear your take on that. All right, Mike, great question. I was listening to Simon Sinek this morning talk to his team about stuff and the videos and kind of floating around so you can probably find online, but it was interesting he was talking to his team. He's like, this isn't new. He's like, this stuff happens all the time. Obviously, the corona thing was faster than we thought and more severe than we thought, but this happens all the time, right? Where things get demolished and you start understanding it's not that money disappears. I think there's some false conception like, oh, the money's gone. We're all screwed. It's like, no, no, no, money's still there. In fact, there's gonna be more. I think the government's dumping like two trillion dollars. I don't watch the news if I heard two trillion dollars in the economy. So more money is getting dumped into here, right? So there's money. It's not disappearing. The money's you have to understand more in a time of wealth transfer, right? We're well, wealth is gonna be transferring to people, different people. And so those who understand that are gonna get that money transferred to them and those who don't are gonna lose their money and it's gonna be transferred away from them. And so I think it's still planning for the long term. It's not that we need to stop thinking about what's next and plan for all those kind of things, but it's understanding like right now we're in the greatest wealth transfer probably of all time. More people will become financially hugely rich during the next couple of years than ever before in history, right? You look at all the biggest companies that are the biggest companies today, the brands today, they came out during the Great Depression. The big tech companies and all know about today all came out during the last recession, right? Like this is the time to be growing. This is the best time to be planning and strategy. What's next? How can I serve people right now? But you've got to shift. It's not like how do I do the thing I did before better? The shift is in what is the new thing I'm gonna be doing? How do I serve people in this new world? Because the world's changed and it's not going back, right? We literally were about to close in an office space. I think they were trying to sell this for like 15 or $20 a square feet and the guy came back last week and said, I'll give you for five bucks a square feet, right? Nope, not worth it, right? Like a lot of businesses are done. Like now we're like, we work from home. This is actually great. Like why do we have all these offices? I can cut my, I can cut, you know, a million dollars a year off my my budget by getting all the offices. I don't need it now. We can do these things, right? Like it's not how do we get back to where things were. It's like looking at what the world's shifted, sweet. Now, how do I prepare myself? How do I create products and businesses in this new economy? Right? That's the shift we guys are making. Next, I'm from LinkedIn. I'm from Joel. Said I'm a student graduating May 2nd, no ceremony anymore. I haven't been able to find any jobs for then. All of my leads have dried up. So it looks like I'm going to be starting my own business. Congratulations. This is great for you. I have, I have a model set. I've been building and optimizing LinkedIn profiles for individuals and digital job search. This is something I've done as a freelancer for a while, but I haven't taken full time before. All right. I made good news for you guys. Okay. A lot of you guys could have been way more successful, but the problem was you were super comfortable. Yep. I just said it. You've been really comfortable. You had a good job. You're like, and you guys read the book, the book, good to great. If not, he starts a book saying the good is the enemy to great. Most people don't have a great marriage because they got a good marriage. Most people have a great business. They got a good business. Most people don't have a great life because they got a good life. Right? And I think for the last decade, for a lot of you guys, it's been good. And so you're like, yeah. And right now you just got good taken away from you. Right? And now it's like, you got to do something. Like the pain just got amplified. Like you have pressure, you got leverage now to do something amazing. And as crappy as it is for a lot of people, like I started this whole thing talking about bankruptcy, a lot of people even go through bankruptcy. It sucks. But guess what? It's going to be enough pain now, enough leverage to actually create something. Okay. Cause good just got taken away. If you want to create something great, now you got leveraged to actually do it. So for you, congratulations, Joel and pump for you, man. I'm so glad that your job is all dried up. Cause guess what? You got a job, you're sitting on the next 30 years of your life miserable, doing something to somebody else. And now you got an opportunity to do something good, but do something great. And now is the best time in the world. Like sharpen your saw, sharpen your skills at doing LinkedIn pages for people is amazing. Become the best in the freaking world of that. Become the like, so anybody on planet earth is like, I need a LinkedIn page. Like, well, she got a higher Joel. He's the best in the world. Like that's what you got to be looking at. Don't be like, I want to be good at this. I want to be like, no, become great. This is your window. This is your chance. Okay. You are, you have been given such a huge gift you don't even know right now. And you're freaking out thinking it's a, it's a curse, but it is not. It is a gift for all of us who are listening for anybody who will pick it up. It is a gift. And they say in the scriptures, many are called and fewer chosen, right? We've all been called. You've all heard, but very few are chosen. Why are they not chosen? Because they don't pick it up. So my challenge to you guys all, to Joel, but for everybody's listening is it's time to pick it up. Okay. You've been too comfortable for too long. This is the greatest thing that happens to you. It's forcing you to get leverage on yourself. Forcing you to finally read the book, to finally figure out click funnels. It's been insane. The last two weeks, we used to get 15,000 people a day signing into click funnels. Right now we're over 30,000 people a day, twice as many people to log in every day. And I'm like, all right, I've had this account for years. I've been paying the bills. I haven't logged in yet. And like now I got to, I got to finally log in. Right? Okay. Now they got some, they got some leverage. They got some pain. And so the best thing for entrepreneurs is pain. When we turn up that pain, it gets us to work. So you've been comfortable too long. So look at this as a blessing because it is. All right. Let's see. Where are we at? Wait, is that the end? What? Tell you all of them, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Holy Moly. We did it. You guys. How do you guys like to RQ&A today? Was that fun? All right. I want to do something. You guys, you guys are cool. If I do this real quick. I started with this quote, but I want to read it one more time just because I think it, it's what I just want to end cap it with this. I've read this like 10 times. I've read twice to you guys right now. I'm going to read it one more time and we're going to wrap for the day. Is that sound cool? All right. So again, this is a quote from CS Lewis in 1948. You're talking about the A bomb. I'm going to replace a bomb with coronavirus. And this is my, my, my closing thoughts for you guys. I want you to hear it. I want you to feel it. I want you guys to understand it. And I don't want to break three from all the fear and start moving forward. If you need more of this, you guys start back in the very beginning. I shared some stuff very beginning talking about looking at the worst case scenario and understanding and becoming okay with it. All the things you need to break your fears so you can move forward. If you missed it, start back over and we're going to get done off the live and go listen to that part of the game because it'll help you. But this is a quote from CS Lewis during the 1948 in the middle of the atom bomb scare where everyone's freaked out and everyone's frozen at home. It's not leaving. They don't want to get blown up by an atom bomb. And this is what the man CS Lewis said. I'm going to replace atom bomb with coronavirus so that it's more applicable to all of us. I'm going to liken this to you so you understand it for yourself. In one way, we think a great deal too much of the coronavirus. How are we supposed to live in a, in a, in a viral age? I'm intended to say why is you have lived in, uh, why, as you would have lived in the 16th century when the plague visited London almost every year, or as you would have lived in the Viking age when the Raiders from Scandinavia might land and cut your throat any night, or indeed as you already live in an age of cancer and age of syphilis and age of paralysis and age of air raids and age of railroad accidents, uh, uh, age of motor accidents. In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Let me say that again. Uh, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir or madam, you and all of them, um, you love were already sentenced to death before the coronavirus was ever invented and quite a high percentage of us are going to die in unpleasant ways. We had indeed one very great advantage over our ancestors and aesthetics, but we have that still. It is perfectly ridiculous to go about whimpering and drawing long faces because the scientists have added one more chance of painful and premature death to a world which already bristled with such chances in which death itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty. This is the first point to be made. And the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we're going to be destroyed by the coronavirus, let that virus come, uh, when it comes, find us doing sensible and human things, praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, baiting the children, playing tennis, chatting with our friends over a pint in a game of darts, not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about the virus. They may break our bodies. Microbe can do that, but they will not dominate our minds. Oh, so good. C.S. Lewis, you are the man. Anyway, thanks you guys. I appreciate. Hopefully, uh, this helped today. I had a good time. If you missed anything, uh, definitely start, start back at the beginning. I talked to at the very beginning about some stuff I think is really powerful about, um, understanding the worst case scenario, becoming okay with it. So it'll unlock the fear so you can move forward. Some of you guys right now are locked in fear. If we don't break that, um, you're going to crumble underneath the pressure of it. Okay. It's not a time to be fearful. It's time to have to be okay with the worst case scenario. Look at the face, be like, I'm in. Let's go and then start running. Um, again, if you missed that, when this video ends, you can go back from the very beginning, push, play and start going through it. Uh, thanks you guys again for hanging out today. I appreciate you all. I'm going to go play with my kids. We're going to go do some fun stuff for the next 25 hours until they pass out, which I'm excited for. I got the energy for it. So thanks you guys. I appreciate you all and have an amazing weekend. Bye everybody.
