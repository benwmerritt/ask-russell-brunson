The epiphany goes off in your mind when you do a million dollars a day. You think to yourself, what have I been doing with like all the other days of my life? Today I'm here with one of my close friends, Eileen Wilder, and she's done not once but twice now, which is making a million dollars in a day. Because the clients, they just want the end result. So they don't care if it's 6,000, 30,000, they're like, can you help me? As soon as we did that, 34 people came right in and that was it. I kept increasing my conviction is what I call it, like almost every couple phone calls. So I would be like selling the same package I was for $297 at 6K within a couple weeks. Yeah, I take it, makes it go faster, not selling one to one, but selling one to many will also make it go faster. So now it's like I'm having one sales conversation, but I'm having it with 20, 40, 100, 200 people. Somebody paying me for knowledge, that was like... When I got first started in this business, people that talk about numbers like that, that wasn't a thing that we even shot towards or tried. And I remember the very first time, the very first person in our, this industry, was a guy named John Reese, he made a million dollars in a day. And I remember I was like a 22 or 23 year old kid when I heard that. And for me, it was like somebody had broken the 4-minute mile. You guys have heard the story about Roger Bannister, and everyone says, impossible, break the 4-minute mile. Then Roger Bannister broke it, and then like 20 days later, something else broke, and now it's been like 2,000 or 3,000 people have broken it since then. And I remember for me when John Reese broke a million dollar day, it was like that's what gave me belief that it was possible. And so my goal with this video is Eileen's here, she's done it not once now, but twice. And just a few years ago, you were new to this whole, where this is like not something, this is not like, she's been doing this for 40 years now, she's finally got to the point, like this is something that's newer for you. And so my goal with everyone who's watching this is that I want this to be the 4-minute mile. I want you guys setting this as like a goal and intention. I'm like, oh this is impossible, it's never gonna happen, but the reason why it was powerful for me is when John Reese did it, I was like, I'm gonna do that, I've got to figure out a way to do it. And so my goal for you guys is to like, is to hear this, and then like set that as an intention and goal, like I got to figure out a reverse engineer and actually do that. So that's it Eileen, thanks for coming to hang out with me today, I'm excited. Fun. When you like, I want to tie it, like people timeline, like when did you transition to like, you're gonna become a speaker, and these kind of things, how long ago was that? About four years ago, I came to your event, and up until that time, I actually was in nonprofit ministry, so I was a pastor for 18 years, but a friend of mine said, you have to come to Funnel Hacking Live, and I was like, what's that? And she's like, it's a marketing event, I was like, cool, what's marketing? I didn't understand anything about sales or really like the internet, I had just been a preacher and a pastor, and been speaking all over the world, but we weren't making a lot of money in the nonprofit ministry. So we sat in the back of your event, and started hearing about things like offers, like, I don't know, you were just reusing new words, like contribution, and teaching, and treating, and online, and my eyes just felt like, and then you had a bunch of people come up and they get awards for doing a million dollars and doing even more than that, and I was just like, what is happening right now? I am so confused, but this is amazing. It was like a rock concert, but it felt like Disney World, but we're like making millions of dollars, and I was like, whatever this is, I would love this please. So you learned about it, and then it's initially because a lot of people come into our world, who go to the bed and they go back home and nothing ever happens, but for you, you went and took action very quickly. I know you made a video of those little jankies, I want to hear that part of the story, it's fascinating. Yeah, well you got up and you were like, listen guys, this is what you need to do, you need to make an offer, and I was like, sweet, what is an offer? And then you like mapped it out, and you're like, it's like packaging up your expertise and your knowledge of this thing, I was like, that's all I was saying. I still didn't know how to do that or what that looked like exactly, but I was so excited from the event, and you were like, you can do this, and I was like, I can do this. I just, like, this is what brought, I just believed, and went home and made a janky video in my two bedroom apartment. I turned the camera, my iPhone, so you couldn't see my bed, and... It was like getting your actual bedroom. Oh yeah, 100%. Yeah, I still have it, and it's so bad, and it's just two minutes long, but it's my first attempt at like, hey guys, if you'd be interested in this thing, and I'm super awkward, and it was a terrible video, but I put it out on social media, I was just messaging friends, and sure enough, people were showing interest, and then I got on the phone with them, and I started selling, making money. So you first saw me sell somebody something. How was that? Because I'm sure you never... No, I never, I had never taken... I had never, what the big thing for me was, somebody paying me for knowledge that was in my head. That was like... I mean, I tried to, when someone said yes, I remember I sold it for $297, I tried to act like, so cool. It was like, it's only $297. And they were like, I'm in, I was like... I mean, I was like, are you sure? Because it's in my head. But that process was just transformative for me, because it was the very beginning of seeing that other people will pay other people for tips, training, knowledge, expertise, shortcut the process for them, and I was like, it just started making sense for them, and for me, and I got excited, and I just kept going on the phone, kind of selling those offers and increasing the price, and that's when we just, yeah. So we'll talk about the pricing, because I'm a big math, like reverse engineer math, so I remember one day sitting down when I was trying to figure out how am I gonna make a million dollars? My first goal was a million dollars a year. I didn't set it per day, how do I do that? So I reverse engineered, I remember I was like, a million dollars, I buy it by 365, and the number, I'm not doing the number off top yet. This is my favorite number. $2739.73 a day, every day for a year is a million dollars. So I was like, okay, $2739.73. How do I make $2700 a day, basically? And so I remember back then, you probably heard my story, I made a potato gun DVD and I started selling that, I was making like 20 bucks a day on that. So I was like, okay, I've got one thing making 20 bucks a day, and I got another thing, so I started creating all these different funnels, trying to, so eventually I had like 10 different businesses all making $10, like $30, then trying to get to that number. Interesting. And it was hard though, because I'm juggling now 20 different offers and stuff like that. So you went the opposite, you took 200, your offers $297, and then, and so the math is like, at $297, you have to sell 10 a day, every single day for a year to make a million dollars. Okay, good. But you didn't do that, so how did you, started increasing it? Okay, so once a wife friend, Jackie, who invited me to your event, she was like, listen, there's this thing called high ticket, and I was like, what's that? And she's like, it's not low ticket, it's a high ticket, and high ticket is way better because you can serve the clients at a higher level and like do all this cool stuff, and like hire a team, and they love it, but you also get a cash infusion. I was like, that sounds great, and sounds faster to me. That's the problem with people, you buy a $27 ebook from me, I can't, that's like, I can give it to you, and then that's kind of it. Yeah, yeah, 100%. She was like, and then we started studying even deeper, like that in many ways, that people are looking for a fast result, especially if they're trying to change their life, or maybe they're wrestling with something in their health, that they would just prefer to spend high ticket so they can get that result faster. So I was like, I can help people quickly, so let's just go that way. Did you go to like 297 and then just jumped it up, or did you kind of incrementally grow it over time? Yeah, so I kept increasing my conviction is what I call it, like almost every couple phone calls, so I would be like, okay, it's 297, and then I double it, and they'd be like, okay, it's 600, okay, it's 1200. I kept going like, 30, see you, I don't even know how to double the numbers, but like, I kept going until 4 or 6K, I think I stopped right there, and so I was selling the same package I was for 297 at 6K within a couple weeks, yeah, yeah, and that was awesome. That's crazy. I was like, what are you doing? I was like, I don't know, but it's like, it's working, and everyone was, the clients were loving it, and it was awesome. So cool. So now you got that part figured out, and then how did you, because going from there to Million Dollar's Day, like what was the transition? Now I'm on the phone all day, and I'm getting like tired, and then this is common for people who sell on the phone, or if they have a big sales team, and it just creates like, it's like a lot of things, and exhaustion. So then I learned, first about this from you, was selling one to many. So that idea, I was like, oh my gosh, so just like high ticket makes it go faster, not selling one to one, but selling one to many will also make it go faster. So now it's like I'm having one sales conversation, but I'm having it with 20, 40, 100, 200 people one time, and then they all hear it, and then they can all buy. So the first time I implemented that, I had a small room, it was actually I had like a small little ballroom, no, it was not even a ballroom, it was a very small room with 12 people in it, and I did my presentation one to many, and I closed six. Half of them bought. Half of them bought, and that day I did like 108,000 in one day. This was my first six figure day, so I was like, and I turned to my husband, he was like still Uber driving to support us, and I was like, this is it. You can quit. I was like, it's high ticket, and it's one to many, it's the fastest path. So we just quickly figured out how to do the numbers so you could do a million dollars in a day. Yeah, cool. With this, we said that I remember my very first six figure day was similar. My price point was only $2,000, but I was in a room about 500 people, and then suddenly I spoke, and people ran the back, and they bought. There was the same thing, one presentation for 500 people, and then I think I did 180,000 in sales, and I was just like, and I remember because you know, Brett Coppeter's on my team. Yeah. Brett had just started working with me. I met him in college, and so he didn't understand this world at all, and he was there, and I remember getting off stage, and I was just like, I can't believe we did this. And he's like, you made more in 90 minutes than my parents making a year, then people, teachers making five years. You just couldn't fathom that. And I was like, we're so used to thinking about trading dollars for time. So I make $50 an hour, $100 an hour, and that's awesome. It's like, you know, again, now high ticket. You go from one to one, you make $10,000 an hour, and then you go one to many, and it's like, the sky is the limit. Okay, so then let's transition out to your very first million dollar deal. What did that look like? What was the setup like? What was- Yep, yep, yep. So one of the cool things was just learning how to make high ticket offers, like learning the skill set of offer creation. So I was like, okay, I can make kind of a $6,000 offer. Like, what would it look like if I made a $30,000 offer? And I think to do a million dollars in a day, I think it's like 34 sales at $30K puts you over a million dollars. So I was like, okay, I stayed to get enough people in the room where I could sell 34 people at this $30,000. So we just kind of reverse engineered how many people would need to be in the room to sell 34. Because when we did that, I learned that even if you're selling at those higher price points, like, it's really just the same thing. Like, it's like, because the clients, they just want the end result. So they don't care if it's $6,000 or $30,000. They're like, can you help me? You know what I mean? You're like, yes, I can 100% help you. So soon as we did that, yeah, 34 people came right in and that was it. Like, and then, I mean, it's funny now numbers start to feel funnier at this point in time. But the epiphany goes off in your mind when you do a million dollars in a day, you think to yourself, what have I been doing with like all the other days of my life? What have I been focusing on? Or what am I focusing on in my business that isn't collecting people in a room to present an offer like this? Like, it just doesn't make sense really. Yeah. So often we get caught up in all the little, all the busy things or things like, oh, there's this problem, this problem, this and that. And I have a very similar situation where like, there's probably four days a year where I make the majority of my money. Wow. And then the other 365, like, I don't know what I'm doing. Like, you know, I'm doing a lot of stuff, but, you know, and I obviously see all our part of it is building audiences to buy that. But it's like, there are definitely times where it's like, these actions are what makes the most amount of money. Like, how do we engineer and have those more often inside of our business? I'm curious now for that offer, for the $30,000 offer, how often do you offer that right now? Are there certain times that all the time is it? Right now, we probably offer it once a month because now we have it like evergreen. So it's just like once a month that we're offering that. And I've learned because sometimes it stresses people out like, well, what's in the $30,000 offer? You know, that sounds like that's going to be so hard to deliver on that. But it's really not. Like there's so many lightening. It's just what leverage happens at so many points in business. So it's like, to me, leverage is like, let's just make this offer more often. So let's make this once a month. Once, yeah, once a month. And let's not offer a 12 month or super long program. Let's just like make a $30,000 workshop. So then we just deliver it like that. So it's like time compression in every facet. Yeah. It's so cool. It's funny because I'm sure people watch this right now. Like one of the things, when I got this role, I thought high tick was one thing. Like, in fact, for me, like $5,000, my first cause I think that's high tick. That's the most expensive. So my first offer is $5,500. I remember that was your first offer. First high ticket offer that you bought or you sold? Okay. And I remember that I joined Dan Kennedy's mastermind group and I go to the mastermind group and everyone had a chance to present their business. So I presented mine. I'm like, I have a free DVD. People buy it. We call them with a phone. We sell $5,500 thing. Yeah. And I remember Bill Glazer asked me, he's like, well, what do you sell to people who bought $5,500 offer? I was like, what do you mean? Like they gave me all their money. Like that's it. That's the end of the thing. That's what was possible. He says, no, you don't understand. You have a $5,500 buyer there. Like that person wants to do more money. I didn't understand it. Now, to put in perspective, I had paid, I think $18,000 to be in that mastermind. And then that night of the mastermind, Bill Glazer got up and he presented this documentary that they make called the Phenomenon. And for $30,000, you could be interviewed in the Phenomenon. And there's 18 of us in the room and nine of the 18 people gave him $30,000. And I was like, I'm an $18,000 buyer. I didn't even understand that. And like it blew my mind. Like I remember like my whole world's shit draws like I thought $5,000 was the peak, right? And I saw like I had paid 18 worst of that was now the new peak. And then the people with 18 half of them paid 30 and he kept raising. And so I want to just for those who were still like hard to grasp this, even like some of you guys said $30,000, you're like, that's impossible. That's what I make in a year. And if you can't fathom it, but I want to set this bar even higher. You have a $250,000 offer. And people give you money for $250,000. And the fulfillment is not like you come and work for them for the next 10 years of your life. It's a one day thing, right? Like talk about just how you have the mentality. Like I'm going to try a whole year above it. Yes. Yes. Well, you know, it's so cool is like the more you raise your prices, the easier everything becomes. Like the client is more amazing than you've ever thought possible. The work is less than you ever imagined possible. And just the entire experience is feels effortless. So when I grasp the fact that people will pay whatever it is like that you could possibly imagine as long as you can get them the result. So if I can make someone a million dollars and you've made like 40 billion, bajillion millionaires, like if I could help someone else make a million dollars, they would gladly trade me $250,000,000 for that million dollars. So that's the thing. It's like, I'm not going to work 10 years. It's like, I can help you get this result in one day. Like you can. So it's like, let's just, hey, wouldn't it, hey, this would be more fun if we just like didn't talk for 12 months, but we just like hung out for one day. You know what I mean? It's like, that sounds way more fun. It doesn't even require a lot of logic. You're just like, yep, I could totally help you make a million dollars. So I'll take your 250 and I'll trade you a million dollars. And then they often get more than a million dollars. So I think it's just the exchange of value and how not to be afraid. You know, I forget what Dan Kennedy calls it, but it's like price elasticity. And he's like elasticity and he has to price cowardice. He also talks about being cowardly. And so it's just not being afraid to raise your prices and even put more value on the work that you're providing people and not be afraid of that. Yeah. It is fascinating to like, I look at, you know, we have programs every step along the way and like the people that sign up for a free trial or for a, you know, $27 offer a free book typically are harder clients than the person who spent $50,000, $150,000, $250,000, which is interesting. Yep. And so by even looking and starting with high ticket, you bypassed a lot of the stress and headaches and things like that. Right. The client or the person is willing or willing or able to write you a $30,000 check. Yep. They're a different caliber than someone who's not. So it's like, they're not as needy. They're not as like, they've gone through the personal development to get the point where they can write a check at that point. And so you don't have to do a lot of the heavy lifting of like, you know, where someone bought a book for $7 off a free plus shipping offer and I'm trying to help them understand, no, you actually can build a funnel. It's not that hard or you can like share your story and, you know, and it's, it's, it's interesting. High ticket clients are the best. Yeah. The best. You actually enjoy it. I mean, you really, yeah, you're like, really, let's hang out. Like there's so much fun. I see a client see it. So there you go. So you four years ago got started. You launched a $297 high ticket offer and another one, another one, $2 billion days, $250,000 offers. Like what's next for you? Where are you going from here? Well, my goal is to scale to $100 billion. That's my goal. But while we're working less than part time. So I love leverage. I love space. I love time. I love high ticket and I love selling one to many because it enables you to hit whatever it is that, you know, your goal is, but still have so much freedom of time and family and fun. So that's my goal. So cool. If you don't want to watch you as you're doing this goal, where's the best place for the goal? Oh, you and the journey. Yeah. Speakingschool.com. I have a free toolkit where you can learn all the stuff that I'm talking about. High ticket offer, selling from stage. So cool. So yeah, speakingschool.com. Thanks for hanging out with us today. And you guys can do it. I link and do a million dollar a day twice. And if I can have six, like, you guys can do this. The biggest key is just like believing it's actually possible for you. And at first, you know, your abilities might not be there yet, which is why it's like you have to start on this process, start on this path. Like Eileen had to sell a $297 offer before she was she felt capable to do the next one and the next one, but it's just like getting on the process and the path. And as you do it, your skillset will increase. Your capacity will get bigger and you'll get better and better. And honestly, this guy's the limit. So thank you for being such a cool example of all that and setting the goal for everybody else to go and hit their million dollar a day as well.
