What's up everybody this is Russell and welcome to today's episode of marketing secrets that is in the rain here in Kauai All right everybody so I want to welcome you guys to today's episode of marketing secrets It is raining on me right now All right, so what I wanted to share with you guys I've been listening to a whole bunch of cool marketing stuff between like the long drives around the island all kind of the cool stuff We're doing and the course I was listening to is TJ roll letter TJ if you're on TJ he's like one of the legends in our business He is the one of the direct male Kings. What's interesting is the course I was listening to is like how to become super rich in the opportunity market But what's interesting is I was listening to it You read the expert secrets book you're talking about there's three core things You got to do to have build a mass movement right number one number one you had to have The attractive character the charismatic leader number two to have future-based cause number three you have to have new opportunity What's interesting as I was listening to this he's talking about like how to sell opportunities But like basically if you're doing a mass movement way we're talking about like it's always a new opportunity like the opportunities The way he kind of positions them are like how to get rich how to make money how like here's the opportunity market He calls it but in my mind every market's the opportunity market if you look at through the lens of the expert secrets book then it Kind of works for all of them right every single opportunity everything you're selling should be a new opportunity I'm the last ten years. They sent out nine like 9,500 Different direct male campaigns, which is crazy. He says some people will get on his list And they make it between two and three hundred letters in the mail per year depending on what sequence they take what offers It's a yes to a no to and all sorts of stuff What I want to talk about is a couple of the core things that I learned From him that he grew really good for all you guys in fact the first one's actually not from TJ It was from a bill Glazer thing. I was listening to you so bill was Partners with Dan Kennedy at Glacier Kennedy and he was like my my marketing dad for man five or six years I was in his inner circle this week bill was talking about how like the very beginning of the year They know that they're big things right so they did two events here They did info summit and super conference for me I do for hacking lives like that's my big thing and they said that they they categorized all their promotions based on the importance So number one were there two events number two was this number three And then they had it all mapped out and then they mapped out the entire year the promotional schedule at the beginning Of year to make sure they filled the events and I was thinking about that like I don't know about you guys But I'm not super good at mapping out my promotional calendar and schedule and things like that I kind of just like go week by week month by month and do stuff and what bill does he maps it out And then they do see everything and so I started thinking about this as you guys know if you've been listening to our podcast for any Like the time you know the two magic things that marketers have are urgency and scarcity So he started doing his is you really launched different courses throughout the year and they'd open them and close them right so they can have the Urgency and scarcity close that's where most of the cells always come in I started thinking about that I'm like man I like right now most of our programs are open all the time which is good But the urgency and scarcity is not there So I was like I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start calendaring it out where twice a year our things are available So twice a year by our certification program twice a year people can join funnel University twice a year Then get fill your funnel twice a year So like all of our core offers are only open to twice during the year and they're closed down other than that Which is kind of fun because they'll have urgency and scarcity and build up the hype in the buzz and it gives me each month something to Focus on this month is funnel you month Okay, we're gonna open it and then close it the next month is this we're gonna open it and close it and all content all things Can be related back to that first thing I kind of sort of rethinking through Listen to Bill Glazier talk about how they structured the promotion around their events. That was that's first cool thing now with TJ A couple cool things that he does TJ again. He's in the business opportunity market mostly through direct mail And so he has 50,000 letters he mails every single week week in week out just consistently They know 50,000 letters go out every single week all for new customer acquisition. That's it And I think for a lot of us we get in this thing where we have our front-end funnels I break even phones remembering people in them. We have our monetization funnels I think a lot of us we create one really good webinar funnel Let's say and then that becomes our focus and and that's it and we're driving traffic and and that's like the business, right? I start thinking about that like man, he's milling 50,000 new names every single week Like what's the what's the equivalent that for my business? I need to make sure that I have something consistently doing that every single week to one front-end offer and he talked about One of the big things also is like he's not milling two different things or three things that 50,000 It's like they have one offer the hottest converting one and that's where they drive all their energy all their money all everything And so for us, I think all of us we have our hot offer We need to be spending as much as we can to get people into that thing consistently every single week Just knowing I spend 50 grand a week or 10 grand a week or thousand bucks a week Whatever it is for you into that front-end thing think about this if you break it down There's there's kind of two sides of this there's or three sides if you pay how deep you want to get there's acquisition funnels So getting people in there's ascension funnels of sending them up and within your your your membership and there's Monetization funnels, but for this argument for today. I'm just gonna talk about the two so there's acquisition funnels, right? So so what is your one acquisition funnel that you can consistently do X with right? So for me it might be I need to make sure I sell at least a thousand books a week or any of spend 10 grand a week or whatever That thing is for you, right? And like you just know that you get you have to do it consistently We have so thousand books a week and that we should build a whole team people an entire goal So thousand books a week or five thousand books or whatever that number is And so for me what I'm looking at is what I want my focus to be is Somebody comes in to my world and then if they come in then we're taking our core courses We're opening them and closing them opening and closing them opening and closing them throughout the year So those are our monetization funnels after people come in that's kind of it's kind of the game and I'm really excited for it So that's the game. I'm gonna be playing and I hope you guys model that so those are some of fun things I learned and thinking about while I've been here having some fun in Kauai on my 15 year anniversary So kind of to recap the important things number one is focusing on consistently bringing new blood into your business Then number two is and after they come in then what's the monetization? So maybe number two is the ascension funnel Which is for me to not ignite your funnel takes them through our offers in a chronological order of where I want them to see things Opening and closing on like an evergreen format and they end that then put them into our Monetization team monetization funnels which would then be taking our core six offers and opening and closing them twice a year And that's gonna be the business make it's been really excited really really excited That's the game plan guys things again for listening an amazing day We'll see you guys soon. We'll be back in boys the next week back to normal schedule I got some cool stuff on publish and share with you guys appreciate y'all and we'll see you guys soon You
