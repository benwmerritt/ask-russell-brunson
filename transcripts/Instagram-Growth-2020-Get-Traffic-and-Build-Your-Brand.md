Where are we going? Burgers. Burgers. For breakfast. Unami burger. Apparently a close second to In-N-Out burger. But you don't like In-N-Out burger? No. Why? If you don't have it, I'm all excited. I'm like, you know, like, oh, it's like an okay burger, I guess. Alright, we're going to work for Infusionsoft. And all of you now feel like, oh, it's so magical. We're going to get the secret way that nobody knows except for everybody. You say animal style and they make you different. Oh, it tastes like there's some fry sauce or some Thousand Island on it now. Alright. Lead pages, are you hiring? What are your thoughts about In-N-Out burgers? I don't know if it's the right time for me to say this. No, because I've always... In-N-Out is more of a cult thing for Southern California. It's not like the best burger, but it's the experience. Yeah, that doesn't look like a Burger King burger. No, no, no, no. Not even close. No, no, no, no. He's not even close to Burger King. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. You kidding me? This is amazing. No, no, no. That's like leagues apart. You can either wrestle in high school or you can wrestle in college. What do you choose, Blaze? Now what do you... WWF wrestling? Jack in the Box? You're comparing that to wrestling? Jack in the Box has got the best breakfast sound. That's why they specialize only in burgers. I will give you the Arbiter than McDonald's. The Lester County, the McGriddles, then it's like, I can't compare breakfast to lunch and dinner. That's not even the same meal. Do you want an orange or an apple? I don't know. I'm stressed out. I can't take any of that. It's as good as an Elf or something. You guys like Dave's parking job? That's why he just charged him $11 because he actually took up two spots. Literally right in the middle. I'll re-park it. That's your four spots. Oh my gosh. Just let it go. Let it go. If you want to know how to get Spiky Pork Chop to your website and your funnel, go to books.com right now. Or if you want to free top, go to Traffasix.com. You can go to the website. Brand new book, Traffasix.com. I've always got the bookstore made like 500 ads. Now we're jumping in the car because I'm on stage in one minute at some Proovit thing that we just found out about. And I'm talking about, we don't know. We're in California. So what is a key film? It's like tons of little motivational speakers running through your body. Are you ready? My books are... Oh, thank you. My third book just got done. It's called Traffic Secrets, but it's all about how to get traffic and leads and people into your world. And so I was thinking like, what would be the best thing from this book that I could share with you guys to help give you some help getting more people? How many of you need more people to talk to? Alright. How many of you guys are on Facebook or Instagram or any kind of social platform? How many of you guys have tons of success socially on these platforms getting new leads coming to your business? Okay, I went from like 100% to like 0.0005%. And the reason I'm guessing is most of you guys are on here and you're like, okay, we're going to the party. We're going to go get these people all signed up. It's going to be so much fun. Every single one of my friends. I see this all the time. My friends will like join something and they come in. I'll see them for two months. Every post on Facebook or Instagram is selling the thing, selling, selling, selling, selling, selling. And then you never hear from them again, right? So I want to give you guys a tool that will hopefully help you as you're socially going out there. That will get people to actually want to come to you. And I'm the kind of person who's scared of going and talking to people. So I want to do stuff to get people to come to me. And if I can do that, it changes everything, right? It's attraction versus like chasing, okay? And so in the book, there's a chapter here on Instagram. Most of the stuff that I learned in here is from one of my friends, Jenna Kutcher. She is one of the most amazing social people ever. She said, okay, most people, if you look at their Instagram wall or Facebook, whatever, they're very one-dimensional, right? Like I'm a business person. It's all my posts about business, right? Or I'm a fitness person. So I'm, you know, here's a thousand pictures of me showing off my six pack abs. Or here's me. Like these have their thing, right? And their wall or whatever is just coded in this thing. And so the problem with that is then you become a very one-dimensional type person. So that one kind of person will come follow you. But everybody else is like, oh, that person's kind of a whatever, fill in the blank, but everyone call him, right? If you look at Instagram, you guys have logged in Instagram, you see this thing. What's this thing called? Do you guys know? It's called a grid. So if someone looks at your grid and if they see nine pictures of you holding your ketone drink, like flexing while, like flexing your abs, are you drinking and flexing? Anyway, this is a really one-dimensional person. And the people who are in prove it will be like, this person's awesome. Yeah. And they're being friends with you and they're going to listen to everything you say. They're going to like, they're going to comment. But anybody else in your world around you who decides to come follow you is going to be like, this person's really weird, right? You're going to be your kid's soccer game and you're going to introduce yourself to one of the parents, the parents can find you on Instagram, they're going to follow you and be like, oh no, stay with that person. That person, all they care about is this one thing, right? So what Jen had said that she recommended is she said, you got to figure out in your life, there's five categories. You got to figure out five categories of things that are really, really important to you. Okay? And she says, what you do is you do that and then on your phone, you make albums. She calls us the JK5 and it stands for five categories. So you pick five categories of things that you're really passionate about in your life. This is going to make you a super multi-dimensional human being. And so everyone picks five. I wrote down my five here so I can see. The five things that mean the most to me are my family, funnels, faith, entrepreneurship and personal development. So the way it works is throughout the days when you take pictures of stuff, you take pictures with your family, you save them all on an album here that's called your family album. As you're walking around and you're at an event like this and you've got your ketone drinks, you take a bunch of pictures and this is me with my ketones, right? So maybe ketones is one of yours. And then you get one that's maybe faith stuff, so maybe it's church or maybe it's working out or maybe it's whatever your things are, right? You pick five categories of things that are really important to you. And throughout the day, you go and you take pictures and you're putting them into these different picture albums right here. Then every day you have a shot, whether on Facebook or Instagram, whatever you're doing, you're going to go and you're going to make a post. One post per day and what you're going to do is you're going to pick one of these five categories. So let's say the first one's family. You take a picture of your family, you post this picture of your family, people are like oh look at that, they're so cute, the beautiful wife and the kids and they see your family, right? And then what happens is there's people in your real world who will see you, people who go to church, people who are your kids soccer practice, whatever they come in, they see this thing all of a sudden they're like oh this is, he's a family person, that's exciting, they connect with that part of your personality, right? And they will follow you because that's who they care about, they care about you as the family person, right? Then you pick your second thing. Like for me funnels is one, right? So I'll have me doing, building a funnel for somebody or something. Maybe it's me building the funnel for Tony Robbins or for Brian. The next day I picked the third one which maybe is faith. So I'll have a picture, like recently, Clett and I went to Fiji on Sunday, there was no Mormon church close, so we went to Pentecostal church, which was so much fun. And the preacher was up on stage and he's preaching from the Bible and he's like who wants to come up here and preach with me? And I'm like alright, so I come up on stage, I'm with the dude and we're preaching from the thing and Clett got a picture of it and I post the thing right there of me and the Pentecostal preacher up here talking about faith. I'm like I don't believe everything he believes, but man he was passionate. I felt the spirit with him was amazing, the experience, so grateful for him and his love of God, grateful that I had a chance to be with him and his congregations people. Posted that, right? So it's a faith thing. And then over here I picked the next one and the next one. And then at the end of five I start back over the very beginning and I post a family picture. And then the next one, and the next one, I keep doing that, right? And what's going to happen is in your life as you were going out there and you were networking and you're getting to know people and you're going to do different parties. Parties like this, parties at school, parties at church, parties at different places. People will start to get to know you, they're going to start following you and they're going to connect with this part of your life. And if you're not careful, if your whole wall is just this part of your life or something completely different, they're not going to connect with you. But they say, man, I keep seeing Russell with his family, with his kids and he seems so happy, I see him at church, I see him at different places. And every five or six posts he talks about this drink he has, this getting him in health and making him in shape. Like what is that? And now that person from church is going to ask me like what's that thing you keep talking about? I keep saying to you, man, you are happy in this back, all these things put together in your life, you're happy in all these different aspects. What's that one? I want to know more about that. So I've used this in my life and it's been amazing because I've had more conversations about my faith than I ever would have dreamt of in a million years prior. Because people who follow me in business would be like, hey, you were at a Pentecostal church, I thought you were Mormon, I thought you guys don't like. And I was like, no, we're Christians. I explained that, I have a chance to open up a conversation, I can talk about that. People who go to school with my kids, they'll follow me. In fact, my 14 year old son has a little girlie friend that he's kind of flirting on him. And her mom started following me because she's doing the whole stock of the parents to make sure that the kid that's chasing my daughter is not creepy. And so she's been following me for the last three or four months and I got a message from her two days ago saying, hey, so I run an insurance company. How would funnels work for an insurance company? Boom. Because she saw me with my kids. Man, he's a good dad. Man, he goes to church. Man, he's in health. Man, these are things all of a sudden it's like, what's that funnels thing I keep hearing and talking about? How would that work for me? And then they came to me. And if people see a full human being, then they start coming to you. They start asking you questions. And so that's what I do. That's my social sneaky trick. I don't go out there to the party and spam people like crazy and I go to parties and get to know people. And man, I tell you what, when I started doing this, the quality of my life went up. It became so much more fun. Every day I wake up in the morning, I'm like, what should I post? I'm so excited. What's the best picture I can take? So anyway, that's something I thought would be valuable for you guys because I see so many people in this community, but most communities I go into, that this they're using is like, this is my spot to come in here and spam my links out and try to get people to buy my stuff. And I promise you if you're doing that and you're struggling, that's why. Become a rounded, I mean we're all very well rounded human beings. I show that and that'll get people to attract you. Most people aren't going to join your opportunity because they think the comp plan is the best thing in the world. They're going to join the opportunity because you got your head put together. You've got a good family life. You're making money. You're having success. You're healthy. Those are the things that are going to attract people to you to get them to come ask you about it. Hope you guys enjoyed it. Thank you guys so much for becoming Hangouts. You guys, thank you. The first five people who would run in the back of the room will give you free key tones for life. Just kidding. I don't even know. I asked Brian if I could sell something else I'm used to doing, but I'm not allowed to. Just kidding. I'm done-ish. I can go keep going.
