I literally had a Fusionsoft, I had lead pages, I had WordPress, married up with Optimize Press and I had Kajabi and I had figured out how to duct tape it all together. I'm literally every day hoping that the duct tape I had used to hold the shit together wouldn't fall apart between membership sites and sales pages and sales funnels and integrated funnels and stacking funnels and I get a message from one of my clients and he says, dude I've been checking out this thing called ClickFunnels. How can I do this? I had built a bunch of businesses, I had lost all those businesses, I was in the home, my wife was leaving me. I'm leaving and I'm taking the kids. The Wikipedia Boyer is the number one training company in the world for married businessmen. We assist and guide businessmen to accessing deeper levels of power through a gamified system known as the Warriors Way that they play on their phones and compete with a way of living and operating with men all over the globe. The man you will have become day by day, step by step, laying the foundation for the king and the kingdom and the throne that awaits you. They take that power and then link that up to what we call Warrior Wealth which is the ability for man to actually increase his production to 3X while at the same time bringing his marriage, his spirituality, his children, his fitness and his body along for the ride. So at the end of the day we are comprehensive consultants. We deal with businessmen only we deal with the part of life as well as the business side that actually affects production. And so we went all in and we were the first ones to switch over and put all of our emails. We dropped infusion soft and I went directly, we were one of the first companies to integrate 100% of all of our contacts into the email provider and email service inside of ClickFunnels. He told, I told Russell, I said I am all in on you. And this is what I did for us. And we started with Wake Up Warrior and then I built it out in my financial services companies and we took it out into our real estate space and we took it into our salons and now I have hundreds of stylists that use ClickFunnels who help get applications into their chair for clients now applying to be part of their experiences, hairstyles. My wife uses it, I use it. ClickFunnels is more than a software. It's a psychology. It's a way for operating. It's a way to influence, to persuade. It was like Apple had done to cell phones, ClickFunnels did to sales funnels and online digital assets for consultants and coaches. You get to have access to something. The guys like me never got in the beginning and that means your results are going to happen even faster if you're committed. Thousands and thousands and thousands of families in 27 countries participate and live and experience the Warriors way to having it all. Hundreds of emails every single week poured into our offices with families, divorces that were shut down and changed and marriages that were unified. The strange children who now speak to their fathers, men who have increased profitability and at the same time have found connection inside of their marriages and inside of their families in ways that they never dream possible but the greatest emails that I get come from the women, the wives of these men who say thank you. Thank you for returning my man. Thank you for returning my man. Thank you for letting my king come home and none of this would have been possible without ClickFunnels. It is the marketing arm. It is a software tool that supports our ability to reach into the globe and to find our targets and to bring them home.
