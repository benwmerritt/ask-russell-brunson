## Transcript
Are you guys excited or what? I'm really excited too. I guess this is happening. Yeah. I've been talking about this for a long, long time and now it's here. I love your shirt by the way. It looks great. Yeah, yours too. Yeah. We wanted to do this big presentation on today which as you guys know is ClickFunnels 7 year birthday which is crazy. Seven years ago we had more than nine months of labor prior to that though. Oh yeah. This is the day it was actually born. So this is the day we finally had a chance to show. And anyone who's ever created anything, if you've written a book, you've created a product, anything, there's always that initial part where you're in private creating something and it's fun, it's exciting and then the first time you make it public it's scary, right? It's like I'm showing what I created to the world, what they hate it, what they judge it, what they don't like it. And I think we felt that way initially seven years ago when we were like, this is what we're working on you guys, what if everyone hates it, what if they don't. And today right backstage Todd said that like, here's my baby, everyone take a look and judge it. So we're a little nervous but we're really excited because it's a good looking baby. So we're excited to show you guys ClickFunnels 2.0. It's kind of recapped to bring us back to where we were yesterday. So as you guys know, after we got an offer for some of my ClickFunnels, we flew out and Todd and I decided that we did not want to sell. And after we told them no, we hung up the phone, that's when this began. That's when the craziness of like, all right, well, if we're not going to do this, like, let's get back to work and create something amazing. And these are some of the pictures of that actual experience. I'm glad we captured these because I think in this moment we were excited and scared and like second guessing ourselves and all the things wrapped into one. What you see from our faces, I think the energy inside of like, this is the future. This is the next 10 years of our life and we're so excited to start running with you guys. And so that happened first. Then Dave, as you guys know, could not be at a party without us. So he jumped in a plane and flew out. We decided to make ClickFunnels great again. And then we spent an entire week at Todd's Lake House building and creating and figuring things out, drawing things on the board, doing tons of calls and planning out what we're going to share with you guys today. So I had something interesting about the time we started this conversation. My brother, who is not like a funnel hacker crazy, but he came to me and he's like, I've got a band. I want a website. You've got ClickFunnels. Can I build a website? ClickFunnels. And I was like, yeah, you should just build a funnel instead of like, but okay, I'll build a funnel, but he didn't know what that was, right? So I gave him a ClickFunnels account. He started trying to create things. And I thought he just kind of given up. He comes back like a month and a half later. He's like, I built my website and he had like 40 different pages and menus on every single page, linking from the end, this whole thing, right? And he got it all done. I was like, oh my gosh, like you spent a lot of time on this. He's like, you had to figure out the menus and how they work and everything. But as a lot of you guys know, he was creating, you know, the navigation menu and doing it over and over and the footer over and over and all these things. And he got it to work, but it took him a long time. And I was like, oh, ClickFunnels is supposed to be fast. And then he was like, I want to sell my t-shirts on here, kind of a shopping cart. And I was like, well, kind of like, you need a funnel, but you know, and kind of back and forth. So my brother went and created a Shopify account and they linked from ClickFunnels to a Shopify account. And then all these things I'm just like, oh, like so frustrating. Like, I know what my brother, what he wants, right? He wants what people understand. He wants a website. He wants a store. But he needs a funnel, but he wants these other things. And I was like, how do we, how do we create something where it does both things where it gives people exactly what they want, which is typically a website, a shopping cart, things like that, but also gives them what they need, which is funnels. As you guys know. And so these are some of the conversations we're having. Like how do we create something that combines these things? Because we're the best in the world at funnels by far. How do we become the best in the world at all the things that we need as entrepreneurs so we can free all of our entrepreneurs? So you guys can get back to serving your customers. And that's kind of where this whole conversation started beginning at. Yep, absolutely. We're going to begin with the funnel hub. Mike and Agie did an amazing presentation today talking about a funnel hub. And we wanted them to come on ahead of time because this is the kind of the structure, the core thing that ClickFunnels 2.0 leads with. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it boils back to a little bit like what you were saying about your brother. We have a lot of people that come into the world and they, they're just, they don't understand what a funnel is when they're getting into the ecosystem. And they want to create their homepage. They want to create the beginning of their site. And funnel hubs are that strategy that we can teach them. And this really helps people get started super easily, but also run their entire web presence on ClickFunnels without this piece. None of the other pieces are possible, right? This is the base foundation. This is your domain, your website, your customer centers. You guys will get a peek out here in just a minute. And of course your blog. So that's just basically the foundation that lays up everything else for you. When you jump in and start customizing your, your funnel hub, your site, you'll see here on the left hand side, you actually have theme pages for all the different major areas. And what we're going through basically, and you have like your homepage of your site, your homepage of the funnel hub, you have your store pages. Are here, right? So part of your theme translates into your store. So once you design your theme and your styles and everything for your homepage, it translates into your e-commerce store. Translates into your blog. You're able to override and customize it as you want. But it's, it's all done in one place. So you're able to just use the ClickFunnels editor, use the power of the ClickFunnels editor to actually customize everything about your business and about your website. It's cool because like, how many of you guys have done a funnel yet at the first page? And it's redesigned it again and redesigned it again where this is like you set all the style sheets up ahead of time and then boom, that style goes throughout the entire site, the shore, the shopping cart and everything, which is so cool. One of the things that makes that possible is what Russell touched on earlier, which is what we're calling universal sections. And you'll see this new purple element when you're in the editor. We made it purple tonight to stand out nicely, right? Look at this to be a little bit obvious. But the universal sections, you can basically take any section that you have in your entire site, in your entire, any of your funnels, anywhere. Turn them into a universal section and from then on, whenever you use them on any page throughout the app, updating it on one page will update it across all the other pages that are using them. Which is great for headers, for footers and all that kind of stuff, which is amazing. Absolutely. All right, the next thing here inside of Funnel Hubs gives you your blog, right? So there was a good bit of excitement on the blog thing too. So blogs are awesome for being able to build content, get organic traffic to your website. And quite frankly, most of the editing experiences and tools out there aren't that great when it comes to actually customizing your blog and building things. So Mike and Adrian backstage are like, we use this one. It's the best of all the worst WordPress editors. Like they're all bad. And so he's like, the fact this is going to be ClickFunnels is insane. Yeah, absolutely. And then security, you have the security of our infrastructure and everything behind you too. You're not constantly updating plugins and trying to keep your site online all the time. And our blog experience is SEO optimized from day one and also benefits from all the speed and performance of the new editor. Very, very cool. By next year, all our fun hackers will be bloggers too, which is awesome. Cool. Pages are maybe self-explanatory, but we've never in ClickFunnels actually group things separately from Funnels, right? So you build a funnel and then you can add as many pages as you want. This allows you to build page templates that can be used in a variety of environments. So if you build an order page over here, you actually can convert it into an opt-in page or vice versa and turn things into different things. Right? I know many of you power users hit that bottleneck all the time. So this allows it to be way more flexible. So you can come in, you can create a 404 page, you can just create one off page is super easily and have them nicely organized and easy to manage. So the next thing is one of my favorite things because this is something that's been a pain in my side since day number one of ClickFunnels. Like, I wish we could do this. And as we're thinking through this, again, then this is one of the big reasons. Why this was not like take ClickFunnels 1.0 and tweak something or add a feature. Like Todd had to rethink the structure of how everything works so that this next feature is possible. And the next feature is customer centers. Yeah, the customer center. So this is the center of your business. This is everything, right? So this is whether you're selling courses, whether you're doing lead magnets, no matter what you're doing, everything from your customer's invoice history to their lead magnets, to their courses, to their billing profiles, to their cards. Everything is managed in here. So if you're shipping physical products, they'll see their order tracking information here. If you're shipping, if you're doing courses and digital stuff, they'll find that access here. They'll find everything all in one spot, easy to manage and easy to update. One thing that's so cool for me about this is how many guys have set like 300 funnels up and each funnel you have to go add the products, get over and over and over again. Like now because this, you can create products globally and someone buys it. Boom, it shows them your customer center. If they log in the customer center and they bought three of your products, not the other two, they're there. They can click a button and one click up, sell boom, unlocks it. And they can start getting access to all your other products and services all inside the customer center, which is so cool. Yes. Anything else on customer center? Do you want to touch on? That's probably it for right now, but there are so many things that we don't have in these slides right now, just like you mentioned, right? So you have a sales channel visibility across your different global products on the platform. So you're able to check a box and list a product in your store, check a box and list a product in your customer center for sale. So anyone that hasn't purchased it, we'll see it as an upsell available immediately. So cool. Okay. This next one is a big deal for a couple of reasons. One of them I want to message is you guys saw last night, did the virtual real estate presentation. I talked about, we have Zuma Juice and we have all Bomb Roth. We have all these different companies and things we're building out. Now the password to build those all one click funnels account. And let's say someday I was like, man, Zuma Juice is making a lot of money. I want to sell this business. If I try to sell it to someone, I'm like, okay, let me export these funnels and like these content. It was a huge nightmare. We're now, as you see here, we can set up teams, we can set up companies and set up different funnel hubs inside of it. So I can create everything inside of one funnel up. If someone buys Zuma Juice, I click a button and it goes from my click phone account to yours. And now you got the business. Everything is there, done and it's over that fast. It does way more than that. You want to go deeper into all the other stuff. That was like kind of like when I saw this, I was like, oh my gosh, like every one of my little companies can be a different thing. And that way I can do whatever I want with it. Which is absolutely. And this also lends itself great to you agencies out there. The agency plans that exist now will allow you to actually purchase a team and put people in your agency on different, different workspaces, different sites that they're working on and easily transfer it to clients anytime you want. And the other thing that we're working on is making this actually where you could share these. So we've talked about this briefly, but I might as well share with everyone too. So you'll be able to, in addition to like, and click funnels one point, you can do share funnels, right? That's the thing that you're sharing with people in this. We're going to do shared workspaces so you can actually build the entire business for someone and actually transfer everything. The follow up funnels, the funnels, the store, the homepage, everything all it wants to someone. I didn't know that. That's amazing. All right. The next one is one I'm so excited for. How many of you guys want to start finally having a shopping cart built inside a click phone as well? Yeah, we absolutely, we have thousands of you guys that use us as your front end. You drive traffic to us. This is where all your conversions happen. But you also have a Shopify store potentially and reconciling fulfillment and products and inventory and all these things. I know can become a nightmare. So our goal with this is to become the merchant of record for everything for you guys. Our products inside of click funnels will actually be able to be everything for you. So if you're running an e-commerce store, you're able to manage your designs of your e-commerce store inside of click funnels. The products, the inventory, everything that you're doing inside of a tool like big commerce or Shopify at this moment. Now will be possible inside of click funnels with the click funnels editor experience as well. Which is so cool. Yeah. I love it too. Because think about this, like most of us sell our products in different places, right? So you have it in global products and it's like, okay, I want this in my shopping cart. So boom, it's there when something comes in my shopping cart page is there. But also it's on upsell number three on this funnel, upsell 22 on this funnel. It's over here. And all of it sinks back into one spot, one fulfillment. Everything can happen there no matter if it sells it on upsell 23 or in the cart. It all kind of leads back to the same spot. And you have to recreate the product over and over and over again in all the data is in one spot. All the reporting is in one spot. Everything's there, which is awesome. One of the coolest things about that as well is that we've built in all our best practices. So things like bumps and upsells and everything that take like 13 different apps to do on the competitors are all just built in. You can just do it. Yeah. Some of the day shows that I guess shop flies like 29, 30 bucks a month for account. They show me to be able to do the same thing you'll do in click funnels out of the gate. There was like, I think it was like 12 or $1400 a month in app recurring fees to build to do what click funnels does out of the box day number one. So pretty cool. Oh, I ruined the surprise on the next one. So global products. Be excited again. Yes. Global products. So global products are kind of self-explanatory in one sense, but it's basically the ability to sell the exact same product in multiple funnels throughout your account, whether it's your store, whether it's funnels, whether it's upsells, front end products, you can set different price points. We support full variant control. You basically can put photographs, everything that you would expect to be able to do for proper product management is now built in by default for click funnels. Very cool. So cool. So cool. So we have fully optimized mobile experience for this. And I kind of mentioned that the defaults are built in, right? So you can see on there we have order bumps for the cart built in. So you're able to create pre and post checkout upsells. On the next slide, we'll jump in and I'll show you guys a little bit more about how that works. So using the new funnel builder, which you guys got a quick preview of there, but the funnel builder allows you to build upsell flows as well as full blown funnels. So you're able to build an upsell flow that you can actually set up with conditions. So you're able to create multiple upsell flows based on the conditions of what the person checked out in your store. So you're able to say if they bought this book, then send them through this upsell funnel and the exact same thing on the front inside. If a certain product is in their account, we can show them different bumps. So we'll be able to optimize that full checkout experience and turn your store into a funnel. So cool. Yeah. Here's some more screen show that showing that like boom, here it is, order form bumps, one one click upsell, everything happening. So you're getting the power of like a like a store with also the power of the quick phones editor, the upsell, downsell process, everything else, which is so cool. Okay, so move on to the smart funnel builder. I don't want to glaze over the fact that in addition to all this new cool stuff, our primary focus was making what ClickFunnels is the best in the world at even better. And this starts with the funnel builder. So the new smart funnel builder is built in a way that allows us to do much more complex funnels with an easy to understand user interface. So in ClickFunnels one, you can obviously do basic split testing with this. We can do entire branch split testing as I call it. So you can literally say, send them down this path for order processing and upsells or this path and you can do exactly like entirely different funnel experiences. And in addition to that, you can do split testing that is based on conditions of the known buyer. So if they've already purchased your book, your dot com secrets book, let's sell them the traffic secrets book instead. And we can conditionally update the funnels in real time as people are going through them. The stats and everything that are actually on the funnel builder now are built in as well. I know one of one of Russell's pet peeves about it now is the stats can be a lot, right? Like we've got a lot of data, a lot of information that we're throwing at you. Inside of the new funnel builder, stats are actually built into the nodes. So you're able to see the stats in real time, set conditions, set filters, see in the context of the larger picture of your funnel, what exactly is going on based on different conditions and split tests that you're running in real time. Okay, after the funnel build, the next thing that is one of the ClickFunnels most important things we believe is the ClickFunnels page editor. And this new editor, when we started brainstorming, Todd's like, so what do you want to do? I'm like, the biggest thing I want to do is do what Google Docs does, where we can all be in there working together. Because how many of you guys have ever had this experience where you're editing a funnel and you're like, I'm not a designer, so my designers are editing and I get done and I'm like, okay, I'm out of the page, you can go in and then he goes in and then he starts designing stuff and then I'm like, oh, crap, I forgot to save the page. I'm like, oh, and I saved the page and overwrites his thing. So he saves my page, I'm like, no. And then, and like, and for me now, we've got four or five people that are in the funnel. So we're in a Slack group and I'm like, okay, I'm out of the funnel, you can go in. Anyone's page right now and make sure that no one else is in it. And it's like this biggest nightmare of communication. Sometimes it'd be like 11 at night and I mess it up. Is anyone in the page and no one's responding? And I'm like, fingers crossed. I'm like jumping in like, I hope I don't mess up somebody else's work. I'll go in just hoping. We're now, as you guys know, there's the Colab feature, which is amazing. I think that's the next slide. We'll go into this. Yeah, absolutely. Which is not easy to do, by the way. I don't want to talk about that part of it. No, I mean, obviously that's not a trivial thing to overcome. And that's one of the reasons why the editor experience has been written from the ground up from an editing side as well as a page side. So this allows us to actually in real time stream those updates to everyone that's connected. So whether it's two different people editing a page or two dozen people editing the same page, it'll stream all the updates fast and easy and make it very clear for everyone that's working on it. Yeah, it's cool. And you probably see the pictures like, let's say I'm editing the headline, you can see like, oh, Russell's editing the headline right now and so on. So it's over here. And you see exactly where people are at, what element they're touching at any given time. It's like, okay, I'm not going to touch that because they're here, but I'm going to go over here and we can all work together, which is anyway. Of all the things, one of the things I'm probably most excited for. For sure. And this is the next part about the editor, which is really cool. Oh, our new speed test. You want to click through these or? Yeah, absolutely. So this is definitely something that for a long time we've wanted to optimize. So when ClickFunnels first came out for a little context, there was nobody on the market that did anything close to it. And we kept adding new features and exciting stuff for you guys. And over time, that was a lot of stuff that's on your pages. So when we were starting from the ground up on this one, I put out there for my team that it was non-negotiable that we had to be faster than every other editing experience on the market. And that's not just in building your pages, but also when you're rendering the pages and optimize conversions. So if we jump right into it, we're going to go straight head to head with some competitors. And I hope it's all right. We're throwing some logos and some names out there. But we went to their sites, went to their template pages, the pages they were bragging about, and we went ahead and decided to see how we. Real quick, this is one of those things where as a competitor, we guys see the ads that's like, ClickFunnels versus us and shows us as a snail and somehow faster. And I'm just like, I want to fly to their houses and delete their ads account. So I was like, Todd, I want to fight all these people face to face in the competition. Let's go. And so that's kind of where this slide came from. So we took their pages and just built them in our own editors. Right. So just start out to give you some context on ClickFunnels 1.0. ClickFunnels 1.01 about half of them. And we lost about half of them as well. Right. Yeah. Pretty close on most of them. But check out ClickFunnels 2.0. We beat everybody. And not by a small margin on most of them. So because of the way we're optimizing things, because of the content delivery networks that we're partnered with in order to do this, we do everything from rendering your pages on 40 different edge servers around the world to also optimizing your images in real time. And what I mean by that is we'll take your images when you upload them. We will resize them for the resolution of the browser that someone's using. We'll compress them. We'll do all the optimizations that you normally have to do in external tools and bring them in in real time. If someone's on a mobile device, we'll actually change the file in real time for them. And it'll be ready to serve when they load it up. So, so cool. So one of the next things that I want to jump into, which we do a great job of, I think, in ClickFunnels 1.0, but it can be confusing to build complex ones, is follow-up funnels. So inside of 2.0, you have a similar experience to our funnel builder inside of our follow-up funnel workflow builder, as we call it. So inside of here, you're able to basically build anything that you can build in ClickFunnels 1.0, but with far more advanced logic and split testing rules. So you can do full split testing branches on entire sequences of emails, on entire sequences of follow-ups. Does that SMS that you're sending out actually matter? I don't know. Put it in a split test and you can find out in real time. So this allows you to do all kinds of amazing stuff. The conditions on this that apply in ClickFunnels 1.0, we also have in here. So you're able to say, if someone's bought a certain product, send them down this route. We also have more advanced features such as goals that we'll touch on over the next few weeks and months ahead to train you guys on. But it's very, very powerful. And funnel stats. So I briefly touched on this a minute ago, but funnel stats are now on every single node inside your funnel builder. So you're able to click a button, toggle them on, see exactly the conversions on all your pages based on different conditions. And this is, I think, powerful for you when you're going in and saying, which split test worked best? Like, well, just glance at this. You don't have to look at a table. You don't have to translate anything. You're going to see it at first notice, basically. Beyond that, sending emails. So obviously, with the follow up funnel, we also wanted to optimize email sending as much as possible. So similar to ClickFunnels 1.0, you can broadcast emails. You can do email sequences. You can do everything you could before. But we've optimized that experience on both the editor side and the builder side. So within one quick, easy to use UI, you can build an email, preview an email, send an email, do some of the powerful best practices that we teach you guys, such as sending out multiple subject lines and seeing which ones work best and then sending the rest of them with that all built in. This one was one of the most exciting things that you were excited about. How many guys want better membership sites? So the first thing that I had a chance to build inside of ClickFunnels 2.0 is a membership site. And so this is the first membership site ever built on ClickFunnels 2.0. We'll talk about this another day. But it works. It's amazing. It's exciting. Anyway, I'll pass it back to you. Yeah, no, absolutely. So tying into those customer centers. Once you have someone logging into your customer center, or if they buy a course from you in the first place, they're creating an account in the customer center. And here they're able to get into the course and actually access it securely in real time. Right? So some of the power features that we have in here is we're going to be hosting your videos. We're going to be optimizing your videos for you in real time as well. We're going to be caching them and securing them so we can secure your videos. We're only the IP address of the user that's logged in can ever use that video file. Yeah. Inside of the editor experience, we bring the entire power of the ClickFunnels landing page editor to be able to build your lesson pages, your course pages, everything throughout the entire thing. You're going to see throughout the app. You're going to see new elements. You're going to see what we call collections. So you're going to be able to create collections inside of it. And you can say, put a collection of my lessons on this page. You're going to be able to do that throughout the entire app. And we're going to show you guys powerful ways to use that. But overall, this experience is by far the best in the industry. There's nothing that comes close to being this flexible and this powerful. And it still is familiar with everything you've been building Funnels on forever. So cool. This is just a quick preview of one of the first ones that was built in it by my design team. And this is showing off the customer center and some of the lesson pages. And these are pages, those elements right there with the course videos. That's a collection inside the editor. You can style it however you want. You can design it however you want. There's zero limitations. And of course, we plan to work with the designers over the next few months and build you guys amazing templates that'll be in there by default. You can customize to your heart's content. And that's without any programming knowledge, of course. And Russell touched on analytics. So we were showing you the funnel stats. So you can get into the funnel stats. You can see a high level view, but we are not leaving out you guys that are doing the data on a daily basis with driving traffic and want to know exactly everything that's going on. So we've stepped up our analytics to the next level. We have the ability to build custom reporting inside the app. So you can come in and you can tell us exactly what data you want to see and how you want to see it in real time. And it'll customize the page for you, for your funnel, for your business. And next up, CRM funnels. So you want to touch on this one? How many of you guys could benefit from having CRM inside your ClickFunnels account? All the high ticket sales people are like, yes. So there's a lot of use cases for this, but I need the biggest feedback from people who are doing high ticket sales and things like that. How do I take a client and lead and move them through a process? And that's what the CRM funnels, first set down, brings for me. How do I make this work? How do I take some step-to-step and page-to-page? And so you can kind of see some screenshots of what it's looking like right now. And CRM funnels are going to be amazing as well. Yeah, they're actually, they're super exciting. As you, we've got a quick little preview there of the contact management side of things. And we've really focused on making contact management top notch throughout the entire application. We want it to be easy for your team to get in there, manage your contacts, handle payment processing things, and handle access to courses and enrollments, everything that you would expect. And then above, we've got deals and pipelines that you're going to be able to use to actually use opportunities and move things people through, trigger your follow-up funnels and workflows based on different levels that they are inside your pipeline. So. Oh, so cool. Should we answer a couple of questions? This is the question by far we've gotten the most, I think, bar none. By far, yeah. There's one point on there's 2.0. How does this part work? How many of you guys are curious about that? Okay, I'm going to talk about it. All right. So as I've said since the beginning is basically I wanted 2.0 to be a separate platform so we could accomplish all these things we wanted for you guys in a reasonable timeline. So 1.0, first off, don't worry. It will literally stay around forever. We have no plans to depreciate or get rid of 1.0. But what we will do is once you actually move over and sign up for 2.0, you'll be able to put your 1.0 account on a maintenance plan. Meaning all your funnels there will work forever. You can keep collecting leads. You never have to rebuild anything if you don't want to. It'll be there. But you can build all your new stuff on 2.0. Yep. Simple as that. Slowly start migrating stuff over and things like that. Yep. Very cool. And the big question maybe. So the next big question then is, when does ClickFox do what? I'll go live. I voxed Todd every single day now for six months asking him this question. Todd, that's good. That's the big question. When does ClickFox do what? I'll go live. Obviously, my goal is to give it to you guys as soon as humanly possible. And I want to give it to you guys today. But this is the realistic rollout plan. What these guys have accomplished in a short period of time is literally insane. The team they've assembled and how much that they've done. To put this in perspective, if you look at a company like Shopify, Shopify has 1,000 developers. 2,000 full-time developers that spend a decade and a half on their platform. Todd and his team, that's lean, they're faster. They've moved insane amounts to get this to where it's at. It's insane. It's really, really cool. And we are getting close to all the final testing and things like that. So we're going to have this to have this ability to start giving it to you guys. And one of the benefits of you guys being part of Funnel Hacking Live is you're going to get it before anybody else in the market. Yeah. So this is how it's going to work. ClickFunnels 2.0 will be live for the entire market in March. The beta group is going to be starting for the beta group in January. But who here wants access to ClickFunnels 2.0 the exact same time that I get access to ClickFunnels 2.0? Yeah? Okay. So that is the game plan. We've got a really cool rollout strategy I'll talk about here in a second. But feature by feature, Todd and his team have given it to me. I have a chance to test it and we're going to give it to you guys. And we came doing that piece by piece over the next couple of months and gives us all the ability to kind of learn it together, grow together, get any bugs and feedback together. So that way in January, we open the beta. We'll be ready to rock and roll, which is going to be so cool. So what do you do when you guys become part of this today? A couple of things. One, you're going to get a really cool shirt that Todd and I have, but you're going to become a founding member of ClickFunnels 2.0. And do I talk about some of the benefits like being a founding member of ClickFunnels 2.0? Yeah, absolutely. So we're going to be giving you guys first access to any new feature re-release. And this doesn't just mean over this beta period, but in the future as well. So anything that we come up with that Russell's using and testing early on, you guys will also be the first to get access to that and to be able to give us feedback and hopefully work with you to make sure it's the best thing it can be. That's awesome. Yeah. There you go. All right guys, thank you so much. We love you. We'll see you guys tonight at the work show.
