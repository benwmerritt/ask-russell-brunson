## Transcript
A local boysy man was cut shooting fireworks into a fish pond. Oh! There was a... Saturday saved! Music I literally have today and Monday to build 270 funnels. Music Every single bit. You know, we've all had some impossible things before. This is probably the biggest. How many videos have you made today? There's gonna be 18 total. I've completed five of them. How many followers do you have left right now? I'm in my pace room. He's showing me because he hated my idea. This is a great idea. We're all being immortalized right now! Yeah! Music Just keep swimming! Keep swimming! You're doing great, son! That's my dad! Music So it's Saturday and like Russell put out in a video, entrepreneurs are terrible at taking vacations. We didn't know what to do with ourselves. Remember brother Jared? How's it going? Anyway, this is probably gonna be a great idea. Any idea that starts with a phrase, this is gonna be a good idea, is actually a really bad idea. Music Music Music Music Music So we have ourselves a little pond in the back. Just because we're camping we're shooting Roman candles into it. It's probably a good use of time. You ready? I'm ready when you are. Ready? Go baby! There we go! This is a great idea! Whoa! It was still on fire shooting into it! Look at that! Holy crap! I'm glad there's no fish that live in this thing. There's no more. I don't know how many there are. I'm really afraid to know if these are done or not. Saturday saved! Music Confessional time. Saturday, my wife is gone the whole day so I was watching the kids start from the morning and take my vitamins. Be all good and I open the closet and they're not one but two boxes of Lucky Charms. And then some really slippery slips. Started with Lucky Charms and then we had another bowl of Lucky Charms and then we went out to eat and then we ordered pizza and then we had ice cream and then we had ice cream and then we had a bowl of Lucky Charms. So today is like the punishment day for that. I assume we'll work out one day this week so this is payback for the last two days of carbs. It's so good. Music We did it! How do you feel? Oh yes! We had to kill ourselves because that's the only workout we're getting in this week for sure. One for the month! One for the month! Woo! Here's the deal. We have the cookbook and the viral video launch in one week and I am doing a fat event. So it's three days gone. The viral video launch is on Friday so I literally have today to do the task. Russell just gave me which is to build 270 funnels. It's literally 333 pages. He's given me insane tasks before but this one's pretty intense. The record so far is he gave me 11 minutes once to prep and build. So I'm going to do that. That was crazy but like 270? That's how many I've built in the last year and a half. I've been here total. There's just no way man. That's so intense. What's your play for today? Well we thought we'd build a couple funnels. Like 270 of them today. We have to. We've all had some impossible things before. I don't know that all at the same time though. This many of them. We're launching a book. We're launching a book. 270 funnels training. Plus the event. Plus I found my pictures Thursday. I broke my toe. Which toe is busted? That one at seal verbally and nasty it is. Can't even curl that bad boy. Can you normally curl that toe? I mean you know I have a few weights. So I have a question. How many funnel years have you been on that right now? I'm really curious. I'm kind of stressed right now. I only have about one funnel year. Four funnel years? Oh I have one funnel year. We're planning everything that we've done before you live. Todd's flight got canceled. I can't think of anything I was wondering. Crazy storms ruining all the fun. Alright we're heading into the company meeting. Giving her on the page and then we gotta start running this fast we can go. You have to be Batman for the rest of your life. I got a stupid Batman outfit. I was an old prospector many years ago for Halloween. Really? He was there. That's scary. He's been terrified. We'll start first talking about the viral video party update. So we have miles 353. 353 people confirmed. Woo! We got a little Irma fallout so not everyone's going to make it. But we will have 350 here on Friday. So we're pretty excited about that. We've got R.B. in the house speaking. We've got Harmon Brothers speaking. We've got Gary Vaynerchuk speaking. We've got influencers from all around the world coming in. Supermodels. Supermodels. I didn't notice. Working on the demo pages for the new ClickFunnels funnel. The problem is like this part here. It looks cool but it took the normal person's screen ends right here. So the video is way below the fold. I'm going to keep it up. So now I've got the new version which shrunk those up and pulled everything up above the fold. Now it's time to eat. Chef Gordon brought some good food. Steve doesn't get to eat yet. Keep on working on the fad event. It'll be good. You know what I mean? We're going to eat. Steve's got to work. We're going to eat. Check this out. We should cook first every day. I eat the same thing every day. So I would love it. Some signs for ClickFunnels. Hey wait, your account's being set up. We've got a free gift for you. This is why you need this. It's free. Boom. 10 bucks plus shipping handling. Or if you want Doc on Sears X Procursor Book and the Cookbook then it's whatever. Now just throw in the chef's cap and an apron and we're good to go. That's cool. Every single person will get at least this. Hopefully a lot of this. The books are part of the actual onboarding now. That's amazing. Everyone understands the strategy. There's the strategy. Okay, Page is going good. Working on the new order form checkout process. I take a break though because I got to get my shirt on. Because we're about to make some videos. What videos are we making today? I know for sure Harman Brothers. Yes, Harman Brothers interview. We're going to be behind the scenes thing. And something with ClickFunnels. Yes, the upsell videos. ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels. ClickFunnels. Yes, the upsell videos. ClickFunnels. How many videos have you made today? I think there's going to be 18 total. I've completed 5 of them. We're going to make it in time? If I average 5 per day we're good. We'll be recording through our video and there's 50 videos in the back of that. Yes. Not his. He runs a professional business. People like me all the day long. He just yelled at me because he hated my idea. I actually don't yell but I think I disagreed with Harman Brothers. We had videos going this way against the wall there. I was like, I want to go there. I thought we built a glass wall so it could be Gary V style. Look at all this glare on the glass. It's like, it's cool. Okay, if you like that, alright. If you blur it though, if you make it blurry back there so you just see lights popping. You're saying it's too short a room to pop. Well, yeah, because I need... I'll do what I can. Here's a new setup. It's going to throw this way. But there'll be glare. I think we paid for that glare. Ooh, it looks cool. Okay, so I am Russell Brunson with ClickFunnels. Not really, but I like to pretend on cameras. Alright, so the best of my new hackathons and boys, the coolest of my house is that I am able to jump out and head home. For a few minutes, people play with the kids before I come back and work some more. So, head home. Alright, I'm in my pacing room. Others call it the event room. I just finished 333 pages. Today and yesterday. It was crazy and Russell was like, dude, that's nuts. I was your brain. I was like, I'm kind of dead. So I'm in my pace room. I'm just kind of pacing. That has got to be some kind of record, man. This is so freaking cool. The bulk of the scariness is over. 333 pages. It's going to turn into 270 sales funnels. Ridiculous. Alright, so it's 10.30. I am about to crash. I'll get back tomorrow for live event. But I want to show you guys that I'm working on because I'm really proud of it. So, check this out. First thing you come to the page, you got someone wants to watch a demo. They click on this. Pops up. They can opt in for the demo. They come here and basically they'll be a video for Edison Editor. Should be cool. And then, they come back here though. They click on, sorry for working the trial. Then they're taken to the pricing page. They choose monthly or annual. Prices up here and they click on the button. And then it drops down to a single page where they can buy some basic tools from here to there. So it's going from complex to less to less. It's a fine process. After that, then we have an OTO. These are upsell. Hey, my name is Russell Brunson. Oh, that's the video recorded like three hours ago. It's already live. They're working on funnel years. That's why. I'm proud of it. The lead turned out really good. So that's about it. I'm not open. It's a sleep so I'm going to be presenting here in like eight hours. We're playing LEGO. Who we are building? A LEGO funnel. Each LEGO represents a page. Pre-sell page, squeeze page. I need a VSL page. And then we just build a funnel like that. This is a way to teach fun strategy. You might remember a few episodes. Jacques, Jake over there mentioned that we were game-affined ClickFunnels. It's now a game. Woo, it's a game. Here we are. So this is what it's going to look like. This is part actually for this right here. So the things are going to go in here. Cool. So we just designed all these custom ones for us like this. In Vision Absorbs, designers design new eyes and stuff. And then you can like storyboards. I'm like, hey, what happens if I click here? Where's it taking me? Oh, go here and I click here. Yeah, just images. You can see what the flow is actually going to be like. So for the 22 funnel types, you got these little things here. That looks good. I got a cool hero funnel, homepage funnel, translation funnel. Love that hero one. We got tons of people there for the FAT event. This is my favorite thing to do at the beginning of every single event we have here ever. Just walk in and start screaming. Oh, you're all being immortalized right now. Yeah. That's right. We're not started yet. I'm just pumped.
