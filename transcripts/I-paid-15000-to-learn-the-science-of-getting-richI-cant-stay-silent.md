## Transcript
Today I want to share with you guys a book that I just got this week that I have been looking for everywhere and I'm so excited. It is the first edition copy of the book called The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace D. Waddles. When you open it up it's kind of funny because the price is $1 for this book. I spent $15,000 to acquire this book. Inflation has gone up a little bit since it was first written. He's like one of the authors that we know the least about. He wrote a handful of other books that are less known titles but this was the one that went viral back in the early 1900s. It was published in 1910. But what's interesting is that this book hundreds of years later came into the hands of a lady who wrote the book and eventually the movie The Secret. Whenever people talk about The Secret, where do these ideas come from? The law of attraction and manifestation, all these things. Most of these ideas were originally invented, discovered, put out there by Wallace D. Waddles in this book The Science of Getting Rich, which is really fascinating and interesting. It's weird because outside of that we don't know a lot about his life. He's one of those guys that's kind of a mystery. He was the one that brought these ideas first and foremost to the front lines that eventually later created a whole movement of people that created The Secret, which is the biggest personal moment movement probably of all time that happened. It all came back from this book right here, first edition copy of The Science of Getting Rich. I want to share with you some of the lessons that come from this book that I think are really important and really powerful. The first chapter is called The Right to Be Rich, like a God-given right for you to go and pursue and go after. I think it's kind of an interesting way to start the book is giving you permission to actually pursue this, especially back in the early 1910s where a lot of people, especially a lot of early Christians were nervous about wealth and money and that it was bad and they wanted to stay away from it versus like him trying to explain it. It's actually okay for you to go after this. When you have more wealth, you have more money, you can serve more people, you can change more people's lives. That's kind of what leads the book and then he starts transitioning to the science of getting rich. If you think about a science, there's like art and there's science. When you have something that's art, art is creative. There's not a process. You put things out there that are creative. The science is different. Science is very structural. It's like a step-by-step process. You do this first, then this, then this. You follow this process and the end of it, you get a result. It's replicatable. It's kind of like you're making a cake. You have a recipe. You're step one, step two, step three. He talks about here in Science Again Rich is the fact that getting rich is a step-by-step process. It's not something that some person is lucky here and some else doesn't. If you understand it's a very specific process, then you just got to follow the steps. If you follow the steps, the outcome will be you get rich. You make money at the end. I remember when I got into this online entrepreneurship world now 25 years ago and I was in college. I was trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I wanted to be a wrestling coach. I wanted something different. I had a couple of things I was thinking about that I should do with my life. But I wasn't exactly positive. And then that's when I learned about online business and how to make money. And it was interesting because when I jumped into that, I started studying. I was learning the process of how to actually make money, how to create a product, how to make an offer, how to put it out there. I was learning the step-by-step process. And eventually, after learning for a couple of years and practicing, then I started making a little bit of money, a little more. And then I started just doing the process over and over again and started getting really wealthy. Ten years ago, I moved into the home that my wife and I live in now with our kids. It was a new neighborhood. It's a bigger house. The neighbors were different. And so the first time we had a chance to kind of hang out with them, like a block party thing. We go over there and there's a lot of entrepreneurs. There's bloggers. There's doctors. There's lawyers. And so it's like, it's a different group of people than we've ever been around. And we're here. We're hanging out. And I remember dinner that night, one of my now friends, but he's a doctor. And he kept looking at me weird. I think partially because I look like I'm, you know, it looks like 11 years old. But he was looking at me weird. And I was like, is everything okay? He's like, I just don't get it. And I'm like, what do you mean? It's like, you're so young. I'm like, I don't get how you're so much smarter than me. I was like, what are you talking about? He's like, I know how much you paid for your house. I know basically, he's like, you're making me more money than me. He's like, it doesn't make any sense. And I stopped him. I was like, first off, I am not smarter than you. Again, people are dying. You cut them open and you fix them and then they live. Like that's magic. Like what you were doing. I was like, the difference is that you spent your whole life learning the science how to heal somebody, right? And so like, it's a great skill set and you get paid X amount. I was like, I spent the last 20 years of my life studying the science of getting rich. What do I need to do? How do I create wealth? How do I create opportunities? How do I drive traffic? How do I sell products? Like I focused on that science and because of that, I made way more money. Whatever you focus on, you'll become good at. If you focus on becoming a veterinarian, you'll become a great veterinarian. If you focus on being a great teacher, you can become a great teacher. But if you want to like learn how to make money, you have to focus on how to actually make money. The strongest things in science to get rich is really understanding that this is not magic. This is just a step by step process. If you study it and if you learn it, that's how you can be successful. There's like three groups of people. There's a group of people who come up to me and they'll see whatever and they don't say anything. They just kind of leave, right? That's always confusing me because I'm like, I'm always curious. Like when I see somebody who's doing something I like and I want to know what they're doing. And so the second group of people are people who do that. They kind of be like, what are you doing? And I'm like, oh, I have an online business. Like, wow, that's it. It just stops right there. And I think what differentiates me and really successful people from those who aren't is the third type of person, right? Third type person, someone who comes up and is like, what are you doing? And they tell you and like, how's it work? Like show me what to do. And then they start figuring out how to pursue and how to do the thing. If you want to get rich, right? You want to read a book like this, like the science, how do you actually do it? It's a replicable process. Like it's a science. If you find someone who's doing what you want to do, you just have to stop and ask them like, what do you do and how do you do it? And they can give you here's step by step. Here's first thing, the second thing and third thing. And if you model it can be successful just like they are. When I first started collecting books, my first goal was like, I want to run really nice book or something that has a story for each of the different genres I want to collect in, right? In my religious section of my museum someday, but like my collection I got, we got a first edition book and more. And the interesting thing I got because it would tell the story about why I care about these books, right? I got into personal development. I was like, I want to collect personal development books in each genre. I was trying to get like one really cool book or collection or something that I could share. So when people came to me, I could tell the story about that book. If they were interested in personal development, I could tell a story about that book. They're interested in business or advertising. I have a story to tell them because for me, it's all about creating experiences for people. And that's kind of the way it started. And then as my collection has grown, I feel like I've such a bond with these authors. Like I love hearing the stories and their life. Like the point here, I love his life. I have Elsie Lincoln Benedict's life. And Wall Street Waddles is the same thing. Like because he's more of a mystery, like we don't know as much about him. And so I've collected a whole bunch of things around him. But I was like, I want one book when someone comes and they're like, who's that guy? For me, it's like I wanted one unique book to be able to tell his story when people come into the eventual museum to see things. I want to share with you guys one quote, chapter six, it's called How Riches Come To You. You will not need to deal with people unfairly. You do not have to give them something for nothing, but you can give to every man more than you take from him. And so that's kind of the premise coming back is like when you're selling something, like you're giving more than you're taking and that person is receiving more than they're giving, right? Like both people win on both sides of the transaction. So you start understanding like the science of getting rich and getting wealthy and things like that. Like when you do it correctly, both people increase in value by making these transactions. Because so many times we think if we're going to go into business, we're taking people's money. It's like, no, if you go into business, you're providing value, they're providing value and both of you grow together. Only I was watching a video and I saw somebody who I respected who shared an idea and I was like, that is the most brilliant idea. And at first I was just like, man, I love the way this person's brain thinks. And it was really exciting for me. And then a little while later, I found out where the idea originated from and where the person actually got it from. First off, being a little disappointed, I was just like, man, that other person had the idea. They're the one that figured it out. They taught it to this person and then they just shared it as if it was their own. Like they just took it and didn't respect the person or the idea enough to give credit. People always ask me, like, Russell, why do you always give credit? Most people don't know who these people are that you're talking about, right? For me, it's like I have so much respect for ideas and for people who have these ideas. When I learned something from somebody, the way that I try to show my gratitude for the fact that they figured it out and discovered it, they did all the hard work, they compressed a decade of their life into a day and then gave me the nugget and I was able to take it and leverage that to grow my life, my business, whatever it might be. I have so much respect for the people and for the ideas that I always try to give credit to where I learned something. And I've been doing that now my entire career. In fact, if you read my books, I could have used them and like, here's what I invented on the internet. I was like, man, I learned this from this person, this from this person and like, I always try to give credit where credit is due. I think it's the reason why I have so much respect for authors of the past where I buy old books and all those kind of things is because I look at what they had to work through to earn these ideas. They're not mine to just give away. Instead, I like to give credit to the person I learned from and I think it makes the world a better place. Alright, if you guys want to get a copy of my book notes from Science and Getting Rich in the description, there's a link. You can click on it and go download my book notes. That way you can get the shortcut of this book. Hopefully you read the notes though and then you want to go all in and get a copy and actually read this because if you want to get rich, there is a science. It's a step-by-step process and Wall Street Wattles will teach you how and you can implement it inside of your business as well. So the link in the description, thank you guys so much and I hope you enjoyed this video.
