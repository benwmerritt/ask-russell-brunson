## Transcript
Hey, this is Russell Brunson. I want to officially welcome you to episode number one of the Russell Brunson show. And you may be thinking, Russell, this is not your first podcast episode. Why are you calling it episode number one? The reason is because I'm changing the name of the show. The Russell Brunson show. Talk about why here a few minutes and we got a bunch of really cool announcements. And then at the end of this podcast, I'm going to be going through six things. You got to focus on twenty, twenty five to grow and scale your company dramatically. And I'm excited. So that said, I'm going to jump right into the first ever episode of the Russell Brunson show. OK, so I'm going to step back. I want to tell you guys the history of this podcast for those who are just jumping in for the very first time. So when I first heard about podcasting, it was almost 20 years ago. In fact, I remember sitting in a hotel room and at a seminar and they were talking about podcasting and I was like, that is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. No one's ever going to podcast. It's not a real thing. No one's going to care. The word podcast is just so annoying that it's not going to become a thing. Little did I know they should become such a big thing. But I remember I fought up for a long time. But I do remember thinking like if I ever started a podcast, I was going to call it marketing your car. And so I bought the domain a marketing your car. And almost a decade later, I decided to launch my very first podcast ever when it started kind of catching on. And so I launched a podcast called marketing your car. And some of you may remember this. If you listen to the old episodes, it was on the back of my business kind of collapsing. Everything. You know, I had a time I built my company up to about 100 employees and everything had fallen apart. It was collapsing. Everything was collapsing. I let go like 90 somewhat people in the day. And I was moving down to this really small business and like, or sorry, to a smaller office. And I remember just being, I don't know, like depressed and sad. And like all my dreams have fallen apart. I thought I was failing and I had this weird, this weird pull, this real weird tug. Some of you guys have felt that before. I call it now the call to contribution. We feel it's like contribution. Okay. I got that term from Alex Sharfin. It's called the contribution where I felt like I should start podcasting. I'm like, this is the worst time to start podcasting. My company's failing. Everybody's falling apart. But it was like, you need to start documenting this journey. And so at that time where I had moved from this big, huge, like 20,000 square foot office down to like a 2000 square foot office, they got 100 employees down to like four or five that I could still afford. And I had a four minute drive from my house to the office every day. And so most days I'd grab my phone and I would just record a podcast episode. It was called marketing your car. And it was literally just like talking about what I was learning, but we were trying what we were testing. And it was, it was kind of how I launched it. And I remember putting it out there and, um, and, uh, I didn't know how to see if people were listening or not. So I put it out there, kind of promoted it. And then I talked to the best. And I didn't know for a couple of years before we, um, were figured out how to like actually hook up analytics to see how many people were downloading it. And I remember the time when we finally hooked it all up, I was like, wow, I'm grateful that I didn't know how few people are listening at the time. Cause I wouldn't have probably had put so much effort into it. I was doing it probably three times a week for, um, I don't know, for three or four years, four, I don't know, four or five years. I don't even know how long it is. And that just spun for me to go back and listen to those episodes in those episodes. I remember one episode I was talking about, like, you have to be more on to want to make more $10 million. You're like, why would you ever want that? It's so dumb to even go after that. You know, it's just kind of funny now. I remember, um, talking about this idea and talking about this thing called click funnels as we were developing and designing it. And it went from literally the, you know, our company failing to, um, to this journey of us launching click funnel thing and then going out into the world. And so the marketing, uh, in your car podcast, um, kind of was this really cool journey of me coming from a business failure up into launching click funnels. And, and it was just such a cool thing. Uh, and I remember, um, man, probably year two into click funnels, I hired this guy named Steve Lawson, some of you guys know Steve and he came into the office and he was my funnel builder, my first funnel builder I hired, he was sitting right next to me and all day long, we'd be talking and stuff. And he went through and he's like, I binge will listen to every episode you ever did. Very beginning. And he told me one, there's something one time he's like, he's like, man, the first like 35, 40 episodes, like you were not very good. He's like, by 40, 45, you started getting your, your groove and you started like actually being good. And, uh, I thought that was so cool. Again, so grateful. I didn't know that nobody was listening initially because I would've probably quit before I ever got that way. But it was also interesting. It took me 40 or 50 episodes to find my voice and start figuring out how I was going to speak to people and communicate. And I, I use that as a lesson. I talk about this actually in the traffic seekers book where, um, I talk about the fact that like you have to publish long enough to get noticed, right? And two things will happen. Number one is that in that process, you will learn how to find your voice. And then number two, um, your audience will have a chance to find you. I'm just so grateful that, uh, that I did it consistently long enough for my audience to start finding me. And actually looking at, uh, over the, over time, it was crazy because, uh, after we launched ClickFunnels, I launched my inner circle and what's crazy is like the majority of people who came into my inner circle came from initially, they were like, they were podcast listeners and listen to all my podcasts. Like, I felt like I was like listening to you when I was working out and driving and it became part of their lives. And so that was kind of how marketing in your car launched the very first version of this podcast. Then fast forward after that, I remember, um, I was buying a whole bunch of domain names and John Reese. I bought traffic secrets, product secrets, and all these different things. And, uh, and one of the things I bought from him was marketing secrets, which is his blog back. Like when I first got started, that was the blog back made it. He had, I used to read and study from him. He was the original OGs of this market and I bought marketing secrets and I decided to change the, the branding of the show to marketing secrets. And it became the marketing secrets show and it ran that way. It's another, I don't even know now, five, six, seven years. I think they're like 600 episodes. That's the marketing secrets podcast. I've always loved that. Um, and it's been, it's been awesome. In fact, this is the first episode that, that is a marketing secrets, which is hard for me. Um, but what's, what's tough is like, I don't know, I'm in a spot in my career and my life where I want to talk about a lot of stuff. And the marketing secrets kind of pigeonholes me this weird spot where I'm allowed to talk about marketing and I kind of go outside those bonds, but those bonds, a lot of people like, I've come to Russell to learn about marketing. I'm like, I know it's awesome. And so like for a little while, I was like, well, I love marketing, but I also love sales. What if I changed the, the branding to the selling online podcast? And I almost did that. We, in fact, we even created an intro video. It was awesome. But then I was like, I love talking about personal development. And so like we almost changed the podcast to round peg square holes. And that was going to be the thing where I was going to create a whole separate podcast and one on marketing, one on personal development. And, and it was just getting confusing. And I was like, you know what, this is the deal. People couldn't be for different reasons. Some of you guys came to me because you wanted to marketing. Some of you came to one of their sales. Some came to our personal development. Some of you guys just like, you have no idea why you're listening to me. You're just here cause I'm trying to entertain you or having a good time. Some of you guys like me telling stories about old people who have passed on and like who changed the world that, you know, like, uh, like Napoleon Hills and Orson Swett Martins and like all these people that like, and, and, and so I have a lot of things I want to talk about. And so I kept trying to ship these things around. Finally, I was like, you know what? Most of the people I know, the shows named after them. It's like the Rachel Hollis show, the Gary Vee show, like things like that. I was like, you know what? I'm just going to change this to the Russell Brunson show and I can talk about things I want to, um, all the things. And I think it'll be more fun for you guys. Uh, we're also on YouTube setting up a separate podcast channel where it's just my podcast stuff. So I have the Russell Brunson channel, which it's all sorts of stuff, but we're going to create a Russell Brunson podcast. It's just these interviews, just, just me going live. Like just these things that are very specific to, uh, to the podcast format that I'm going to kind of use. Uh, so by the way, that means you got to go back to YouTube and re-subscribe to the video versions of these. Um, but that's what we're doing again. But I also want to know that like, like when you're coming to an episode listening, I want you to be able to know like what you're getting into. Right? Um, I know there's some podcasts I listened to where like, I like to talk about personal, but maybe not this part of vice versa. So in the titles, I have like, it'll be, it'll be like episode one. Here's the title and then I'll have some kind of thing afterwards. It'll talk about it. This is the marketing episode, a selling episode, a success episode, or like a round peg square hole on talking about some other person from history that I think you should know about. And so that's kind of how I'll break these things up. There may be other categories come in the future, but for most part, um, you know, the things I deal with, the things I think I'm the greatest in the world. I'm great at marketing. I'm great at selling. Um, I'm obsessed with personal development and I love stories of just amazing people, um, who have passed on who most of you guys don't know about. So those things I'm, I'm passionate about and that's the stuff I'm going to be talking about more so during this podcast. So hopefully you'll find something that you love and, um, and it should be a lot of fun. So there's kind of set up about what the new Russell Brunson show is. So now you know, um, and I want to talk about, before I dive in, I've got, I've got six things I want you guys, that I want you to understand that I'm focusing on dramatically in our business this year. Um, I think are going to be the keys for us growing. Um, and so I'm going to talk about this here in a minute, but before we do, I want to talk about the last 12 months. Okay. Uh, we're at the beginning of the new year right now of 2020, what year? We're 25. I'm not bad at remembering year. I'm not going to remembering years. So, um, we're beginning of a new, um, a new year. And I'll be with that. There's a lot of new growth and things like that. And I've been thinking a lot over the last couple of weeks about this kind of stuff and, um, and also just about the last 12 months. And it's crazy. I just, before we got here, I listened to an episode that I did last December. So a little over a year ago. And, um, I was at a low spot in my business and my life. Um, and I could feel Santa, man, that, that Russell is in a lot of pain listening to that. And, um, and I was very excited. Like this year's going to be great. And we're going to do a lot of stuff and get kind of dig out of this hole and get back to spot, you know, where I feel like we're growing and having success. And, uh, it's crazy. The year later, like it's been a brutal year this year. I don't know about you guys, but, um, and for me, it's like the last, I don't know, the last cycle, I would say, I'm not into politics, but last political cycle has been rough for me, um, as a whole. And for me, for my business, for my family, just a lot of things, a lot of changes, a lot of stuff I was not prepared for. It was crazy. Um, I have a group, uh, I have my inner circle group and I have a group above that called the Atlas group. And, um, we met in December with the whole Atlas group and it was crazy. Almost every single one of people in that group were like, this year is really, really hard. Uh, everyone had very, it was a very consistent feeling of it being a really, really hard year. Um, and also like, I'm not in big, I don't know anything about numerology at all, but one of the guys, my inner circle names, Michelle, he, uh, he was talking about numerology is like, based on the numbers, like this year is supposed to be the hardest year for everybody, which one of the five based on numerology, it's amazing. So I'm like, I don't know about numerology, but I'm pumped because I feel something different this year. I don't know if you guys are feeling as well, but like, I'm really excited and really, really motivated. Um, the last 12 months have been tough and I want to kind of talk about that just cause, um, I think a lot, it's been tough for a lot of you guys. And, um, I want to have empathy for that because I'm going to talk about how to succeed this year and what to do, what to focus on, all that kind of stuff. But I also want to do it through the lens of like, I understand you're coming from. You got beat up this year. Man, so did I. You got to be in the last couple of years. Like so did I. And so if you, uh, and I'll fast forward actually four years ago first, so four years ago during the last election cycle, in fact, I remember it was like, it was the day of the election. I flew out to Atlanta and hang out with Todd. Um, and that's when we got the offer for somebody to buy a click funnel. Um, we'd gone through this process for five or six months ahead of time. And it came down and we, and, um, you know, it's just a big funnel, everything in the world's a funnel, right? But you know, we put it out there where people coming initially really high offers and then you go through all the due diligence and it goes from like 100 companies to 80 to 50 to 40 to 10 to, you know, all the way down to like three or four companies and we ended up getting three or four offers at the very end and it was the day of the elections that just happened. So it's the next day and we were sitting there looking at the offers and, um, I don't know, it was weird. The offer was insane. Um, had I have said yes to that, I'd never would have had to work again. Um, it, I don't know, it was crazy, but there was something weird inside where I was just like, I didn't feel good about it. I was just like, I don't feel like I'm done. I don't feel like, I don't know, it was a weird thing. Um, it's crazy because like the selfish thing would have been like peace. I'm out. You know, I've got a nine figure check for myself. Todd's got one all, you know, and it would have been, it would have been easy, but for some reason, I don't know, maybe we were done. We decided to say no to it. Um, and, uh, and, and it started this journey and we were so excited. Like we're going to build, we got, we got to build something because like we knew it would build cliff falls is amazing, but we knew we could build, we needed to build something for the next to take it to the future to do what we needed to do. We needed to do something different. And so we sat down and we went back through the drawing board and, um, it kind of designed it all out and Todd spent a year in by himself with a team, a team of guys build out the foundation for what would become the new click funnels. We spent a year of it and it was like turning out so good. And the next year's funnel hacking live. Um, and this is probably my mistake, but like I was so excited and I wanted people to know people were asking me. Like there's other competitors come out like, what are you guys doing? And like, and we were obviously fixing and trying to make the core product really, really solid and stable all kinds of stuff, but we were building something new. And so finally that next fun, like a life. So it was the year into development. I came out and I was like, okay, this is what I told him, like 2.0. So we're building this. What's it going to look like? And people were so excited. Um, and then, um, yeah. And so, and I don't know, some of the things where you always feel like you're, you're closer to done than you are, you know, and so that year we announced it and it's just crazy cause, cause half our audience was so excited. And then half and, um, half and half the audience was like, I don't know. It's just funny. Like the people who don't like me or like click funnels were just like from day one. Oh, it's going to be horrible. And it was just so, it was so crazy. I'm like, we just told you we're working on something and you're already talking trash about, like it just blows my mind how people work, but, um, then it was out there and so people knew about it. And so we spent the next year working on it and building it. And so the next year's funnel hack life was coming up and it was tough cause people were waiting a year for it. We were waiting and we'd been testing it for an entire year and it was very solid, like it was working great. They're like bugs and hiccups and stuff, but it was like, anyway, it is what it is. Right. And so the next year for like a live, we didn't launch it there. We did the beta launch everyone who was at funnel hacking live and then, um, and then like two months later, a month later, whenever we did the click funnels, 2.0 launch and we gave it to everybody. And what's crazy, this is like in hindsight, we launched click on this first time. There weren't very many customers. People come in, they find bugs, we fix them and then more people come in, we find more bugs and just like kind of cleaning things up. We went from zero to getting 18,000 new signups in a week, 18,000 people joined. And what's crazy, um, in hindsight, if I could go back in time and say, young Russell, don't be an idiot. Um, it, we had 18,000 new sign up and there were all sorts of things. And we spent the next year just trying to keep on top of it. And it's hard because like when we launched it, I told everyone, like, this is the beta 2.0. It's amazing. Uh, when you sign up for it for a year, we'll give you classic end two point to get both. So as they, my head is like, best of both worlds. There's going to be some bugs and stuff, but people can have classics. Doesn't matter. They both both best of both worlds. Problem is a lot of people don't look at that way. And we had people that were upset with us. For the next year we spent, um, just fixing things and fix it and try to keep in front of it and like improving it and getting the platform solid and like trying to, anyway, it was, it was a lot. And so that was like last December. It was like it had been a year of that. So again, four years, we had a year of building, a year of free launch and we launched it in a year. It's last December. I was like beat up and I listened to that podcast episode and I was just like, um, I was always beat up. Right. And I was just like, man, this is crazy. Like I'm trying to serve people. Like I, I literally did not quit. I did not take this huge payout and instead we just, we sacrificed all the stuff to like, to create this amazing thing for people. And a lot of the people who we'd created it for were angry at me and mad. And like talking trash about me and like attacking. And it was just like, I don't understand this. Like, we thought we were doing the right thing was to not just take easy money and just walk away. It was like, no, let's like, let's go back and like, anyway, it's just weird to me. And it was like, anyway, it was tough. It was tough. Um, and I remember at the end of it, I was talking about how a couple of things, like just how brutal it had been, like people attacking me and attacking the company and stuff that, and how hard that hurt me. Um, it also had been a year since, um, my partner, Dave Woodward had passed away, which was hard. And it was just like, man, I don't understand. Like when, I don't know, it's a weird thing. Like when you're the underdog coming up, everybody cheers for you. And when you're on top, it's weird how people just go on and take shots of you. Uh, especially people who like, who you helped, who you served, who you like, you help them start their businesses and launch it. And then they come attacking you. It's just like, I don't understand. I'm trying to do everything right. I'm trying to do what I think is best for us and for the community. Like I wasn't selfish and just cast out in like peace and like left, you left things where they were at. And so it was hard, man. It was, um, it was brutal. I think, um, it was something I was not expecting and then come into the new year. So a couple of other things. So I don't know if I talked about it on that podcast episode, but last December also my twins, uh, turned 18 and, uh, I don't know about you guys, but you, you always think you have more time with your kids and, and everything. And, um, and, and I'm like, I love my kids. They're amazing. Like, um, the beat of parents hard. I don't know if any of you guys are parents out there, but it is hard. Um, it's like crazy. Like you had a fun hockey live and I speak and everything I say, people were like latching on like that's so smart. You're the greatest, but your kids is not that way. Like you, it's like you try to give your kids everything and they, and, um, it's a whole different experience. It is, it is hard. And, um, try to give your kids the best and like parenting is weird because parenting, there's like, uh, I don't know how you guys feel as a parent, though, I always have this thing where it's just like, uh, and this isn't really true, but in my head, it's like, I'm like, there's no value as a parent, right? And that's not true. There's value, but it's like, it's like, you don't get anything out of your get paid for it. You don't get, you know, they don't tell you they love you when they get old. They're like, all these things are just like, and like everything you do is trying to help them and then they're angry. They're mad. They want to rebel and she's like, I'm not getting paid for this. I'm doing this because I love you. That's the only purpose. Right. And it's just so hard. And so, uh, last December, my twins turned 18 and it was tough because like, uh, one of my, one of my sons, we turned 18, you know, at birthday party for him when that he went out that night and then he didn't come back home and he basically moved out and, and that was not something we were prepared for or ready for. Um, when you know it was happening, it was in the transition for months was like, it was, it was brutal on me and on Collette and on knowing what was happening and why it wasn't coming home and where he was even staying and like, and like, I don't know, it was mentally, it was mentally really tough. Um, so being a parent's hard. So anyway, those of you who don't have teenagers yet, you're going to find out. It's a different game, but, um, that, that was really, I don't know. That was really hard. And then come January and I'm talking publicly about this, but, um, it's actually like a year ago this weekend. So, um, we had a, I don't want to get too deep into the details of it, but, um, we had a scare with, with our one son moved out, we had a scare. It was, it was a Friday night and, um, anyway, we were out till two or three in the morning trying to find him and all sorts of anyway, that's as far as I'll go. Um, they came home, went to bed and then the next morning I woke up at six a.m. for wrestling tournament, uh, took my son to it. And, uh, and for me, wrestling is my happy place. You guys know that like, um, nothing, nothing brings me more happiness than wrestling. And, um, anyway, I go to this, this wrestling tournament and watching Bowen's a senior year. We've been working so hard, like literally every day of the summer worked out, um, me, him and his wrestling partner, just trying to perfect things and get better. And he was like, just doing so good and so excited and right this wrestling tournament. And for some reason, normally the coaches sit back off the mat. For some reason, like the gym was small. Everything, everything's on top of each other. Like it's like, I'm sitting right on the mat and my son's wrestling and, um, and I did something stupid, uh, the kid wrestling put it, put a hold on my son that he should not have. The ref was very slow to react to it. And, um, I don't know, just call it lack of sleep, call it stress, call anxiety, call it being stupid, um, a million different things. And, um, I jumped out and tried to get the kid off my son. And, um, anyway, I got kicked out of the tournament, rightfully so. I should have. Uh, it was, I was in the wrong there. I should not have done it. Um, and, uh, and, and I thought that was it. I don't know. Normally that would have been what's it. Um, this kind of stuff happens in wrestling often. It's not something that, I don't know. It, and, uh, someone caught on video and, um, because I am lame, they posted it and tagged me and tagged everybody and, and that video went viral. Um, and I don't know if any of you guys have ever had a chance to, um, to stand in front of millions of people and have them all take shots at you without you having to really say anything back. Um, man, it is, it's brutal. It's crazy. Cause like we went to the family apologized, made it right. Like everything was fine. And then like the, the, the, um, I don't know, the, the jury of public opinion. I was called judge jury executioner of the world. Um, yeah, for next, I don't know, six weeks, I would say conservatively, I probably got, I don't know, three, 4,000 death threats. Um, I got people anyway, it was, um, it was like nothing I've experienced before. Um, they, uh, and again, some of the things that like, they happened in the normal world that went into that big of deal because it made on the news and it made it everywhere. I got on the Joe Rogan show. Yeah, I made on Rogan. Um, I don't know, but because of it, it was just, uh, they, they won't let it, they, they, uh, forced me to quit, quit as a coach. They wouldn't let me go and watch my son wrestle ever again. Let me go to practices. Uh, we'll let me even into watch a wrestling match for two years. I can't coach ever. Um, I literally taken the thing that, uh, most important to me away. Um, that was hard, man. I don't know. And again, it sucks cause like, I mean, it was a mistake. I did, I messed up a hundred percent. Man, I would say conservatively probably cost me a couple of million dollars, um, cost me a lot of anyway, it was tough. It was tough to see how like people who I thought were friends, uh, you know, jump up and throw you under the bus. People who are enemies feel like it's Christmas. They get a, do they want people using just for click bait, uh, just take as many shots as possible. Like it was, um, it was hard for me, for my family, for every, you know, anyway, it was, uh, man, uh, so that was, that was my January. Yeah. So I don't even know. Uh, but yeah, that was kind of, it was brutal. And then from there, um, it was, you know, the rest of the years kept happening. It kept having things and it just, we had, you know, problems with click phones, problems with employees, problems. It was just like, yeah, it's like everything could possibly go wrong. That year kept happening. It's, it could hit over and over and over again. Uh, towards the end of the year, we decided to take, um, look at our company. Our company's got a lot of stuff, right? We got click files. We got a training, we got everything coaching programs. I was one company and we decided to separate them as two of our companies. And so it's been a lot of time doing that. Um, which, uh, officially got done December 31st, January 1st, uh, we're running these two companies as prime mover, which is the info coaching side of business and click files, which is the software side of the business. But, um, there's a lot of, you know, a lot of things along the way. Anyway, it's, it's, uh, it was a tough year. And I'm sure a lot of you guys had had similar things. Um, in fact, it was like month after month. It's like, I don't know how, like, you know, just thing would happen. The next thing would happen. The next thing, it was just like, um, anyway, it just, just a lot. And, um, it's funny because like, I mean, you guys, if you follow me at all, you know, our mantra inside of click phones, you're one funnel way. You're one funnel way. And we launched a ton of funnels. It was like, I need funnels to increase coaching sales, to increase quick-formal trials, to increase revenue. So we don't have to let people go. And there were a couple of times we had to do layoffs this year. Like things like that. I was just trying and trying and trying. Um, and, uh, and it's crazy as we got close and closer than the year. Um, and again, one funnel way, man, I, I, I, I said that for the long time. It's been our mantra. Um, and if you look at how many different funnels we rolled out over the last year, but then, uh, towards the end of the year, uh, we launched after we were splitting the company info side, I was like, Hey, how do we, how do we sustain info product side, the coaching side, we need something. And so sat down and said, okay, we need to build something to sit down. We built a funnel. And you probably seen the funnel. It's, it's selling online.com and it's a three day event. And we launched that. And that event and that offer back in coaching everything just shifted everything for us. Like it, it gave me the ability to like, oh, oh, okay, it's working in, thank heavens. All right, we have an offer. We have someone to scale if someone can grow. It was like, it was like the brink of everything falling apart. And then like one funnel way, one funnel way. Wasn't that one? It wasn't that one. Wasn't that one? Wasn't that one? And I was like, boom, we got one. This is the one. Uh, it's the highest converting funnel we've had six, seven years. Um, and so that was the selling online funnel. And then it was okay. Now the info product side is happening, but like the click funnel side, we're still losing members. These are shrinking. I'm like, how do we, how do we save this? And it was like, try another funnel. You know, we did this funnel and this funnel. Same thing. Like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And all of a sudden during Thanksgiving, boom, we hit one called the last secret. You probably see the last secret. I come, we hit it. It was like, boom, like that was a funnel that we can grow. We can scale. And so by the end of the year, it was like, Oh my gosh, the two sides of the businesses, we had two, two funnels that are scalable, growing funnels that we can spend a million dollars a month on to grow the companies, both companies individually, it was just like, well, anyway, I think a lot of that comes back to like, I don't know, a year of a year of it being brutal is like a lot of praying and a lot of just up at bats, try this one, try this one, try this one. And a lot of times, you know, when, when things get hard, we just like clam up and just like, I'm not going to, I'm, I'm just going to, I'm going to quit. I'm going to, I'm going to, and it's like, we didn't have that opportunity. I couldn't just quit. Like I've got, you know, hundreds of employees that's like, I gotta try and keep trying, keep trying, keep showing up, keep stepping up to play and like striking out, striking out, striking out. And then how good it feels when you hit something and your team rallies behind it, it's just like, Oh my gosh, we have something that's going to like, it's going to serve our customer at such a level deeper than we ever thought possible. And then also something to like, our team is fired up about like everyone, like the employees, the staff, the team, like, and I remember selling a line of it. Like we got done and Miles runs our event came out. He was like, freak out. I was like, this is so exciting. Like first time I had to introduce the concept of try mover and like this, this, this thing. And he was just like, I'm a prime mover forever. He was so excited that everyone else was rallying behind us. Like, it feels like, like we're back, right? And the last secret to sending clip phones or trying different versions of things like, and like, how do we get trials back to where they used to be? How do we get all kinds of stuff? And then boom, that one hit and it's just like, Oh, thank heavens. So, uh, I don't know. There's something about that. You guys are just keeping, keeping on, keeping showing up and trying and trying and trying, uh, you know, despite all of the, all the challenges and all the pain. So that was the end of last year is like finally we had two funnels. And we're just like, now we get the two sides of our company, we can grow them. We can scale them. And we've got, we've got the ammunition we need. It was really exciting. Um, and that brings me to today. So, uh, actually tomorrow, so tomorrow, uh, I told you guys that twin boys, uh, one of my sons, the one left a year ago on his birthday and has been living away. And he's doing great now. He's got a job. He's having it anyway. So, you know, a year later, it's like, after you get past the initial three or four months of just like, I was not prepared for this. How does this work? How do you, how do you navigate the emotional and the physical and the, like all the things, right? He's doing great now and thriving and it's been, um, it's been interesting and fun watching him take that step into, uh, into the real world. And now my other son is going on a mission. Uh, in fact, tomorrow we're driving him to Utah to the missionary training center. We're going to drop him off and he'll be gone for two years. And so my family life is like changing. It's so weird. But also it's like, it's, um, it's, you know, we're more prepared now and it's, it's, it's better. So anyway, that's the, that's the year for me coming up to now. So I said the last four years, as you've seen, have been brutal at the same time. Um, now right now we are, we're on the, I don't know, the precipice of like so many great things. Um, like click funnels. Um, we're not calling it click, but it's 2.0. I have a new click. So we have like two, it's a really cool things happening this month before funnel hacking live. You guys will see, um, I want to tell you so about it. I can't, you'll see it soon, but just new things that are coming out there. Like so exciting. And like the platform is insane now. It's stable. It's great. The editor is second to none. The, the anyway, I'm so proud of what click phones has become. It took us longer to get there than we wanted. And I apologize for that. Um, but man, where does now is, is insane. I have, we have people in swarms coming back and like, they're like so fed up with all the crappy other solutions. And they're like, we missed the funnel builder. We missed this. Like click phones is today. The greatest funnel builder on the planet. Hands down. There's nothing that comes close to it. Um, the page load speeds faster. The features of simplicity, but like that. Oh, I get it is insane. There's nothing better than that. Like it is anyway. So that is true. And I'm proud of it. Um, and, and with that foundation, like growing again is like, it's so exciting. So, uh, okay. So with that said, sorry, there's a long lead up to the things I actually wanted to talk about and teach you on today's podcast, but I wanted to give you some, some, some background, why I'm called Russell Brunson show. Uh, why we're doing things like the last year. Um, and, and now it's like, Hey, we're beginning of the year. One of the things we're going to do to take over the world. Right. I would take over my world. Well, you guys take over your world and your businesses. And so I've got six things to be focusing on that are the keys. Uh, a lot of us come back to the fan, fan, fundamental foundational things that, you know, from the click, follow us, world from Russell Brunson from the dot com, see experts, check us, Travis Seeger's books, but it's refocusing. And it's funny because for me, it's like, this is what I'm refocusing on. And so for usually when I'm trying to refocus, like most of the people will follow me, like I'm also refocusing on the same things. And so I hope this helps serve you guys and stuff to focus on first. Okay. Thing number one, get your hand notes out, write them down. Thing number one is, uh, is focusing on, on creating a break even funnel for your business. Okay. What is a break even funnel? A break even funnel is a funnel that I can spend a million dollars a month in ads. And I get a million dollars back during the point of sale, during the signup process. Right. Um, it is the key. It's the thing that gives you the ability to sustain and grow your company. Okay. For me, selling online was the first one. Again, I was, I was, my whole goal is I need to get a funnel that we can spend a ton of money on to get leads in again. So we're trying to think after thing after thing, like this funnel, this funnel, this funnel, this funnel. And finally for us, it was selling online.com. That funnel became the break even funnel. Okay. It's a three day event. It's a hundred dollars a year ticket. Um, if you guys haven't seen yet, I highly recommend going funnel hacking it with the highest converting funnels of all time. Um, and it's working and you should also go through the event anyway, because the three day that I'll teach you how to actually sell more. So, uh, selling online.com. Right. It's a break even funnel. Okay. Right now I'm my goal. In fact, my entire goal, we were one of our guys in our inner circle. I'm an Atlas program. He spends $150,000 a day at ads. So I built this funnel with that goal. I need a funnel. I could spend $150,000 a day at ads. Uh, we're not there yet. Um, we are the spot where we're spending probably 50 to $60,000 a day in ads and trying to get that to the spot where we can consistently get to a hundred thousand hours a day at ads and beyond. Um, but if you can spend a hundred thousand dollars a day profiting on ads, what does it do for the rest of your business? Like it explodes. Think of a new leads, how much new blood is coming into your business every single day. Think about how much, um, I have you go buy your, your back in coaching program. And now you have these new leads, you can buy everything else in your ecosystem. Like the key number was breaking your funnel. So for the info product side of the business, which we call prime mover, um, that was the key. So I became the funnel and now we can spend the money a day. Now the second thing was like, I need to break even funnel in the click funnels business. We've had them for years, but over the last probably a year and a half, two years. We've not had a break even funnel. Okay. Uh, initially it was just, uh, it was a funnel hacks webinar. We ran that, you know, you guys know the story. I did a webinar, you know, like 70, 80 times live. Then we turned into this evergreen and ran that for years. Right. That was the funnel. Right. That funnel couldn't was not the, the offer of the webinar, whatever's not profitable anymore. So they turned that one off. Then one funnel way challenge was next thing we ran that for years. And that was the profitable front end funnel that we spent tons of money. We had a hundred and eighty something thousand people by the, uh, one funnel way funnel, right? That was the next one that lasted for a long time after that we launched to, but we had the year first funnel challenge. That one ran properly by two years, maybe a year, year and a half. We forced up working. It was like, we need a funnel, need a funnel. So again, we're trying different thing after thing after thing. And finally the last secret.com launched boom. And if you guys follow the Lynch pin model, it is modeling the Lynch pin, uh, business model to a T. Um, and so if you want to go see it, the last secret.com, you can go check it out. Um, but they registered for a live event. Then there's thank you page, Mifki giving people click for us trial. Um, and then we do the event where we're basically, um, white label a whole bunch of like $40 million software company for free when they have a click funnel to count, like it's insane. Um, and so that right now, uh, just we did the, we did a launch during, uh, during black Friday and it crushed. It was insane. Probably the highest converting offer I've ever done. And now we just this week are rolling it out as, um, uh, as a, as live ever green. So, um, boom, number one, break even funnel. Okay. If I was to go to create new business, in fact, a good example of secrets of success is the side business I have, right? My number one focus post FHL is to get, uh, a break even funnel in that business. And so I'm going to try two or three. I get one's like, boom, this is the one that can scale. Um, same thing with magnetic marketing, Dan Kennedy's business. Like my number one focus post FHL is getting a break even funnel. So for you guys, like number one thing for this year is you have to have a funnel where you can spend money profitably to get customers. Otherwise you're in trouble. Okay. Now, if you're waiting to build this phone, like you need to go test a bunch of things. Like now is the time to go build a break even funnel. It is the key. They will unlock all the freedom, all the success, all the growth, all the things you need. Okay. Um, my ability to grow and scale click throws right now is second to none. Uh, better than's ever been in the past. Right. Like if I'm going to be there, we're also nothing to anything other than having a good solid front end break even funnel. I can scale through paid ads. Like that is the key. That's how you win this game. Nothing else actually matters that much. Okay. All right. That's thing number one. Okay. You're right. Thing number two thing, number two is what is your key metric? I lost sight of this. Um, in your business, you have a key metric and mine has shifted over the years. In fact, I remember, um, when I was first growing my business, this is man, pre-click funnels, uh, I had, I had built a business. It kind of collapsed. I was like back in the rebuilding phase and a really cool call with, uh, my buddy, Dagan Smith, and we're talking about, you know, our businesses and growing and stuff like that. And Dagan asked me this question. It was so cool. He said, how many people joined your list today? You dropped that today. Cause you say, how many joined your list? Oh, I got a hundred thousand people on my list. You know, how many joined your list today? And I didn't know. It's like, I don't, uh, I'm not sure. Let me see. So logged into my, whatever, I think I had a web or a type of a web account. It was like six is that I'm going to join today. I'm like six. He's like, Oh, that was your problem. I'm like, what do you mean? It's like, he's like, dude, your only focus should be how many people are joining your list every day. Like how many joined your list every day? He's like, and you logged in and it was like 3000 something. And he's like, this happens every day. He's like, my focus is this is building my list, building my list, building my list. And this is what he told me that, then that became our focus. I told my entire team, all right, only matters how many people joined our list today, what's crazy about it. As soon as you look at something, um, like it'll grow. It's, it's crazy. And so it's just like, because it's back in my life. Okay. Well, how do I get more people list? What do I need to do? Oh, I need to do a, uh, I do a podcast, but instead of just doing a podcast, I do a podcast and I give a call to action, right? Instead of doing Facebook lab, I do a Facebook lab and I call the action. Instead of just going, you know, like you just start thinking differently. So you start focusing. And I remember when we shifted our focus, how many people joined list day went from six, you know, to like, to like 50 a day, to a hundred a day, to a thousand a day, to 5,000 a day, to 10,000 a day, like where it became the focus. Okay. We want to click funnels. Um, archymetric shift, archymetric was how many, uh, trials that we get today. When that became the focus, guess what happened? We got way more trials and we started this, this run to remember, we want our goals. I get to a hundred thousand active members. And so, um, that was like on all the TVs in the office, everyone saw it every silly was like the thing we talked about every meeting is like, how many people each year are joining, how many people we have, how many to a hundred thousand. And that became the focus for, right? We blew up spot, spot. We hit past a hundred thousand active members and blew up beyond that. And then after it passed a hundred thousand, I stopped focusing on it. We hit the goal. It's crazy. And it's been like four or five years as I focused on that goal. And because of that, like, because no one's focusing on that as the goal, like the goal post moved and just kind of like settled down, right? Now we're not at a hundred, we're below a hundred thousand active members. Like, and so it's coming back to like, what is your key metric? Okay. So the click from his business is how many people are active on click funnels. Like, so how many trials are we getting today? Like that becomes so in a click-throws business. That is the key metric. We're bringing it back to that. We'd forgotten about it. I was like, bringing that back. That is the only thing that matters. Okay. And selling online, sorry, the, the prime mover side of the business, right? It's different. That was like how many tickets that we sold? How many people are going to be on this, this month's live challenge? Okay. And so my goal is how I want to have 5,000 people every single month doing the selling online challenge. Right now we're about, you know, 2,500 to 3,000 to join every single month. So I'm about halfway with our entire team. We all know like everything from social to ads, everything's like, we need 5,000 people a month on this thing for our numbers to work. Right. And so those are the key, the two key metrics for two key businesses. Okay. Um, all right. So that's number two is what is your key metric? Okay. I don't care what it is, but it's got to be the thing that drives your growth. It needs to be something that's literally on your wall every single day. You see it when you wake up in the morning, if you got a team, that's the first thing ever is asking how many people joined the thing last night. Right. If you don't have a team, then it's like you're yourself asking like, how do you join the thing last night? Like that's the only thing that actually matters in your business. Okay. Everything else is just a byproduct of that, not only what your key metric is. Okay. And by the way, your breaking funnel step number one should be the thing that's fueling your key number two metric. Okay. All right. One, two. Number three. I just wrote really big in all bold caps, promotion, promoting, promoting, promoting, promoting. Okay. Too many times us as creators, we create something and then we move to create something else. We have to focus on promotion of the thing we have promotion, promotion, promotion. Okay. I've got three of arguably the greatest marketing books of all time. Dotcom, X, Psygnes, traffic secrets. I'm not focused on promoting those in a long, long, long time. So we just rebuilt the funnels. Uh, and now I'm coming back to promotion of the K promotion. You hear me talking about more often like motion, promotion, promotion. Right. I'm doing more Facebook lives than getting like, I'm doing more podcast episodes. I'm getting other people's podcast episodes. Like I'm, I'm speaking more events. Like I got to get back into the promotion game. Same thing for you every single day. How, how, like, how are you promoting yourself today? I remember a couple of years ago, my friend, um, uh, one of my friends, he, uh, it was January 1st and he, um, he, he posted a thing. It was like, how many, he's like, my goal is to get, I have a PowerPoint side of it, where I walked in when he did, but it was like, he was going to try to do, um, a thousand live presentations and, um, or a thousand speeches that year or something. And he said, I'd find a speech where there's me and at least two other people. Right. It's going to be one to two, one to five, one to a hundred, but it's like a one to many presentation. And he said the goal is I can't remember. I wish I wish I pulled, I think it was a thousand though for the year he wanted to do. So we put it out first day. It was like January 1st. I smoked like my list. Like, you know, I, I'd one, one out of one in the February, I did this and get, or January 2nd, January 3rd, every day post publicly, how many, um, uh, how many speeches he had given and just to start doing that. And people start messing like, Hey, we want to speak to my audience. Once you're not sitting to my audience and by like, by the time he's in March, he's getting like six, seven, eight speeches a day where he's doing a podcast here. He's doing a Facebook live, this group. He's talking to these guys, uh, you know, this group over here. He's doing, you know, just like, and it was, it was just him doing this kind of stuff and made me remember like, we got to focus more on promotion, promotion, promotion, promotion. Right. How are you frowning your business today? I give you all the time, like I'm working on my funnel, I'm in the launch, my funnel, I'm like, okay, that's great, but you got to be promoting at the same time. Right. If you're not doing active promotion, when your funnel's ready, no one's going to be there to buy. Okay. Promotion is a consistent, constant, consistent things happening every single day. Okay. So if you're where are the places that you can talk, you can promote and then be there as much as you possibly can. Okay. Promotion, promotion, promotion. Um, all right. So number one is breaking fiddles. Number two, uh, figure a key metric. Number three is constant, consistent promotion. Number four. Okay. And this is something that's going to be a little controversial. You got to focus on ad creative over social. Okay. I've been doing social game for a long time. I got a million plus followers on, on Facebook and on Instagram, another million and on YouTube. We got 400,000. What's crazy. I love social and maybe I just suck at social. That's definitely a possibility. Um, there are people who are killing on social. Um, but for the amount of effort I put into social and the number of leads to come back and the number of sales and trials and stuff, like it's not bad, but it's not good. Okay. And when I put that same effort into ad creative, um, those make me way more money. It's crazy. Um, I was looking at like how many hours a week I do creating social. I get it. I can see this podcast, YouTube channel, these things like, these are all social things I'm doing. They're all great. Okay. And they're good for a long term, consistently good for building brand, good for connection with the audience, all sorts of stuff. But if you want to make money, it's creating ads. Okay. Last Friday we sat there. I spent four hours just creating ads ad after ad after ad after ad. Those ads get plugged in and instantly they turn into more money. Social eventually turns into more money ads instantly. Okay. So focusing on ad creative over social. Okay. For every hour you're putting into social, you should be putting an hour into ad creative. If you do that, watch how your business changes. Okay. You'll get like really good offers. The, the reality is, um, with really good offers, the difference between offers doing good and doing great is how much, like how much creative you have going towards that. In fact, a really good story. Uh, Dean Gross, the OC and I, we both launched a book about same time. I had expert secrets and he launched millionaire success habits. And we were, you know, we basically had very similar funnels. He had funnel hacked my funnel. So his funnel looked like mine. Um, and we were the kind of sharing stats back and forth. It was crazy is that, um, he had spent, he was getting four times that they booked cells as I was having. And we couldn't figure it out. Like even I asked him, he's like, I don't know. We're looking at stuff. And finally I was like, can I come down and let's just spend a day with my team and your team. It was just like, let's kind of coach each other and look at everything. He's like, sure, come on down. So we, uh, we flew down there and went through all his numbers as analytics is everything. And when all of a sudden done, we found out is the only difference between Dean and me was Dean was creating four times more creative than I was. That's it. Okay. For every ad I made, he was making four ads and it was interesting cause uh, Dean's from the infomercial and he told me he's like back and he's like, I would do an infomercial and he's like, um, one infomercial last for 18 months before it would get ad fatigue and have to go record new one. He's like with ads on Facebook and Google was like, it's like six days. So you're going to keep creating, taking a lot of credit and you know, which one's going to work and which one's not going to work. And then what's interesting, he told me, he's like, when you find the message that works, then you can double down. And so like he was showing us, he ended up selling, I think during this campaign, like four or 500,000 copies of his book, which is crazy for a book. Um, but he's like, he's like, it took me like six months to get the right hook. If you add, add, add, add eventually, like just one of the ad credits he did. Boom. The hook landed. He's like, Oh, that's the hook. And they did all the ads afterwards using that same hook. And that's when it blew up. So for me, it was selling online. Guess what I'm doing once a month. I'm going to create a whole bunch to add creative, right? Cause we're like, we're running this live event every single 30 days, every single month. So I need new ads and so I'm doing new ads and so like every month it's like, Oh, that one worked. That one didn't work. This one did. And it's like, I'm learning like this is the messaging that gets people to sign up for this event. Okay. So I'm putting more time into ad creative, ad creative, ad creative. So number four is ad creative over social for every hour you put in socials, putting hours to ad creative, uh, because the ad creative will pay off instantly, social pays off over long term. So you still want to do both, but folks in ad creative over social. All right. Number five, I wrote curiosity. You've got to become curious. I don't know what it is about people. Maybe since I'm so curious, but people drive me nuts. Okay. So for example, I feel company all the time in my real world and, um, and they're like, wow, I'm actually making a lot of money. And, uh, that's it. They never say, what are you doing? Like, how do you do this? Okay. You guys remember, um, the movie, uh, pursuit of happiness, Will Smith and he's coming down and he's out from building in the stock broker pulls up and like something's saying car and he gets out. Will Smith's like, what do you do? And how do you do it? Right. I got to figure that out. And he went and did it. Right. Same thing. If you watch the Wolf of Wall Street where, um, uh, what's his name, uh, Jonah, Jonah Hills character, when, uh, he's talking to Leonardo Caprio and he's like, he's like, uh, you show me a pace or he's like, what are you doing? It's like, I'm a stock broker. How much money make you like, uh, $50,000 a week. He's like, you show me a pace sub with you make $50,000 a week. I quit my job right now and, uh, I come work for you. He shows him the thing in the next scene. Like, yeah, I quit and hangs up anyway. Like it's crazy to me how not curious people are. If you come to somebody, you find them and they're making more money than you. You should be so curious. Like, what are you doing? How are you doing it? You find someone who is in better shape than you. You need to become extremely curious. What are you doing? How are you doing? What's the program? What's the protocol? I need to understand. Like, you know something I don't know. I need to know. Okay. When, when somebody's doing something amazing that you want to be like or you want to understand, like you have to become insanely curious. I can't tell you how many tens of thousands of people I've met who come into my world or they meet me or something and, uh, and they're like, they'll ask me like, wow, what do you do? I'm like, oh, I started all my business and then they don't, they don't follow up. Oh, nice. And they stop. I'm like, you guys, this is like it, it blows my mind. Um, the people that are the most successful at all areas of life and the people who are the most curious, you have to become more curious. What is this? Like what's happening? What's working? Why is it working? Okay. I think one of the things I find interesting is people who come into my world who want to learn how to grow businesses, do funnels, all that kind of stuff. Um, the ones who want to just come make money, they're not curious. They just like, how do I make money? And they try to do something. They struggle. The ones who get curious, how does this work? Like what is it? Like, I want to understand the psychology and the marketing, the business. Like once you get curious about it, those are the ones that have success. Right. Cause they build a foundation that have success. It helps me successful. Right. It's not like, like maybe someone six pack abs, like how do you do that? And then they give you a list of their other recipes that they eat and then like you try to do that. Like you're not going to be successful. Right. You gotta understand everything. Like their mindset, why they do it and how it works and how they structure the day. And like you gotta get deep into their mindset. So we need to become more curious, um, about the people and the things that are having success in the world that we want to be in. Okay. Um, we're, we're always talking about modeling success, but it's more than that. It's like, it's like, figure out who you're going to model and then becoming extremely curious. Like what are they doing and how are they doing it? Why are they doing it? Asking a lot of questions. Okay. Um, do you see someone like when I see someone on social who's having, I see something blown up and I, like I do this all the time. In fact, if any of you guys are out there, you know, this, if I've seen yourself, like I'll see like an ad or a video or something is going by or something. I love it. I'm messing with people. Like, dude, your ads off. That's so cool. How'd you know where's your idea? Did yours? It was it an agency. Like I start asking these questions, right? And it's how it opens up all these doors for me. Okay. Extreme curiosity. The more curiosity I have, the more likely you are going to be to have success. Okay. So start asking more questions. If someone has what you want, um, or has something you desire, don't say, oh, nice, like drill them, right? Think about Will Smith, uh, pursuit of happiness, right? Like what do you do and how do you do it? Okay. Or Jonah Hill, right? Um, you show me a check with $70,000. I quit my job right now. I can work for you. That's the kind of mentality. That's kind of curiosity. You have to have to be successful in this game. Okay. All right. And then number six achievers never quit. Okay. That's it. If you want to be successful, you have to stop stopping. Okay. Achievers do not quit. I think about this all the time. Like, um, I don't know. I'm a, I'm a hyper intense achiever. Right. I'm a high achiever. Um, I love achieving it. Like it's one of my few things that fuel me. Right. Um, I want to win at everything. So I was wrestling, like, um, it was crazy to me. Like I'm going to the wrestling room and we have all these people coming in and. And just people like, I don't know, it was just crazy to me. Like they come in, it gets hard. They quit, they quit, they quit, they quit. Like you come in the wrestling room on the very first day of practice. The room's so jammed, nobody could fit there. Within a month, like a fourth of a gone within two months, half of a gone by in the season is like a third of the people are left, right? And it just blows my mind. How many people quit? And it's like, do you want to know why you're not successful in areas of life? Cause you quit. It's just insane to me. Right. I see it in business too. People come in and they dabble, they dabble and they quit. Right. Like if you want to, if you want to win this game, like this is the, this is not a short term game, like how do I get rich quick? No, no, no, no. This is the game for achievers. Right. You come in the thing that makes you an achiever is that you don't quit. Right. You're curious and you don't quit and you try and you fail and you try and you fail and you try and you like, that's, that's the key. Um, uh, I saw a kid, uh, this guy gave him this speech the other day and, um, great kid, um, but he was someone who came in the wrestling room and he worked out for two months, then he quit. I just saw him and I was just like, I mean, I could quit and it's like, now that he's done that, like in all areas of his life, now he's got an outlet. It's like, Oh, I quit wrestling and quit this. I quit, like you've got to stop quitting at things. Um, I don't know. I think one of the reasons why I've been so successful is like, I don't quit. Right. Like I think about wrestling and wrestling put you under the most extreme, um, the most extreme situations of any human on this planet. I think, I don't know. Uh, I mean, I look at like what wrestling practice looks like. If you ever survive like a three hour wrestling practice and like division one level, like it is brutal. It's hard to compete. It's hard to survive. But imagine doing that while cutting weight, which means you have eaten and eaten a drink in three days and you still have to walk into that room and perform at a high level. Right. With plastics on and sweats on while you were trying to cut weight. Right. Like there's so many times I would love to quit like over and over and over again. Right. So as people just quit, right? But I, but I didn't quit. Right. And so I have this thing in my head. Like I don't have it. I don't have the ability to quit. Like that's not an option. I don't give myself that option. Right. Um, I think about just last four years of, of my journey. Okay. You look at like when we launched click phones, we're growing and everyone's cheering because they love the underdog story and you're growing. And then we get to the top and the second we stumble, everyone comes attacking, everyone comes throwing stuff at like, like, man, I could have quit earlier and left on a high with a hole with, you know, $100 million in my pocket and be like, peace. I'm out. Right. But instead, because I decided to continue to serve the second I stumbled, then everyone wants to like throw their cheap shots in and it's insane. Right. I could have quit a million times long way. I wanted to quit sometimes. Right. But I don't quit. Sheavers don't quit. Right. If you want to win this game or the game of life as a whole, you have to stop quitting. Um, and so those are the, those are the things, um, this year that I wanted to kind of bring to your, to your plate to think about on success. Right. If you want to be successful in 2025, like, um, this game is fun. Like I love it. I'm still obsessed with it. Uh, there are times when I'm tired and it's brutal. It's ups and the downs, all sorts of stuff, but, um, I love this game. Right. And so think about it. So things to focus on, right? Number one, uh, again, break even fun. You need to break even follow up your business. You should be obsessed with creating funnel after funnel to funnel till you got one. Okay. You probably noticed I just try one following and didn't work on what to do now. Right. Like how, I don't go back to my email list. You guys are my email list. How many funnels I launched in the last 12 months? I promise it's a lot more than you did. Okay. Well, Russell, you have like, no, no, no, no. If I'm going to launch 12 funnels this year to find one break in from how many you do to launch, you might launch 20. Okay. Cause I'm pretty dang good at this game, but it took me a lot of fun to get one that I can now scale. Okay. Which means you got to pick up speed. You got to stop slowing down. You got to stop like wasting time and thinking about it. And like, if you got to put some stuff, you got to put stuff out there. Okay. I was just a joke about this. You had a bunch of crap, throw the wall and see which things going to stick. Okay. Most of you guys sitting there like pile of crap, like, I don't know. Should I throw it? I don't know. I'm just going to think about it. Like what if someone makes fun of me, what if it doesn't work? Well, and you're just like holding this bike, throw it and then see the try again and try again and try again. Right. You got to find out what the breaking funnels is going to grow for you and scale. But you don't know until you go out there and you actually do it. Okay. Number one is breaking from number two, figuring key metric every morning, waking up, looking at metric, knowing what it is. So you start focusing on it. It will grow. Okay. Say that everything you focus on will grow except for your waistline. Which actually shrink when you focus on it because you're trying to lose weight. Right. But everything else when you focus on it, it grows. So figure out the key driving metric in your business. Is it options? Is it sales? Is it trials? Like what is the thing for you? Okay. For me, it's easy trials over in click phones business, ticket sales over here in this, in the, um, the prime mover business. That's it. Those are the two metrics. All matters every single day. Day in and day out. Okay. Number three promotion. We came every morning thinking about, I got to promote. I got to promote. I got to promote. Uh, I was talking to a friend yesterday about PT Barnum. I have PT Barnum's actual pocket watch and I was telling him about it at church. And, uh, I was like, yeah, I got PT Barnum's pocket watch. He's like, that's so cool. And it's like, why are you collecting PT Barnum stuff? I was like PT Barnum's one of the greatest promoters of all time. I'm like, you know, he knows I run a business boy. I'm like, that's like promotions. Like the key to success in this business. Right. Like I love Barnum because of promotion. Like, like I study him. I'll read his books. I studied what he did because he's a great promoter. Like we got to become great promoters. Okay. Number four ad creative over social for every hour you put it into socially. You got to spend least hour creating ads. Um, so you can find the hooks. You have enough creative to be able to scale when you do have a funnel. It's going to be a break even. Okay. Number five curiosity becoming like obscenely curious when somebody's got something you don't have and figure out how they do it, why they do it. Reverse engineer asking questions. Like do whatever it takes to be able to figure out what that thing is. And number six, achievers never quit. Stop quitting. Okay. Go stand in the fire for a little bit, throw some fists and just know you don't have an outlet. Don't give yourself, I don't let yourself off the hook. Okay. If you're struggling to laugh right now, my guess is you probably let yourself off the more than once. It's time to stop. Okay. There is no turning back. Like this is it. You're in the fire. You chose come on this path. You feel called to be here and you got to step into that and lean into it and do not stop. Okay. Cause achievers never quit. Those are my six things for you as I hope that was helpful for you. Um, a couple other things, uh, depending where you're listening to this, we are less than a month away from the last ever funnel hacking live. Um, I'm excited for it. I'm sad about it.

I'll talk about the plan of fun like that. Couldn't find a lot. I'll tell you what's happening, uh, but this is the last one. I can live and do not want to miss it.
