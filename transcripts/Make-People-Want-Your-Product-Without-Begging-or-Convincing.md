What's up everybody? This is Russell. Welcome back to the podcast. Excited to have you guys here and excited for this new format. I've really been enjoying it and actually got a really good feedback from you guys so far. So unless something else changes, we're going to keep on going down this path, which would be a lot of fun. Me just kind of picking topics I want to geek out on in different areas. So today's topic I want to talk about is desire. But what's interesting is I want to talk about this from different, like probably two different standpoints. One from you as a marketer who's trying to create desire in the hearts of people you are selling because more desire to have the thing you're selling, the more likely they are to buy. But number two, how do you create desire in your own heart, right? In your own body, in your own thing, like you know you should be desiring this thing, but you're not like, how do you, how do you create desire? And then on top of that, how do you influence people? Like it's kind of a multi-purpose thing. So I don't know if this one's categorized under Secrets of Success or marketing secrets are selling, but it's kind of a, it's kind of a blend of all those. But it's been something that's been in my mind a lot recently for a lot of standpoints. You know, obviously, I think it, for me, it stems off of, I mean, honestly, number one is my kids. Like I love my kids. They are the coolest people in the world. But they are also for me, the hardest people to influence, like and to help and to guide and to teach. And it's so weird to me, you know, like all people who pay me insane amounts of money for me to give them my advice and my kids are like, dad knows nothing. I'm like, I swear, I know something. Like, you know, I'm sure you guys experience that if you have kids as well. It's really hard to be, what do you say? It's hard to be a profit in your own hometown, right? And so that's been that's been interesting. So I keep thinking about how do I create desire in my kids for stuff that's good, right? Stuff that they should have desired for, like, like God and like eating healthy and being like all these things I just like that I have huge desire for. They don't like, how do I influence them? How do I? Ah, it's hard, right? But then at the same time, it's OK, how like, how do I, the people I'm influencing, like my funnel hackers, my prime movers, the people I'm trying to help in their journey, like, how do I influence them? You know, they already have desire. How do I increase that desire so that they're more likely to actually fall through and actually do the things? And then on the third side for myself, it's like, I know there's things I should be doing that maybe I'm not doing is because I don't desire them. But I know I should be like, I got to be any healthy. Why don't I desire this? Like, how do I create desire and how do I amplify the desire? And like, and so that's what I've been thinking a lot about recently. And so anyway, that's that's kind of what I want to start this with. Just for you guys to kind of think about that for for yourself, say desire, because I just an important thing. I remember the first time I really had this. I think this realization I was so I'm a Mormon LDS. And so in our church, we have no paid clergy, right? So there's no there's no preacher who's up on stage. And so what happens is everyone in the audience gets a chance to talk. So once every three or four years, they'll call me on the phone, but hey, Russell, you want to speak today at church? I'm like, heck yeah. For me, it's like my favorite thing. Like I love anyway, if I had if I had one full time calling, it would be maybe to speak at church every single time. I should be a pastor. I love it anyway. I think I'm going to launch a podcast about that. In fact, I bought a reason to believe.com. So I think I'm going to do a podcast in the future that's more faith based because I love I love talking about and thinking about reading about. I know. So anyway, I was I was at this. I got asked to speak in church. This is probably 15 years ago and I got on stage and give my presentation. I'm looking at the audience. It was crazy. There was like five people you could tell had desire to learn. They were looking me excited and like happy faces. And then 95% of the audience is like half asleep. You know, and this is me like Russell Brunson teaching, which is, you know, I'm like all my energy, all my everything and like still most of them had no desire here for me. So they were kind of like dozed out versus there are people that desire like they were tuned in like I was able to run with them. And then I contrast that to my events like funnel hacking live, right? People who come to funnel hacking live, they already have a desire to learn stuff. So they show up like anything I say, they're like, this is amazing. And they freak out and it's so interesting. They so much easier to influence somebody who already has desire for the thing that you are offering them, right? For someone who doesn't have a desire for that. I think about like, I have friends coming to me like asking me health advice. Like, how do you do this? How do you do this? I'm like, oh, let me tell you, here's my morning routine. Here's my supplements. Here's my debt. And like they freak out, right? And then my kids, they're struggling with stuff. I'm like, Hey, you should like, let me, let me help you. Let me like, you know, and they just won't listen to anything. And so it's this weird thing where it's like, gosh, like, at least for me and for us, you're like, how do I implant desire into your brain so that I can help you because I can change your life if you would just allow me, but you have no desire to change life. Therefore I can't. And it's this weird thing. And so I thought a lot about, in fact, I talked to a client about it last night, I was just like, do you think it's possible to give people desire? And I'm going to do a whole scriptural study and I'm going to go deep in the name. So I don't know right now, top of it. So I don't know the answer to this, but I'm going to go research it. But, um, but my belief right now is I don't think it's possible for me to plan a desire in somebody's heart. I think that God is the person who plans desires. And I think that that we can nurture them. We can water them, we can help them grow. But I don't think we can, we necessarily plant a desire in someone's heart. Um, now I have some work around. So don't worry. I got some work grounds, I'm going to share with you guys here in a minute. So I do think it's possible, um, to, to, um, do some stuff around that. But I think that the actual seed has to be planted by God. I think about this because I think about, um, when I was a kid growing up, I remember, like in hindsight, Russell today, looking back on Russell, you know, as a 15 year old kid, I remember thinking books were stupid. I remember my mom taking me to the bookstore. Uh, maybe this is the stupidest thing. Why was someone going, I like, this is the most boring place on the planet. Why would I want to ever come here? Like I remember just being so annoyed with books and then fast forward now, 30, whatever years later, 30 years later, um, you know, I've bought 18,000 books in the last, um, you know, two years, every penny that I've earned, I'm dumping into building my own event center slash library slash museums. Like I'm looking at books and smell books and talking about books. So, uh, it's definitely, it's definitely, um, you know, it's definitely kind of a, a, a, a flip flop. But I think about this, like, like what caused that desire for me to do that. Right. And I don't think it's ever, initially it wasn't a desire for, um, actually reading. I was, I never came up like, Oh, I'm going to become a reader. That's the thing. You know, I'm going to go read. Like that wasn't a desire, but, um, but there was a desire planted in my heart. Right. And it was when I was, um, a kid, like I had this weird desire and you guys have heard of stories to my can go deep into it, but, um, watching it in full commercial, seeing someone talk about, you know, Don the pre-tech about making money or trying to classify it at this desire plan, but the desire was something, was a bigger thing. It was, I want to make money. I want to figure out how to make money. Right. So that was the desire and that was the seed that was planted. Um, and in the question, obviously it's like, why would God plan that seed? Like who does he actually care for? Also makes money. So I, I think I solved that, um, like 25 years later. So I'll explain that here in a minute, but, um, I get the seed of desire placed in my heart for me to make money. Right. And so I'm trying to figure out how to make money. And as a teenager, I'm trying all sorts of stuff. Right. So I'm trying a thousand ways to make money. None of them actually work. But then I get into college, right? Um, me and my wife, we're going to get married. Uh, I have nobody to support her. I want to keep wrestling. So all of a sudden like that seed that it planted before was like, why are you going to make money? So now that seeds there and our desire and desire starts growing. How do I make money? And I figured this out. And so I started studying, started learning, started reading, you know, and so that, that seed started to grow and started to develop and started getting bigger. So that desire went from it's little tiny, like, oh, it'd be fun to make some money. It's like, I've got to figure out how to make money for my family. Right. And as that seed started growing, um, then, um, then like ancillary seeds started growing as well, not, um, but not on purpose, but it's because they were the things I needed to actually make the money. Right. So the desire is making money, but then like I was trying different things. I was flipping things on eBay. I was, you know, I was, uh, trying to sell stuff on Craigslist. Like I was doing all these different things. And then in that process of trying to figure out different things, um, I started like finding like ebooks about like, here's how to make money. And I started finding more things. And I started reading and started studying. And then, um, I remember, um, I built my first little business that I kind of set up there and I launched that I was making, I was making a couple hundred bucks here and there. And then, um, what's, uh, what's interesting is, um, uh, I went to an event. It was my, it was my very first big seminar, Armand Moran's big seminar. And I had a little business at the time. I showed up at the event and sitting there, uh, learning. And I remember there was a guy, Michael Fortin, is that they're speaking. And he was a conversion guy. Like he was a copywriter conversion guy and he's on stage talking. And I remember he started sharing some stats and some numbers about the split tests. I don't remember the, the details that, but I do remember one of them is like, you know, I, I was testing my headline, like a blue headline versus the red headline. I can't remember which one one, but one of them won by like whatever 30 or 40%. I was like, huh, that's interesting. So I went back to my, to my hotel room and I logged into front page of my computer. And I went and I edited the headline. I changed the color of the headline. But I did like a little split test. I can see which one converted. And sure enough, by changing the color of the headline on my page, it increased my conversions by whatever it was 30%. Let's say, um, which meant I started making 30% more money. Does that make sense? Like conversion of 30%. So same amount of traffic, 30% more money came in my bank account. I remember sitting there like a week later, I was like, that's insane. I learned something and then I applied it and I made 30%. Like I gave myself a raise, you know, like, and I was like, what? This knowledge is amazing. Like I learned something. I applied it. I made money. Like what else could I learn? So I remember getting a book. I was reading a book and most of the books flopping on the stories. Also there's like one little nugget. I took that nugget. I was like, huh. So I took that nugget. I applied it and made more money. I was like, this is insane. I learned something. I applied it. I made more money. Then remember, I'm like, I'm going to go to another seminar. So much to another seminar. I remember sitting there, sitting there for day number one. I was getting nothing, getting nothing. Also like speaker on day three, drop this little nugget. I was like, whoa, I took that nugget, applied it, made more money. I was like, this is insane. I just got a weed through all this content, all this stuff. If I find one little thing, it equals more money. Right. And so I became obsessed with this like passion. I started buying books and courses and everything. Every course came, I bought it. I devoured it. Devoured, not looking for like, I need this thing to change my life. I was like devouring it for one little nugget. I get one little nugget from a four day course. Boom, changes everything for me. Right. And we're going to seminars. I remember one seminar going to, and I was there for like two or three days. I'm like, I'm getting nothing, getting nothing. And then that night everyone's going out to the bars and I'm introverted. Russell, I'm Mormon. I don't drink. Everyone's going to this bar and they come on out and hang out. It's going to be fun. I'm like, ah, you know, and I was like, okay, but I'm like, I don't want it, people think I'm down there drinking. So how do I make this not, you know, like worst case, I want something like tell my wife, hey, I was on Russell the bar yesterday. You know, so I'm like, cool. I'm going to the bar, but don't worry. I'm not drinking. I just, everyone's going down there. I got to hang out with them. So I go down to the bar and the funniest story. I go down the bar and, um, and the bartender or whatever the person comes up and asks something to drink. And I was like, first of my head, I'm like, oh, I'll get a sprite. I'm like, ah, sprite looks like everyone else is drinking. I'm like, ah, it's fine. I was like, what does it look like when everyone else is drinking? I was like, can I order a milk? And he goes, you want a milk? Like, yeah. And he's like, yes. And so he can give me milk. So I'm holding this milk because the milk, at least in my mind, doesn't look like alcohol. So I don't, I want everyone to know that I'm not drinking. I'm drinking milk. And they were like, what are you drinking? I'm like, oh, it's milk. And they're like, what? I'm like, I'm more than I don't drink. So I'm drinking a milk. They're like, that's weird, but whatever. So I'm hanging out with these guys at the bar and the more drunk they get, the more they start talking, the more that they start sharing. And in a very short period of time, these guys are dropping this gold. I'm like, what? I'm scooping up the gold, going back home, implementing. I'm like, I'm making so much money. And so because of that, this desire for learning started going. Okay. The desire for money caused me to have a desire for learning. And then I started learning everywhere. It was books, courses, seminars, whatever it could be, right? And so I became a very, a voracious study or learner, not looking for like, this book's going to change. I think a lot of times people are like reading a book and they give me an activity, all this book has got regurgitated. He's like, who cares? I'm like, all I'm looking for one nugget. That's like fun, hot, people come. I mean, it's like a five, you know, four day of Memphis, a one day date with dad. Like, is it going to be worth it to come? Like I value learning so much in five days. If you can't get one nugget, it doubles your business. There's a problem with you. Okay. It's because you're not paying attention with the right ears. You're hoping someone's going to save you as opposed to someone's going to give you an idea that takes you down a path. Right. Like that's the difference. So I became obsessed with it. Right. And now I look at my life, like it's books, it's courses, seminars, it's learning, it's podcasts, it's like just voracious. Let's word. I'm voracious, voraciously looking for, looking for, for the thing. Right. And that's, that's, that's, that's like, that's who I am now. Right. And so that's how we created the desire. Okay. So those are some of the experiences my head I was going through as I'm trying to figure this out, like how do I create desire for my kids or for other people? Right. Because for me, it was, it was this, this, it wasn't a direct thing. Right. It was like, I'd desire for this bigger core value thing that I wanted. And then from there, there were things that I had to do to be able to achieve that value. And I started increasing the value around those. And then because I did that, it increased, it got me the value I wanted at the end of the day. Does that make sense? Okay. And then I, I, I hinted about this earlier, so I'm just kind of bring back and talk about it. So it was interesting. Um, this was FHL 2017, I think we're in Orlando. And it was the very first time we introduced Operation Underground Railroad. So Tim Ballard came and we filmed a documentary. He came on stage. We shared the whole thing. Uh, we were all crying. It was crazy. We ended up raising a million dollars for Operation Underground Railroad. And remember, if you do the math, uh, Tim told us on average, it costs, it costs about $2,500 to save a child and then there's 7,500 to rehab. And so you'll get 10 grand, save the kids. So if you get to what's the math on that, so let's say, uh, boom, 100. So like it, in theory, it's the equivalent of saving and rehabbing a hundred children from sex slavery. Right. And so we do this whole thing and, and it's crazy. And I'm thinking about, I'm thinking about everything that led me up to that moment in my life, right? I'm thinking about, you know, when I was in college and when I was in like 14 year old kid and I wanted to like study, like I was watching infomercials when I make money. And then in a college kid, when I got these, these things placed my mind where I started caring about marketing and sales and advertising, like why would God care about Russell, 20 year old Russell, 21 year old Russell, whatever it was, like geeking out on this, why was like that desire placed in my heart when I was failing through school, barely complete, you know, barely having success, didn't like reading it all. So I was like, Hey, Russell, you're going to actually care about marketing. When you learn about marketing, you're going to become obsessed with it. You learn about sales, you're going to become obsessed with it. Why was that seed planted in my heart? And I don't know. Right. But I do know that 18 years later, 20 years later, whatever it was, God was using that desire he planted in my heart. Right. He let me develop it through things I was passionate about and excited about. But then later he allowed me to use that in a way that, that I think he called me to do, right, help a hundred kids from sex slavery through this organization that we were at that we were supporting. Right. Um, I think about all the time. Like a lot of times like, why did God give me this, this thing like wrestling is an example, like why was, like, why was that desire planted in my heart? Why was I so obsessed with wrestling? Why was it a decade of my life? That's all I did. Right. I wrestled, I lifted weights, I cut weight, I competed, I went to tournaments, I went to camps, like why was a decade of my life like consumed with that? Right. Now, if you look at my life now, like, I'm not a wrestler, I'm not, you know, I'm not coaching wrestling. Why did I spend 10 years of my life doing that? It's like, well, God planted that seed in my heart because there were things I had to learn through wrestling. Right. Like the reason why I'm as crazy as I am today, there's like an outwork everybody on this planet. The reason why I'm successful is because of my wrestling. Right. In wrestling, I learned how to like, how do you go four days without water or food while competing and practicing and running and lifting weights so you can compete at a weight 20 pounds lower than you actually weigh on Thursday and do that every single week for eight years of your life. Right. Like, um, like I did, I did things in wrestling that if most humans tried to experience it, they would crumble under the pressure of it. Right. And I look at that. Like, and I was doing consistently day in and day out, day in and day out. I remember sitting like my high school, our wrestling was below the basketball court. So I remember like in wrestling practice, we'd be done with a two and a half hour, three hour practice. We'd wrap ourselves in plastics and when we'd be running, working out, getting the, like the heaviest sweat possible. And then we'd jump under the mats and we'd roll ourselves up in the mats to like, to, to, um, constrict all the heat. So we'd sweat more and I'm doing this while I'm listening upstairs, the basketball players running around playing basketball, getting the drinks of water, eating lunch and breakfast and dinner. Three meals a day. They got to eat while I'm down there. I've needed three days. I've been drinking in two days and right now I'm sweating eight to 10 pounds an hour out of my body, like so that I can make weight this week so I can compete for six minutes. Right. Like that's what I had to go through. And so like, why did I go through that? Right. It was like, well, because in the future, Russell, you're going to be called to lead a movement and to change people's lives and to build a company and a business and there's going to be times that it is going to be brutal. It is going to be harsh. You got people who you thought were your friends, turn their backs against you. Right. But guess what? None of that's as hard as what I did in wrestling. Right. I learned how to, how to, how to endure that and succeed through that pressure because this pressure is simple compared to that. Right. And so God gave me the desire to learn wrestling so that someday I could be worthy and able to handle this calling. Right. And so I think about that a lot. And so for me, it's like, um, those are seeds who are planted that don't make any sense in the short term, but when you look at your life as a grand scheme of things, it's like, Oh, these things all make sense. Right. Okay. So there's desire. So again, it doesn't always make sense. Why does God plant these things? How do we get there? And then secondarily, how can I help give other people desire? And that's the hardest thing. So step number one, or so I have some steps here. Um, but, but I think the, the thing I want to, I want to argue or discuss in this podcast and get your thoughts on, get you like, get you guys thinking about as well. It's just like, how do we do that? How do we create desire in ourselves for things we know we want? How do we create desire in the hearts of people we love and serve? Our kids could be our audience, could be our whatever. How do we play? How do we, how do we create those desires? How do we amplify the desires to help people in our world to be more successful? That's the question. Um, so I don't know the answer, but I have some steps that based on my experience of 44 years, almost 45, my birthday is coming up, um, uh, years of my life, but I've kind of figured out, and so it's my best guess today. Um, I'm going to keep developing this idea over time, but hopefully this will be, um, useful for you guys that you're trying to figure out as well. Okay. All right. So this is my thoughts and, uh, step number one, I got three steps here. Okay. So step number one. Um, because I don't think that we can manually plant desires in someone's heart. I think the first step is figuring out what does somebody already have the desire for what desires already been planted in their heart. Okay. That's the first step. Okay. Cause think about me. Like I already had a desire in my heart to learn how to make money. That desire was already there. So for me to, you know, so you got to get assessed with marketing and funnels and things like that, like, well, like it's hard for me to like, you should be obsessed with funnels. Like why? Like, cause they're awesome. Like, I can't plant that desire in your heart, but if you've got a desire for, for bills or wealth or getting out of pain or whatever, like, if you have some of there's value, um, if I can identify what that is, then I can work my way into that. I can increase desire for the thing I want by knowing what your core value is. Okay. The core thing you are desiring. So the first question is what do you already have desire for the single for you? If you're trying to let yourself or for the person you are trying to influence your kids, your audience, whatever, right? Okay. So what do you already have a desire for? Now, uh, think about this and like, like what are desires, right? Desires are the things that we value the most, right? Um, and it's fun right now. And in, uh, inside of our company, I think I told you, as we split our company into there's the ClickForce company and the Prime mover, which is the info coaching side of business. So still same business. We kind of separated them into two, two units that work together, but they're separate business entities. And I tell them that we see different CEOs for each company just because they're different, uh, focuses and stuff like that. Um, and so with the Prime mover company, we're working right now. I was like, what are our company values? Which has been really fun kind of putting those together and figures out and identifying what the things are, right? And how they're different from other things we've done. It's not a big question. And so, um, I started thinking about like, well, what are the things that, that I value personally, right? Or my kids value. And so, um, I did this, um, it was master, it was a mastermind in paradise. We do mastermind. This is three or four years ago now. We're down in Mexico and I, I did this really fun experience with everybody. It was, it was one of the coolest things. I think someday I'll do it again. Um, even when the new event center has done all these special bed around this, they're really cool, but, um, I, I just cool exercise and I learned this. And, um, initially from my friend, Tal, Tuss, funny, he's, um, the, the head of the iron ran, um, foundation. He's awesome. And, um, he was telling me this exercise he did with people. So I did it for our audience. So the first thing we did is we created, we tried to figure out what do people actually value, like what are the things they value the most things they the most desire for, right? So I did it in the, in, uh, in this, um, this event is I gave everybody a pack of sticky notes. I said, I want you as fast as you can. Top of your mind, like, what are the things that bring the most happiness in your life, the things that are the best, right? Things you value the most. I said, right now, I'm sticking out and then as fast as you can, sort of laying out on these like little poster boards, right? Everyone down, they started writing it out. I did the same thing. And so I was up on stage, I had a big old whiteboard, sort of write down, like things that I value, I value reading, learning, understanding, religion, God, I value, um, uh, growth and value health, like value, such a list as many things I can, like hundreds of rice, fast as we can. So listing them all out, putting all the sticky notes all over and I had a whole whiteboard of all these sticky notes, right? And everybody else did the same thing. Now, by the way, uh, like a month later, we were at spring break with my kids. I do the same experience with them, which is really cool. So I get them all sticky notes, like everything brings you happiness. Everything that you're excited about, like write it down. So they're all writing down. And so we spent, you know, 15, 20 minutes, right? And down as many different values as we could, right? Now, it's how costs calls this a value galaxy. So with this big, that galaxy of all the things that we value, right? And so that's step number one, which is really fun. So you can do it for yourself. Okay. This is going to help you learn a lot about yourself. Um, you can also do it with, again, people, your influence. So that's step number one. And step number two is then you look at these value galaxies. So you might have 50 or a hundred different things that you value. They're exciting, right? We start looking at them. You'll notice that these things will kind of group into, uh, what, what, what tal, tal calls value themes. Okay. So what happens is like, okay, all these, these 20 here are all, if you look at those, they're all tied like my health and fitness, right? So I'm going to put all those things together. And like, this is the theme was health and fitness, right? And underneath that, there's, there's 20 things making me happy, right? Okay. And over here, I'm going to take, these are about, um, about religion, about faith, right? And so I take these and these 15 things I'm going to put them together. And these are all, um, faith. So that becomes a value theme is faith. And I find another one. So for, for everybody, I said, do that. And you should be able to find five or six value themes will start popping out for you. Right. So putting together, we find these different value themes also. It's like, cool, I have these value themes. Um, and so, um, we have those, we have those different themes. Um, and now based on that, now it's like, okay, now I know here's the five or six things that I value the most. Okay. And so that's what we did to figure out what the values were. And then this is the coolest part at the next co we did is that I said, you know, like the, the, um, I think I had ran said that like, um, the pursuit of our values is the thing that actually brings us happiness. Right. It's not, it's not the achievement. It's not the goal. It's like the pursuit of our values is what brings us happiness. I said, based on that, it's like, when I die, when all of a sudden that I die, I'm on my death bed. Like the questions like, did I, not that I hit this goal, I made a million dollars. I fell it out. It's like, like in the sincere pursuit of my values, was I successful? And so I had everyone write an obituary as if the, the core five or six value things that they, they, uh, had designed had actually come true. And this is your obituary. And then I wrote mine and it was crazy. Cause I, I knew I was doing this for like two months. So I was preparing for the event. I was too scared to write mine. And the morning of I was like, I have to write that. So I sat down and I wrote out my obituary and then, um, I stood on stage and I read it. And I was like, bawling my eyes out. It was basically me taking my value things and like saying, you know, Russell Bruntz, like he valued faith and because of that, that, you know, and I went through it. I, and I did my obituary and then I had everybody else. We spent an hour had everybody take their value things from there, right? What they would want read or not obituary. Sorry, eulogy at the, uh, your eulogy. And so, uh, it was really powerful. Now I'm not gonna say if you guys, cause again, maybe when we launch the, um, our event center here, I'll do that with everybody who wants to come to be a really fun exercise, but, um, but from there, it helped me figure out like, what do you actually desire? These are the five or six values you have to use. I heard the most, right? And so that's, I think, I believe that's step number one, cause those values are already in us. They're planted, they're hard coded. They're in there. Um, you can, I think that over time, you can value more things and different things. There's things later in my life that I value more than I didn't, you know, 20 years ago, I think those things, they can keep blossoming and growing on the stagnant. Uh, but right now this snapshot of your life, you have these different value things. Okay. So you figure out those five or six things are okay for you or for your personal influencing. Okay. All right. That's step number one. What do you, what do you already have a desire for? Okay. What things you already valid, but already valuing. Then we transition now to step number two. Okay. Now we gotta figure out how do we connect the thing? That you, how do you connect this desire to the thing that will create the result? Okay. Typically a thing that you are selling or a thing you're trying to give your person that you love, he's not listening to you. Um, uh, there's a thing that will give them the thing they desire the most. Right. So for example, my kids are like, you need to be eating healthy. And they're like, I don't want to eat healthy. It tastes like garbage. I'm like, no, it doesn't. It's like we're fighting because we're fighting over the thing. Right. Uh, and I guess where I get, I headbutt with, with my kids. Sometimes it's my, myself like, I should be studying the scripts. Like, I don't want it. I'm boring. I don't want it. Like, I'm, I'm fighting over the thing versus stepping back and say, okay, how do I connect the thing that you actually want to this thing? Right. So I think about like, um, I don't want to throw my kids in the bus. They get so mad if I tell stories about them, but, uh, one of my kids, I'll even vague so that, um, so they don't, they don't get mad at me. But one of them, um, last night went into our gym, which we have a, the most insane gym ever on our yard and our kids hardly ever use it. It's anyway. Yeah. But they went in there and they, and they were working out and the girls are stuck and then that, that kid came back in and was like, and I was like, you work out this awesome. Like, yeah, I want to get abs. Boom. I figured out where they desire. They desire for whatever reason, abs, right? That's what they want. I said, okay, now I have a, like, now I know exactly what's been implanted. Okay. Now let me try to get a knee healthy. Now it's not like you need healthy. Like stop eating his garbage. Like, now it's like, they don't value that, right? Where they value the value apps. Okay. I know they value apps. Eating healthy is going to be peace. And now I've got a map. And I say, okay, they already desired this. Now, so we'll give them seven or two is figure out how to connect that desire to the thing that will create the result. Usually the thing is what we're trying to sell somebody on. Right. Here's the thing. Okay. We're trying to give them desire in the thing, but they don't have a desire in the thing they desire in their value. So I have to connect the desire of that thing to the result. Okay. This is just like me back in the day. Right. I didn't want to read or learn anything. And I go to the seminar, Michael Fortin's like, Hey, change the red to blue. I apply it and makes money. I was like, boom. Now I have desire for the thing learning. I love it. I'm obsessed with it prior. No, so I make money. Okay. The internal desire was making money as soon as I learned that like by doing the thing, it'll make me more money. I became obsessed with it. Okay. I think health was the same thing for me. Like I didn't care about health. Like my whole life I was wrestler, you know, awesome shape, seven cent body fat abs. Awesome. It was great. Then my rest of her ends the same weekend. My wife gets pregnant with twins. She starts eating for three. I started eating to keep up with her. And now I'm not exercising, working out and within, you know, whatever it's seven to eight months, uh, she gains 50, 60 pounds. I gave 50 or 60 pounds. We're having so much fun together, eating so great. And then she one day has two babies loses all the way. And I'm like sitting here chubby all myself. I'm like, Oh, this is not good. And thanks eight years, eight years. I didn't care about health. I was just over where my God. I guess I'm just a big guy now who cares. Let me know. Right. Do not desire it. Right. Until the pain became too hard. Like, oh, I, and, um, it's funny though, because I became the pain came too hard everything, but then I started. I decided I'm going to lose weight, but it was hard because I was hard to motivate myself and there was just, I didn't have a desire to do it. Um, but after I started doing it, I started shifting away. I was eating. It was crazy because what happens is I started, um, I started eating differently. I had skipped breakfast during lunch. I'd only proteins, no carbs and a dinner and have carbs. I'd be shifting this the way I was eating. What happened is my brain didn't get tired. I didn't get brain fog. And so I'm at the office all day and I used to go tell, you know, from nine till noon, I eat and then the rest of it's kind of fuzzy, nothing get done. Right. So I made less money. And by shifting my eating, all of a sudden guess what happened? My brain function the entire day. It was crazy. And then I got more production out of there. I got more stuff done every single day. I started making more money. I was like, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. You're saying if I get healthy, I'm going to make more money and I'm more energy and more things. Okay. Boom. I'm sold in that desire. I'm in on that because I want to make more money. Therefore health makes more money and I can tie the thing I'm trying to do to the desire to actually have. It's just my brain connects those things like this equals more money than it's like, boom, now that's that now I'm sorry for that as well, because it feeds the desire actually want. Okay. So it's it's it's connecting those dots between them. Okay. Same thing for me right now. Like, um, I've had times in my life where I'm really good at script. So you're good and bad, good and bad. Right. And then, um, anyway, man, this is like literally in the last couple of months, uh, again, cause I'll start and whatever. But I started thinking about like my desire, like when my core desires right now, I'm trying to figure out all truth, right? And this is like from all of us. So I personally love the health. Like, I'm like, what is like, what is the truth? Right. And so for me, it's like now I want to, I, that's man valuing. Right. Which is why I'm trying to learn to educate all this kind of stuff. And so for me, it's like, well, I want to start studying scriptures. And I want to not just mind, I want to study the Mormon scriptures. I want to say your book of Mormon Bible, New Testament, Old Testament, but I also want to study other scripture. I wanted to like, what are the Muslims believe? What do the Jews believe? What are they? I become obsessed with. I want to understand how they all fit together. Like it's become the most fascinating thing for me. Right. Cause it helps me like in my head, connect these things, understand. Like, like just the truth of everything. So because of this obsession over here, it's drawing into like now, like I'm loving the scriptures and, and other people's faiths. And like, uh, it's been so much fun. Right. Where before I was fighting it in her heart where this morning I was up early reading scriptures, having a great time because I've tied the thing and I've desired a thing to give me one. I'm actually looking over here. Does that make sense? I'm speaking, or boys, just just kind of a side tangent. Um, and, uh, the sides, there's a side tangent, but, um, you know, I'm not going to go political cause I've always got different beliefs here and there. Um, but one thing that's really cool is I become obsessed with like conspiracy theories a little bit and like, honest, obviously the GFK one. And last night as I'm recording this, uh, Trump signed the thing to release the GFK documents. Like I'm so sad and they give behind like, what's the actual truth in this thing? And so anyway, there's, there's a tangent. All right. I've got one more step here inside the three step system, but I have to jump on my LFA live call. I'm live with that a couple hundred people at, um, with one funnel way with crew. If you're not one funnel way, go to one funnel way.com. Go sign up. I'm going to jump on them. I got, I got an hour of Q and a with them. Then I'll come back and I'll tell you guys step number three here. Um, uh, which will be awesome. So step number three, then after we know step one, what is it? What do you already have desire for? So number two is to figure out how to connect that, that desire to the thing that will create the result, right? Which is usually the thing you're trying to sell them or persuade them or influence them on. Then from there, we'll move on to step number three. When I come back, I'll let you guys know what step number three is. Do you have a funnel, but it's not converting the problem. 99.9% of the time is your funnel is good, but you suck at selling. If you want to learn how to sell, so your phones will actually convert. They get a ticket to my next selling online event by clicking on the link in the description or go to selling online.com slash YouTube right now. All right, everybody, I'm back. Uh, I know for you, it's probably just a commercial break, but I just did an hour long Q and a with the OFA people and that's so much fun. And actually it was funny because maybe, maybe it's just because my mind was thinking about desires specifically right now, since we're talking about it. But it was interesting in the, in the conversation, somebody was asking about niching down, they said, my, my products help for everybody. And I said, yeah, but the reality is like, um, you know, it's hard to market to everybody. So instead you got to find different niche markets to kind of focus on, at least for your front end offers. I said, for example, in my world, you know, I have, uh, you know, one market that we, we serve with funnels are network marketers. I'm like, so I have a front end funnel that serves network marketers, but I make, we also, uh, help life coaches, my friend in this, that helps life coaches. And then we have front end that helps, uh, you know, local businesses. And so I kind of talked about that. And then my head, I was like, Oh my gosh, like we're doing our marketing every single day, right? Like, uh, a life coach has no desire for a funnel, but they do have a desire to grow their life coaching business. Therefore I tell them, I help them grow life coaching business, but then how do I do it? I do it through the thing, which is the funnel, right? Network marketers don't care about funnels. They care about growing the network marketing business. Cause that's the thing they've already been convinced is going to get them to the desire, which is probably more money, more freedom, whatever. And so then I got to convince them that my thing funnels is the thing to help them with their thing, which is that we're marketing, which helps them with the end desire they want, which is actually to grow a business or have freedom or whatever it might be. Whew. You see how this works, you guys, you understanding this? Okay. So recapping step from one, what do you, uh, what do you already have desire for step number two, figure out how to connect that desire to the thing that will create the result. Now that moves us to step number three, step number three is then how do we increase the desire for that thing? Desire amplification. That is the question. How do we do that? Um, and I don't know, again, there's probably a huge list of all the ways I'm gonna share with you guys a couple of ways that have helped me in my life. Okay. So the first thing I do to help me increase the desire for something is I think about it all of the time. Okay. I think back about, uh, myself, like when I, when I got into wrestling, I fell in love with wrestling and I wanted to become a wrestler and I wanted to be a state champion, then a national champion and all American, like it became obsessed, like I remember sitting there and everything else became a burden for me, like thinking about anything else was annoying. I remember sitting in class all day long and teachers are talking about who knows what and all I wanted to focus on was wrestling, like how do I win? What's the mood? How do I get my position? How do I? So all I thought about all day long at school, every day was wrestling. Even though teachers were talking, I was like distracted, like, ah, I got to pay attention to my past, the class and the second I was able to snap back into what I wanted to think I desired the most, which is wrestling. I did it, right? So the more I thought about the more I desired, the more it grew and like, and so like desire grows when you're focusing in your thinking in your, and you're focusing on, does that make sense? So the more you think about something, the more that desire grows. So if you, if it's like, you have a little seed of a desire, a little seed of something, you want it to grow, you can't not think about it. You have to start thinking about it. And then as you think about it, think about it more and more and more and the more you think about something, the more it's going to grow. Okay. If you look at all of these old books that he buy and thinking grow rich and all these things about thought and thought control, all sorts of stuff, like, like thoughts come and go, but we can control ourselves. We can think about something we can choose to think about a thing. And if we choose to think about a thing, it'll grow. So if you know, you got a little, a little seed of desire, you want that desire to grow, start thinking about it. Okay. For me, it's like when I decided I wanted to get back into reading scriptures again, right? There was the little desire that that thing was in there. So for me, it's like, okay, I got to start thinking about this. Like, how do I do that? I'm not going to think about it by default. Like, so, uh, you know, my brains are going to also stop like, oh, you should think about the book of John, you know, like that's going to pop in my head. So I started thinking, okay, who are people around me that, that, um, that do have that desire, right? And they're excited. They're passionate. Like, I want to take this little spark and I have, I got to find a fire or somewhere else. And if I take my spark next to the fire, what happens to my spark? It becomes a fire. Right. So for me, it's like, all right, who are the people talking about these topics right now? And so I start finding books and information and podcasts and YouTube videos of people who actually are talking about the same people who are already on fire for the thing that I want to be on fire for, but I'm not yet. I got a spark. They've got a flame, right? To find people of a flame and I start surrounding myself around those people. So I'm listening to them on podcasts and watching them on videos. I'm, I'm, I'm reading their content, reading their books. Like, like, that's how you take the spark and turn it into a fire. Okay. So number one is I'm thinking about all, all the time. Number two is I'm going and finding people who already have a fire and I'm surrounding myself around those people. Okay. There's, there's a reason why people come to funnel hacking live. People tell me sometimes I'm like, I feel like I'm in my house. I'm all lonely by myself and I come to funnel hacking live and I catch on fire. That's what they tell me, right? I catch on fire. Okay. It's interesting. Think about that. So what's happening? They've got a spark of desire. They're at home. They're listening. They're seeing some stuff. They see me. They see like this guy who's like, I'm so passionate about this. I'm on fire. I'm excited. And so like, I need to come and get some of that. I don't know what that is. I want to drink the cool. And I want some of that. What they're doing is they see this, this raging inferno of Russell, right? And they want to come and they want to get their spark close to that. So I think if they do, it'll catch on fire. And it's true. Right. I think about that. Like I'm always looking for people to connect with who are already on fire because I know if I'm around those people will grow. You hear people say all the time, like you are the average of your five closest friends, right? In all sorts of things in your income, right? Right. Whoever your five closest friends are, however, they're making that so much you're going to make. Okay. Same thing with your health, your weight, your energy, like, like whoever you're surrounding yourself, you'll be similar to, right? And there's a couple of reasons. Number one is either because you're going to drive everyone pulled down to your level or number two, you're going to rise them up to your level, right? You're going to be the fire that turns their spark into a fire. Oops. Sorry. And so for me, it's like I'm always searching out people who are on fire. In fact, Andy Ellis speaking of Fun Hockey Live. A lot of people are like, why do you like Andy? Andy, like you messed up in his past. He did some bad things that I'm like, because when I saw Andy online, he was on fire and I wanted that and I messaged him. I like, dude, I don't know what you got, but there's a flame and my, my, my sparks dwindling and I need to light myself on fire. So I called him up, flew out to his office. I spent literally less than 24 hours with him and like his flame was so big that my little spark that was like kind of trembling and struggling, like caught back on fire. I came back home and was like, all right, everybody work like, I took that flame back to my team and then my team caught on fire. Like, and like, that's how this stuff works, right? So you take this desire. And number one, think about all the time. Number two, you had to go and you got to find people who have the inferno and you get proximity, proximity is power. So when you're Robin says all the time, right? Okay. Number three thing here. Um, a lot of times we focus on our future self, the thing we want, right? Our future desire, which is awesome. But thing we forget about a lot of times is that we have this past self that's potentially holding us back. Okay. I've been talking a lot recently about subconscious mind and, um, so many different standpoints, but our subconscious mind is like all the things, the stories we've been telling ourselves for the last, um, you know, decade, two decades, however long it is our entire life, they have these belief patterns, right? So sometimes we're looking at the future. We're thinking about what we want to, what we want to achieve and who we want to become with problem a lot of times is that we have these false beliefs in this baggage we've been carrying around subconsciously. And if we don't look at that and address it and figure out how to break it, then those chains will hold us back. Okay. The best time I've ever taught this so far, if you read expert secrets book, I talk about when I'm trying to persuade somebody, I got to figure out what their chains of false belief are. Okay. These are the subconscious beliefs that they have that are holding them back. And then I have to come with a new empowering story that's going to trump their story. Right. That's what the whole perfect webinars about. I got to, I got to come in with the fire and the flame. And I got to figure out what the false belief is. I tell a story that breaks their false belief and rebuilds with a new false belief. I guess how I get somebody to move into persuade the same thing is true for you. Like if you're trying to change yourself, looking in the future is great. But you also look backwards and like, what are the false beliefs I have? What are actually holding back? I have to address that with conversations. A really good book by Ben Hardy is becoming your future self now. He talks about it like looking backwards like, okay, I got a reframe. I got to change the meaning of these things in the past that are holding back today. Right. What are the things in the past? Like for me, one of the things was holding me back over the last two or three years. I don't know how I'll be super vulnerable. So here we go. Here's the vulnerable Russell. I think you guys like vulnerable Russell. I would get comments afterwards, but, um, you know, one of the hard things for me is, uh, for the last decade, we launched click funnels, right? The first seven or eight years, like 3000 people, one, two comic book boards. We've changed the industry. We've changed so many people's lives and it's been hard for me. Okay. It was really hard. They started looking these people that wanted to comic book board for me, right? Then they go find our competitor. They white label our competitor. There's pictures of them holding a two comic book board. Russell changed my life, but now I'm using this platform, which is theirs. And now they're competing against me. Um, these people that I changed my people are on stage crying, like you changed my life, Russell, if it's so great, now I'm going to compete against you. Like just, I don't know. I have, um, I'm super faithful to people. He probably knows like, I don't quote, I don't, I don't tell somebody an idea that I got from someone else and not give them credit for it. Like, I think it's the lowest, most scum of the world thing you can do is to take credit for somebody else's ideas. You've got for somebody else. I always pay credit to where it's due. I would never in a million years, like with Dan Kennedy or with people that I respect, I never would go and like, and like learn, have them change my life and then go try to rip them off. Like, but it happens. It's been happening a lot. And it's, it's been painful, man. It, um, it was literally painful. And so there was a while, there was a season, probably for a year or two, I was just like, I don't want to help people because they're going to come in and learn my stuff. And then, and then competing against me. Like, like, why would I want to serve that audience? Like it made me so angry and so mad. And it's because the meaning I attached is because that meaning was attached. Right. It was hard to move forward. It was hard to visualize. I'm going to change the world. I'm going to help a million entrepreneurs. I'm going to bubble up because I'm like, screw those entrepreneurs. Like I'm changing their lives. And as soon as like I changed their lives, they lose all loyalty to me. And then they go and like behind my back, go and compete and like promote a competitor, like brutal for me. Right. And so I had to come back and stop and say, looking back. So, okay, what's the meaning of attaching? The meaning of attaching is like, if I help these people in the future, they're going to hurt me. It's not a good meaning, right? Makes you not want to help people. Okay. But I stopped looking at my past self and like, I'll pass myself. That's the fault. I don't know how I got attached. I didn't consciously like attach that, but it started happening. I'd see people with their ads. Then only a two comic couple ward in their ad and then talking about a competitor. I'm just like, I hate those people. I want them all to die. Right. It's not a good thing to say, but that's, that's the meaning that was attached. Right. So it's hard to go get more people and serve more people and that's the meaning that's holding back. Okay. Now what's your meaning? Right. What's the things that are holding you back and you have to stop sometimes look backwards because even though you got good goals and directions, these you say verbally consciously, you want. If your subconscious mind is holding you back, you have to come aware of it and look at it and then you got to look at the meaning you're attaching to these things and then figure out a new story, figure out a new meaning. So for me, it was figure out new meanings. Right. Okay. Um, how do I change this? In fact, it's been interesting. If you look at some of my ads right now selling online event, I used to talk about like I'm a world record holder, Grace, you know, sold more from stage than anybody else in the history of all time. Like, and, uh, and, um, and now if you look at my ads, I've, I keep saying is like, my goal of this event is to have you coming. Cause I'm looking for somebody to beat me. I need some of the beatings in any competition. My right house has been too busy. No one else is competing. So I'm going to train you become the best possible person that you can beat against me so I can beat you. As soon as you beat me, I got motivation to come back and beat you. Okay. Now it's a different frame, right? I'm saying the thing right now. My cool, come in, go ahead and compete against me. Okay. Now I got some motivation, like my number one strength, you take strength, find it by number one strength is competitive. So I'm going to destroy you. So now I like those people instead of like, I can't believe this person would backstab me that way instead. It's like, Oh, cool. All right. You think you're going to win? We could have partnered with good men friends, but now I'm going to beat you. There's a Russell. That's the Russell is going to win. Right. But I had to look at my past self and detach the meaning that was holding you back, retouch a new meaning and then run with that. Okay. So number three there is looking at your past self and explaining, um, looking at what's holding you back and then rewriting those meetings. Okay. And then number four, um, you got to amplify the thing that will get us the value we have most, right? So again, this comes back to talking about earlier, right? Like the value I have is I want to, for me right now, my, my number one, my number one values impact won't change the world. Right. So like there's the big impact, right? And then what's the thing that's going to do that for me? The thing that's going to do that for me is writing books and books is painful for me, right? But I know that's the thing that's going to give me the impact I want. So I have to take that thing, right? The writing the books for me. I have to amplify it by thinking about it. Okay. It comes back to the first thing. It's like thinking about thinking about thinking about amplify, amplify, amplify. The more amplify the more it's like, I love writing books. I love reading books. I love books. And then that thing becomes exciting. And then that drives the value of the future. So there is my Sermon on Desire you guys. It's not everything out there. I'm sure of it's all the things in my head. Like thinking about hopefully something in there was valuable for you. Um, again, the three steps I wrote down, step number one is what do you do? Are what do you already have desire for figuring that out? Right. We do what talk to you through the doubt, the value galaxy, value things story. So what do you already have a desire for? Number two, figure out how to connect the desire to the thing that will actually create the desired result. And number three is then take that desire to increase the desire for that thing amplified as much as you can. So hopefully it was valuable for us. Hopefully you got some, uh, some value. I love to hear in the comments, uh, even the podcast, YouTube, wherever you're watching this, uh, give me some comments on the things that you would do or things you're trying to do or any of your thoughts. You think I'm crazy, right? Russell's are bad ideas. Let me know your ideas. I'd love to hear. Um, but that's kind of the, what I'm working off of right now, uh, to help influence myself, influence other people. And it's been successful for most things. Still try to figure out my kids. They are the hardest ones. I love them the most. So it's going to be worth it when I figure it out. So thanks so much. I appreciate you guys. Thanks for listening to the podcast and hot gels.
