Hey, this is Russell Brunson, and if we haven't officially met yet, I'm literally the worst YouTuber of all time. So we've been having YouTube channel for a long time. We've got a lot of videos in a lot of different places. Some of them have done really well, and a lot of them, the majority of them have been kind of crickets. But the good news is, I'm going to get better. Put your other right track and go. So I want to officially welcome you to my channel. Please give me a thumbs up, like and subscribe. That way we can hang out more often. I can share with you some of the things we're doing. So my name is Russell Brunson. I do a lot of things. I am an introvert, so I struggle talking to you one-on-one, but I love being on stage, talking in front of thousands of people, sharing my ideas and things that I've been blessed with. Welcome to the stage, Russell Brunson! I'm also a father of five amazing kids. I got a beautiful wife. On top of that, I'm also a wrestler. Even though I'm retired and way past my prime, I still go to wrestling tournaments just because I miss it. And on top of that, I'm the serial launch for Newark. I've been very, very focused for the last few years, focusing on click funnels, growing it and scaling it. So right now we are working to build click funnels into a billion-dollar-plus company, and I want to take you guys behind the scenes to show you what we're doing, how we're doing, why we're doing it, and hopefully help give you guys inspiration you need to grow your company as well. So on this channel, I'm going to share with you guys lots of different marketing tips and entrepreneur tips, different ways to grow your company, things that I wish somebody would have told me back when I got started. Here on YouTube, we can show you guys everything. I had to go ask Jeeves for all those things. And I'm actually in the process right now, writing my fourth book, which is my first personal development book in this journey. I'm interviewing some of the top personal development people on the planet. I'm going to be able to bring some of these principles and ideas and things I'm getting from them back to share with you as well. Finally, I want to thank our sponsor, Zuma Juice. Just kidding, they're not actually our sponsor. So recently, I bought Zuma Juice. Now we're about to take it from startup, hopefully a two-comma club, and I want to take you guys on the journey on this channel as well so you can see behind the scenes. All right, so what are we tasting? This is the new Zuma Juice. It wasn't just Zuma Juice, I also bought a Broenbrof company. We bought it in a software company. A whole bunch of cool things we're doing. That way, you can see what we're doing, how we're doing it, and you can model it in your business as well. And most importantly, I want to thank you guys for watching. I obviously have a list of all the video ideas I want to make. I want to make sure that we're doing the things that are going to help you the most as well. Without you, the ClickFunnels members, the Funnel Hackers, the people who are interested in learning marketing business from us, we couldn't be doing this. We're having so much fun. Literally, it's the ride of my life. Without you guys, it wouldn't be possible. So I want to make sure that we're giving you exactly what you're looking for. So in the comments down below, let me know. Let me know if you want more family videos, want more marketing videos, more personal development, whatever you want. Let me know. Even if it's wrestling, we'll do some of those videos as well. And with that said, I appreciate you guys. Thank you so much for watching. Please like, subscribe and turn on notifications down below. And with that said, we'll see you guys on the next video. Bye.
