So not many people admit this but one of the best ways to be successful in life is actually to be kind of selfish Let me explain let me explain. Okay. The term selfish typically means that somebody who's very self-centered and all about themselves Well, that's one definition The other one I want to focus on is being selfish where you are going after something for yourself What is it you want to create? What do you want to do? What do you want to go after and achieve? Initially we started business if your only reason for doing is to help other people There's gonna be times that's gonna be really hard and difficult to have motivation You need to keep moving forward and keep having success There's got to be something in it for you that gives you the drive and the passion to go and actually pursue that thing Otherwise, you're probably not gonna get the finish line Recently I gave a presentation about this whole concept in Mexico with my two comic club X mastermind group It was the first time I'd ever actually shared this concept publicly because I see so many entrepreneurs who struggle with this internal guild So I wanted to share this with you because I want you to understand that it's okay to fill that way And I hope you receive a lot of value from this presentation I'm currently writing a new book on personal development and this presentation is a chapter from that book So I would actually love to hear your comments down the comment section What you think how you feel if you've ever felt that way in the past and so how you've kind of overcome those things and On top of that make sure you click the like button if you enjoyed this and also subscribe so you continue to get all the new videos You're moving forward. Thank you again so much for watching and I hope you enjoyed This is something I struggled with for a long time For those who have read Alice drug or study iron rand or anything her philosophies are Are not soft. Okay. I think most of us are like, oh, yeah, like like we want but like she's she's very very blunt on stuff One of her books is called the virtue of selfishness Which I read the title is like what and she literally like I title this because I wanted to like pattern your people want people like Be upset about it because we need to talk about this self esteem The value of selfishness is that you esteem yourself as a value that you leave according to your nature It says everyone is trying to focus so much on like giving and serving But like the reality is for prime moves her creators like creation comes from a selfish standpoint Now for some of you guys that sound like you heard that you're gonna feel like that That's how I felt the first time like God, no, it doesn't like I'm here to serve Okay, but a couple things she said number one. I want to mention like again I do believe that each has been called deserve that we have these desires Okay, but when you're first called to serve somebody guess what by default those people are going to reject you But Russell I'm called to serve these people. Yeah, eventually they will be grateful for you But right now they will not be grateful. I promise you that okay when I started this mission try to help entrepreneurs Man, it was brutal. I got made fun of I got beat up virtually Horrible things are in about me. I remember sitting at Thanksgiving dinner at my wife's house With sitting on the table before we had any kids and her mom asked me everything's given to your table Russell I googled your name last week and there's a video that says you're a scammer Is that true you scammy people to my brand new mother-in-law? And I was like What And I go to the bathroom I got in the bathroom I googling on my phone my Russell Brunson pops up big old video Russell Brunson's a scam artist Right. I tried to save wrestling in the United States. I built a wrestling team Built a center. I flew all these russets. I flew out coaches. I gave all the wrestlers compete for Olympic team jobs I was like, this is the maze. I'm serving this audience and guess what the wrestling community destroyed me in all the wrestling forms There's this spammer this scammer named Russell. He's like a horrible person. Here's why I It was insane the people your car just serve will reject you initially And so if you're there to try to serve them and that's your fault your full motivation is gonna be very very difficult The initial creation is It's selfish. Okay, you have to focus on the creation a couple quotes from I ran that I think worth we're really interesting She said men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve but to give yet One cannot give that which has not been created creation becomes before Distribution or there will be nothing to distribute the need of the creator comes before the need of any possible beneficiary We're taught to admire the second hander who dispenses the gifts He is not produced above the man who actually made the gifts possible Praise the act of charity and we shrug at the act of achievement The initial desires like I want to become better athlete. I want to make more money I want to be like that is the driving thing at the very beginning Okay, now what's amazing what happens is it through that as you start doing those things and you're selfishly moving forward trying to pursue Your goal your vision thing that you want to have happen the wake of that the byproduct will happen behind you is the contribution That's we have a chance to serve people. How many has watched the documentary The Last Dance? It was so good if you look at Michael Jordan, right? Probably the greatest basketball player ever. He was not like here's this team. Let's build a team is gonna be awesome He was like no, I'm Michael Jordan I'm gonna be the greatest basketball player ever to play and he stood up to the line He started playing and start playing and start playing and people hated him people did not like him He was ruthless. He made fun of people people quit they left He's like I don't care like I'm gonna become the best in the world and he didn't start moving forward and in the wake of him Selfishly pursuing his mission and his goals. He built the greatest basketball dynasty of all time My innate personality is to win at all costs if I have to do it myself I'm gonna do it if it wasn't for me and Todd being a click-phone was being selfish like we want to create something because we know This is here. It's gonna happen. We're making ton of money if we weren't selfish about that in our time and our energy We never created this So you have to understand that because it's gonna be hard for most of us. It was hard for me to be like okay with that I've never publicly talked about this because it's like hard but in my head It's just like it's a very selfish thing any goal You say I want to get a six pack when you have to work out on me stay champ I'll be a national champ like it is a selfish goal. I want to make more money on a billable business It has to be Or it's gonna be hard for you to drive enough to do it But after you've done that the wake of what you create is the contribution Okay, it'll come and now if that's happened then The people will start showing up but initially they don't and so if you're doing it for them, it's not gonna last you got to do it for you You
