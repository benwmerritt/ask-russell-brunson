So, welcome to Hot Lanna. This is where we're staying. We literally have six boxes. One box goes to each table as far as the buyers' packets. When they buy, you hand them that packet. Pretty easy. I mean, it's the same thing we always do. Russell gets up on stage, he kills it. It goes crazy. We take order forms, we run payments. We go home richer. We got a chat ring. Absolutely dude. You guys doing amazing? You hear about the surprise we're doing for Todd tonight? Yeah. Do you know about it? I jaked him in a little bit. So, this is the purpose. I know that if I just asked Todd, he'd say no. And I'm going to give it to him as a gift, because you can't give back a gift. So that's kind of the thing about it. This is your Christmas gift. You can't re-gift your gift. We had to make this a thing and then he allowed to say yes. I hope it works. I know what sweet is that. Do you know who it is? No, but I know Laura. Hi. How are you doing? Nice to meet you. My wife, Collette. Hi, I'm Laura. Nice to meet you. She's also Cliff Finnell's user. She's been donating $2.97 a month. Thank you. I'm going to give it to you. Thank you. Thank you for creating it. It's amazing how many cool things people have done. It's been fun. It's been a crazy ride. Every time. Okay. It's seven o'clock. Should we go to Todd's party right now? It's sweet. It's a little surprising. Can we have a few birthday presents? We're going back to the hotel room. We've got dinner in an hour. What did you think it was? I don't know. Honestly, now I'm way thrown off. Now it reduces churn. I'm not sure what it could be. Todd, you can sit there. Ashley is next to him. Everybody else comes to the couch. We're in the hotel room tonight. We're going to send out all of our friends. There's Todd and Ashley. There's a bunch of other friends. We're about to show Todd the future of ClickFunnels. He doesn't even know yet. Unless he hates it, then it's not the future. It might end right now. What do we got? We've gathered you here today because I knew if I asked you this initially you'd say no. I was like, alright. Now the peer pressure will force you. Jake sat down and designed something that's so freaking amazing. Jake just replaced all the designers. The entire company. They're all gone. It's not like a whole new design other than obviously the on-page onboarding process and then the initial dashboard. You've actually got something designed. I'm excited now. So behind this curtain is hopefully the new ClickFunnels dashboard. OK, you ready for this? Here we go. Oh, nice. Nice. This. I don't know why you're scared. OK, so now my Christmas gift that I want from you is can we get this live by Christmas? By our birthday. Yeah. Maybe. This isn't near as bad as I thought it was going to be. I hate it. I was like, I love this. Such a buildup. I need to bring it. Happy birthday. I do like it. Awesome. Let's get some dinner. So we just woke up and got ready. We were up to like one o'clock last night working on slides and now it shows about to start. So we're heading down there to the event room. I'm a little nervous. I'm going to be doing a presentation. It's only an hour. You just need 90 minutes. And we're selling a $500 product. All new things. New variables. Three new variables. But the reason why I said yes is because I literally retired from public speaking outside of Funlacking Live after the TEDx one. But we wanted to change a presentation and test one out so that the speaker team can do one. Because most people aren't letting them have 90 minutes on stage and most people don't want them to sell $3,000 off right. So that's how it works. And then I'll have a recording. Then I can then get the speaker team so they can learn the pitch. And so that's really the main reason I'm doing this is just to create a presentation for them. You'll notice in these slides I don't talk about myself at all. I've got my stories in there. That's by design because I want to make this where Dave could literally do his presentation tomorrow. He just changes one slide. Dave would work to click one on instead of Russell would to click one on. And so that's how we're doing it. Good to have you here. Just in case I ran into you. I was hoping you would sign these. That'd be awesome. What are the chances of that? I was like, if you're going to think I'm crazy. Running around with these books. Hoping I'm going to run into a surprise. We can awesome. Thank you. Where are you from? Yes. Hold on. Right. Hold up for it. Yeah, hold on. Awesome. And thank you. See you. Thanks. Thank you. Sorry. I'll take the cool body. Thank you so much. Go quick. They got to go. We're in trouble. We're in trouble. What's up? Get out of here. Good to see you. I've been seeing you for a bunch of years. How you been? Amazing. How about you? Amazing. I wouldn't have expected anything less. Don't be nervous. I do get nervous every time. Really? I get sleep before. I do. Literally, I fall asleep before. If you see me before, I'm not now. Cool. Great to see you. The anxious nerves before you go on. And it's like, also you get tired. So it's like, I don't know, it's like the yawn. The adrenaline gets up and you get tired from it. And then you're like, you're yawning. I can't be asleep. I've done $500 off from stage ever in my history, my career, even like way back in the day. So I think it should be super easy to sell. But I've also never done 60-minute presentations. So hopefully, the shrinking time will be okay with the shrinking the price. And hopefully I don't go 90 minutes because I have no time this year. Okay, good luck. You look beautiful. Thank you. You're going to kill it. Bring the energy to this place. It's like rushing. I must have like 20 slides. I must have said like 30 slides. Awesome, thank you. I got a warm inside which got great. But the back side is so disengaged. So basic. How are you doing in Brussels? Francie, nice to meet you. She knows you because everybody knows Russell. So you probably know who I was. Yeah, I actually met you at saying event like eight or nine years ago. You look different than... actually someone posted a picture of you. And I'm like, you're like more like round. I was a little heavier. I lost a little weight since then. I was a little back then. So people still think I'm a little based on how they met me eight years ago. They're like, you don't make... When did you meet him eight years ago? I'm like, we'll do get older. And they do mature. Russell, I'm going to do it. We just get their energy up and do a couple of giveaways before I... Before I do it. Rock it. Have a great time. I hate this part. It's the worst. I hate this part. Oh man, I'm so excited to be here with you guys today. You've never heard of funnels before? We are going to blow your mind today. I'm so excited. All right. I was growing. I was learning things were good. But when I started teaching other people and sharing these things with other people, that's when my growth really started happening. So it's that shift from growth to contribution. It's so simple and so easy. That's why we say we just be free to entrepreneur. No longer have to call a tech person to go do all these things. You just do it. Like momentum is the secret. This is not hard. That sound good? Thank you guys so much for letting me be here. And I'll see you live next Monday with the challenge start. Thanks everybody. My tongue is tired. You were on fire. Great job. Are you up right now? We'll sell back. So if you guys are going to have fun, cool. If you want to meet up for lunch, let me know. At least stop in the audience. We got married on Sunday. The last Sunday? They already happened? We're going to Italy to do it. With just our family. It was too much complication. Last Saturday, why don't we get married tomorrow? So you do a ceremony there then? Yeah. Just as please get them over. Done. Good luck up there. I unzipped my shoes. Call us your mind. Hey everybody. I'll be your director. You know Gene already, right? How's it going? Good to see you. So I just want to have a seat. Yeah, Russell Kenoszaki's producer, executive director. Also a member of your Tukamalabana. Yeah, it's awesome. Let's go and have a seat here. Good to go then. Get the slate. We're saying. Russell Brunson, take one. Hey friends, it's Gene McNaughton with Success Resources. It is an absolute honor to have our guest here, Russell Brunson. Thank you man. Thanks for being here. I notice in your marketing, you're always giving something first. You're giving the blueprint. In your podcast, you're sharing the exact details of the situation, what you did, and how you drove the outcome. Now there's a lot of people that market, market, market and make all the big promises, but you're giving things up first. How does that work for you? I think it's really like the longer game. You can always trick people into giving you money or something like, oh I'm going to show you this secret thing, but you're going to pay me, but then the person doesn't buy again. They buy once and it's like a weird relationship. And I was like, I want to be in this business for a decade or 10, I want to keep on longevity. And so because of that, you have to give a lot and the law of reciprocity comes back. I've had people literally, we had a kid that day that bought my book. This is probably two years ago. Went through it, built a big company, won a bunch of awards from us, and then he joined my high-end coaching program. He's like, I feel guilty. I've paid $7.95 for the book, and made this whole business. He's like, I'm giving you money. I don't even want to be in your coaching program, but I feel like I owe you that much money back. So he gave us $25,000 to join this program just because he felt obligated, because we just had given so much. And I think nowadays with social media and stuff, whoever is giving the most, the ones that people follow and they keep plugging into and keep tuning into, and so we try to give a ton. And when you do that and you help people at a little level, they want more and they just keep following and keep engaging at higher levels with you. Talk about how important goal setting is for you. Oh, it's so important. It's funny because a lot of times we think we set a goal. It's like, we don't have the goal. I'm a failure. It's like, no, you set a goal. You miss it. Okay, what's the new goal? And it's kind of more of a, it's more flexible. I grew up, I was a wrestler, and so I always had I wanted to be a state champ and then a national champ. And, but along that path, I would lose tons of matches, but I'd lose a match, look at it, what if any tweak can change, and then come back again and come back again. Eventually I got to those goals. And the biggest thing is a lot of people set goals and sometimes they get fearful, because like, oh, but if I don't hit it, then I'm a failure and it's like, set a goal and then start running towards it, but be okay if it fails. Like, what are the adjustments that you make? Reset the goal and go again. Reset the goal, go again, and just keep going, because that's the best part of life, is the chasing of it, you know? You get the goal, it's never as cool, like getting your hand raised with the wrestling mat or, you know, cashing the checks, never as cool as the journey. And so it's just like enjoying the journey and just keep resetting the goals and don't freak out about the failures. And I remember you saying, I've got this other opportunity that I'm working on, I've got this other thing, and that I believe was the beginning of Click Clips. How did it originate? When did you say this is what the world needs? Yeah, you never know till that's the fascinating thing about the market. You never know what's going to hit until you put it out there. So I was trying thing after thing, and, you know, we had been helping entrepreneurs for a long time, like teaching them and coaching them and having fun with that, but every single entrepreneur always got stuck on the technical parts. Like, they'd conceptually understand, okay, that's what I need to do, and then like, how do I actually do that? You know, they didn't know, and it was hard for them to progress. And so, I have my business partner Todd, who's the best developer I've ever met. He was like, I think I could build something that makes this easy. So he started that process of building it, and it was funny because as he would get iterations of it done, he'd like, here try it. And I would try to do stuff, and I'm like, how does it work? I don't understand. He's like, I failed. And I'm like, well, tell me. He's like, no, if you can't figure it out, then we failed. And so they had people like record videos of me trying to use it, and if I got stuck, he's like, hey, I do it again. He kept going back until it was simple enough that I could do it. And as I was able to start doing, like, building these web pages and funnels that I've been like, always having to hire people, and when I could do it, I was like, oh my gosh, there's something here. Like, this is simple enough that any entrepreneur could do it. And then we were just like, okay, this is the focus. We ended up shutting down and selling off every other business, and just went 100% in. And next month will be our five-year birthday since the launch of Clif Funnels, and it's just been all-consuming and like the most the craziest ride in my life. It's a wrap. Where's the bathroom? Just kidding. He's kidding, not really. Kidding, not kidding. Thanks everybody. Hey everybody, real fast. I just want to express a massive amount of appreciation to you guys. For us, one of the main things we really wanted to get out of this that made it successful for us, and that was to be able to actually have a video from of Russ will actually doing this presentation. We've never done it before. But for us, it was just awesome, and I'm so appreciative for you guys, each and every single one of you. Once all this processing and stuff is done, I hope you guys have a fun time. Go out and enjoy Atlanta. And again, thank you guys so much. I can't say enough about how awesome you guys are. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I just want some order, man. See, listen, this is the problem. If they had a funnel, we'd be able to just get through this whole thing without being confused. But this is a website, man. This is chaos. Do I want dolphin coast? Do I want topical diver? I don't know. I don't know where to go. I don't know where to go.
