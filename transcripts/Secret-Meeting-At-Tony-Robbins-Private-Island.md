Hey, this is Russell Brunson and right now I'm in Fiji. I'm in Namali. So what we're doing on this trip, this is actually the affiliate prize for the mastermind.com launch, which was literally the biggest launch in the history of the internet, as far as we know, close to $40 million in sales over like a week and a half period of time, which is crazy. And so the top 10 affiliates all got a ticket to come here and spend the week in Fiji together. You guys either did this because you just had faith in us, not because of previous numbers, it was a whole new world, a whole new genre, a whole new product. Some of you were just dear friends and like, I just want to say how much we both appreciate this and I appreciate that you guys went in blind and got so behind this mission and this passion Tony and I have. So I just want to tell you, it's really cool to be here after just a whiteboard discussion and a desire to help make self education the new norm. And I knew I couldn't do it without really great strategic partners and you guys are the partners. So thank you so much. We're truly grateful. Let's have a great five days. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Tony likes to start every event with a physical stretch. Anybody walk on fire? Anybody walk on fire? Right. You're only born with two human fears. You're born with the fear of loud noises. Second fear you're born with is fear of heights. Every other fear you have is learned. There's candles on your table right now. You're scared of them because they're hot but you learned that fear of heat. If you've got a kid that's two or four years old, they're scared of the dark. But under two, they're not scared of the dark because they haven't learned that yet. At eight or ten, they've unlearned that fear. The fears we have about am I good enough, tall enough, skinny enough, smart enough, pretty enough, rich enough, all those fears are learned. But the other fear you're born with is the fear of heights. Everybody has it. And so we're going to go climb some poles tomorrow and do some cool stuff. All right. That was kind of vague on what the poles and ropes think. We'll look at that car. If we get ourselves in a circle, we're going to miss. We're going to conspire to beat the other team, to be quicker, to have more fun, to have more energy, to be more inspired. Energy. In your business, if you bring energy and passion to your business, does it change the game? Yes or no? If you're standing here like, holy s***, that's probably not the right energy you need to bring to this experience. In almost all of life, and I've worked this from Tony, if you bring a sense of fun and possibility to anything you do, can you guys make anything happen? Yes or no? Yes. So get with your team. In your team, I'm going to direct you to a quick circle right now. Let's go, baby. Let's go, baby. Give me a jump. What's up? So I'm so internally petrified right now. Oh, one step at a time. These are wobbly. Hey, look, you can make it from there. Step up. Let's go! Easy, let's go! Yeah! This is easy. Hmm. Funny enough, some people, when they come to the pole, they see the trapeze and they think, oh, what I'm supposed to do is catch the trapeze. Some people in life are chasing things that they didn't put in front of them, somebody else put in front of them. So if you get to the top of the pole and you decide based on where you're at in life right now that you need to stretch, you need to push, you need to strive towards something, then great, go get with your pace. Ready, alive or enthusiastic? Okay, six and seven should be getting geared up. Six and five. I'm six. But for some of you, you've already mastered the science of achievement. How many of you have mastered the science of getting done? How many of you are going to get done? Raise your hand. So while you're here, for some of you, a bigger challenge will be to climb the top of the pole, find your balance, do something extraordinary. Watch this, do this. Go. Look at the view and just take a damn moment in your life. Does that make sense? For some of you, that's your challenge. And maybe not catch the trapeze, but do this. Let come up whatever needs to come up. There's no right or wrong. There's no perfect. There's no do-over. Have a beautiful experience. I came by the last one. Oh, look at that shot. That's the first one. Halfway. Oh, you landed it. Oh, the only one that landed it. How many of you enjoyed being supported by your team? Yeah. And I think that's the key lesson. I think Tony, of all the things he teaches, nothing of significance in life is ever going to happen without a team. Sometimes life is only fun if you deal with some other folks you can share about it. So. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. So when we look around, hallelujah, we thank the Lord for everything that's surrounding us. Amen. Meeting my wife was my first prayer. Amen. Hallelujah. Come on. Hallelujah. That's right. There's some monsters out there. There he is. I'll be. If you ever feel like you're in the dungeon of love. Crick the link below. Crick the link below. Crick the link below. That water's warm here. Like we really believe that Tide lifts all boats. Tony's had 20 more years than me. I don't pretend that I'm on the same level as Tony, but second to Tony, there's not many people that have been in it longer than me and done the revenue I do. So between the two of us, I think when we're dead some day and 40 years ago, I'm like, remember when that shift happened where people decided it was okay not to go to college and it was okay to do this, right? So everybody says you guys did that in 13 days. I said that last night, it's the truth. It took us 60 years to figure out how to do 40 million in two weeks, you know? But what I'd love to know and Tony asked me this last night, he goes, did you ask them what more could we do for this group to help you guys when we launched in February? Because you guys really worked hard for us and we appreciate it. And there's a couple things that we're doing. This year besides Tony's dedicated to do more podcasts than he's ever done, I'm going to fly around the country and do a podcast with everybody I possibly can. We're also doing something, Tony's got the best PR lady on the planet. We're going to spend a ton of money. I kept talking about OmniPresent during the launch and we hit that just like you want to do with your book launch, right? We had 1100 affiliates. Every feed you went on Facebook, it didn't even matter if you, every feed, everything was about KBB. Every podcast that launched was about KBB. Every ad that was, it was just, it was unbelievable. This year we're going to put in the element and we're probably going to spend half a million bucks on straight PR. Like get on the cover of Fast Company, get on the cover of Inc, get on the cover of Success. Like we're strategizing that right now and the cool part, Tony has access to all of that and they all want it anyway. So we'll be on the cover of everything and it's all going to come out in February. Tony's so emotionally invested. He's in the Facebook group nonstop reading all these positive comments. The software where we got, you know, we're spending, I think we just got the bill, the estimates going to be 620 grand on the software alone to build out all these great features that I would want to use for an X level. So we're going to have a great story on how we upgraded. We're going to have, we'll be 25,000 people strong by the time we launch, but I just would love to know what we could do for you guys. If there's anything we could do to help you guys, you were there for us. We want to give back to you. But anyway, I'm not saying, just remember to just keep freaking wherever you are, just keep pushing the notch up. And again, we were talking yesterday and I meant that. If you feel that you're a lifestyle entrepreneur, it makes no difference. Sometimes I feel obsessive. Like every time I get to a certain point, I'm like, I could, I couldn't spend the money I have for the rest of my life. I should be done. And I still, I work like I'm 20 year old and hungry. I do because I'm an achievement based entrepreneur. Like I just want to keep growing and achieving. And I have friends that I love dearly that make two and a half million dollars a year and they don't need a dollar more. They love their life. They golf four times a day or they, they do all the things they do for me. As long as I can be a good husband, a good dad, make an impact on the world, the rest of my time, I want to just keep growing. But that, maybe I'm obsessive and maybe Tony's obsessive, maybe half for you obsessive, but just identify either. And if, if you're a lifestyle entrepreneur, then do everything in your power to anchor in the right people, the SOPs, know your KPIs, be able to look in a glance to make sure your company's going and go travel the world. And maybe you'd be a lifestyle entrepreneur until you have kids and then you go accomplishment based, right? Just know that difference because a lot of this conversation for someone like maybe where you're at, Jen is like, I don't want to do all that crazy. I don't want 200 employees. I don't want to jet. I just, I just want to make two million bucks a year. That's great. But if, once you identify that, then you know, all right guys. Hey, I appreciate you guys. Thank you. It's Cavat time. Once again, welcome to carbonite here at the Molly. Uh, cover is a traditional drink here in Fiji. It's a non-alcoholic drink. Uh, it relaxes the muscle. You'll sleep like a rock, but you don't have any hangovers having cover. Okay. After they put the cover into your cover cup, you drink the whole thing. And after you drink, you clap three times. Remember to clap after you drink. If you won't clap, this cover security is around. They'll give you a penalty ball. See, you can show us the penalty ball. You know we lost the penalty ball? Not me. Not me. We've got to be in Tony's home and his personal, like, world. And one thing he wanted me to share, and I want to share with you guys, access to a party Tony that the world doesn't usually get. So take that as a really great compliment for him to feel that comfortable. Keep it with us so we can have another great year like this. That sound good? Thank you guys. It's an amazing night. We still got three more days.
