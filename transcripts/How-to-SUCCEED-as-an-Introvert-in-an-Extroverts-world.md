## Transcript
Today we were talking about what it's like being an introvert inside of an extrovert's calling. Here we go. Last week was a little bit insane. There was an event that I wanted to speak out for a long time and got invited about six or seven months ago. Dave and I jumped in a plane flew out there to LA and then that night we got the warrior event and so we decided to sneak in. The warrior was insane. 600 men just like insane. Everyone dressed in black and it was really cool because I was teaching a lot of the expert secrets book stuff but as I was teaching it to them I was also showing how Garrett had done it to create the warrior movement. It was really kind of cool to be like here's this piece of it. Here's how I did it. Here's what Garrett did and here's what you needed to do and then kind of go through the whole thing. So I'm on stage, hundreds of people, everyone's cheering. It's like I love that. That's me as the rustle the extrovert. I love that my calling in life and in businesses requires me to do that and be good at that. It's like I stand on stage for all these people and entertain and inspire and hopefully give them the tools they need to be able to move forward. But a lot of people know that's not natural to me. I'm not naturally very extroverted. In fact, my whole entire life up until probably 10 years ago when I kind of started into this business before I realized I had to start learning how to speak and talk. I was super introverted. In fact, I still am very introverted. But when I'm in those situations, I'm at an event and I'm on stage. It comes out of me. I love it. I really, really enjoy it. But it's funny because Dave who's there at all these events, he's doing it. You're on stage, you're in present and you're doing your thing and you're loving it and you're on stage and someone comes to ask you a question and you're just like shrinking this weird introverted. You can tell I'm not comfortable in that kind of a situation. And then it's funny, we were home, flew home, we got back to my house about midnight and the next morning at 8 o'clock, we had this big Christmas party that my wife was in charge of. So we get there and there's all entire church and all these people and all this stuff. And it's just interesting because I come in and totally introverted, rustle, took over, not comfortable in that situation. I'm kind of sat down on the table with my kids and there's always amazing people that go to church with us that I know who they are. I like them. I like them a lot and there's just a bunch of guys that I really think are just awesome. And it's so weird how much fear I have to go and just go say hi to them. It's like I hated about that. That's one thing I really frustrate myself because I remember sitting there the whole Christmas party looking around seeing all these amazing people and people that I'm fascinated by. I was like, I'm going to go talk to that person and I'm going to go ask them a question. I want to do whatever and just honestly have so much fear. All this fear that keeps me from going and just going and saying hi and just going and talking to them. And then even when they do come say hi to me or whatever, I'm really going to carry on a conversation when people come and ask me questions. But when it's like we're on neutral ground and they don't really know much about me or whatever, I really struggle. I'm just not as good at that. Anyways, it's just fascinating. It was just the contrast of the night before I was on stage with all these people and the next day I'm around people that live near me and I can't even like... Anyway, that's a little glimpse of what it looks like. I'm introvert and extrovert's position or calling. So, unless you think that I've got everything put together, I still get scared to death. Don't feel bad if you are like, I'm too introvert. I'm never going to be good at this business. I don't dare talk to people like, I get that. My thoughts are like, it's really hard to like face to face one on one selling. I can stand in front of a room of a thousand people or five thousand people and sell. And extrovert in me is like, yes, this is going to be awesome. I'll step on stage. I'll speak, I'll sell. Like it was so much fun and then afterwards in the hallway, they want to ask me questions when I'm like, I get awkward and weird. Oh man. Well, hopefully someday I figured it out. Hope it helps those introverts out here to understand how it is. You can still succeed in extrovert's world. I'm doing this stuff to an expert's secret stuff, putting your voice out there, putting your message out there. Because when all is said and done, the only thing that really matters is the impact you have on people's lives. So, do it. It's worth it. And at first, you're not going to be very good, but if you're consistent with it, you will get better and better and better.
